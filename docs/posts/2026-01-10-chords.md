## Chord Progressions

Harmonization of a melody can make or break a song. I find myself drawn to some progressions (for
example, I love songs with secondary dominants, that hit the IV on the chorus).

The good book already supports nashville proression search, and we have a mehcanism to link songs to
Strum Machine (which is one of my favoirte tools out there). But, I feel like needed a mechanism to
explore progressions independant of songs.

I want to play with different inversions / octaves, calculate routes back to the root, play with a
progression then find all songs in the database that has that progression.

I worked on this feature for a bit, and then couldn't get it to feel right - I don't want to
re-invent strum machine, I wanted some way to explore harmonies and search harmonies. 

Anyway, I made progress but not super happy with it. I think what I really wanted was like some kind
of progression drum pad that I could have open in a window while trascribing songs that I can't find
lyrics and chords for - something more convenient than holding a guitar or banjo so I can stick to
my computer while trascribing.

Anywy here's the [demo page](), maybe I'll come back to it some day. Actually, I think I'll do the
drum pad idea - that's literally what I needed.
