Hey y'all! I'm starting this dev blog to share updates about what I'm building on BluegrassBook.com.

## What's New

Here are some recent additions:

- **Field-specific search** - You can now search by specific fields like `artist:hank williams` or `lyrics:lonesome highway`
- **Exclusion filters** - Add a minus to exclude results: `tag:bluegrass -tag:instrumental`
- **Search tips** - Click the `?` next to the search bar for a quick syntax reference

## What's Next

I'm working on a few things:

- User-contributed genre tags
- More fiddle tunes from TuneArch
- Better mobile experience

Stay tuned!
