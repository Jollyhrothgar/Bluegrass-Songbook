Hi folks! I'm starting this dev blog to share updates about what I'm building on BluegrassBook.com.

This is my first post, but here's a little history for how this came about.

Bluegrass is an incredible "in-person" activity, that thives on printed out songbook binders,
slow-jams, festivals, wunderkind jams - but the knowledge and musical corpus are spread far and wide
and not really centralized anywhere.

There are some phenemonal tools don't get me wrong:
- www.strummachine.com
- www.bluegrasslyrics.com
- ... and then a million other small websites with a lot of overlap.

I wanted to bridge the gap from bluegrasslyrics.com to strummachine by creating a repository of real
bluegrass (and bluegrass adjacent music, and songs that I cover with my band and turn into
bluegrass).

I hate all these apps that wall you into keeping your songbooks in some ipad library, and then
charge you to do simple stuff like move it somewhere else - especially because the corpus of
bluegrass music belongs to the bluegrass community.

So I built this site to solve this problem once and for all. And I hope it stays online for a long
time.
