{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Well I left one early mornin' 
When the dew was like a blanket on the [F]grass
[G7]And I said goodbye to Norma 
In a note without a forwarding [C]address
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Well my life seemed kinda dull 
Compared to all the things I'd heard and read [F]about
Well [G7]there wasn't much excitement in our town 
So I decided to get [C]out
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well that ol' grey dog 
Was kind enough to carry me away for seven [F]skins
Lawd and we [G7]rolled into Chicago 
Just in time to catch the rain and the howlin' [C]winds
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Well the cottage streets and overtones 
Of sex and violence ripped me to the [F]core
Lawd and I [G7]stood the mass confusion 
For a while but I can't take it any[C]more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Gotta get back to [F]Norma 
And the world I left [C]behind
Gotta get back to [G7]Norma 
And the Norma frame of [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Well I'm a goin' home to mockin' birds 
Picnics on a Sunday afte[F]rnoon
Lawd and my [G7]lust for life is over 
And the air has all gone out of my [C]balloon
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Well I've had my fill of unruly nights 
Women that are classified as [F]broads
And I'm a [G7]goin' home to sweet Norma 
Get a little closer to my [C]Lord
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
Gotta get back to [F]Norma 
And the world I left [C]behind
Gotta get back to [G7]Norma 
And the Norma frame of [C]mind
{end_of_verse}
