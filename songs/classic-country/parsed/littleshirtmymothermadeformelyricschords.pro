[C]I can't forget the day that I was [G7]born

She [F]washed me all over I re[C]member
And [F]after powder-puffin' me you [C]see

In the [G7]little shirt my mother made for [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
When I began to crawl it was a [G7]site
I used to frighten mom from morn till [C]night

For [D7]when my daddy he came home from [G7]work
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Every [F]night he would say where's little [C]Sam got
As [F]down the kitchen happy as could [C]be

The first day that I wore my knicker[G7]bocks

I looked a little picture they did [G7]say
But [D7]when they let me out to run and [G7]play
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Well [F]I didn't like the britches I was [C]wearin'
And [F]in the street I took 'em off you [C]see
I started walkin' home so bold and [F]darin'
In the [G7]little shirt my mother made for [C]me
{end_of_verse}

To [D7]have a swim but in a minute [G7]oh
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
All the [F]girls along the beach at me were [C]starin'
And [F]some were takin' pictures I could [C]see
Was a good thing for me that I was [F]wearin'
The [G7]little shirt my mother made for [C]me
{end_of_verse}
