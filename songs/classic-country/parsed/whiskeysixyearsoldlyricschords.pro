[G]I noticed that your socks don't match this [D7]morning

[G]This is one fight you [D7]can't afford to [G]lose

You better get up drink a cup sober up and stay [D7]home
I don't know where you went 
But you spent about a hundred dollars till [G]dawn
And than your intoxication you'd better find the appreciation
For the [C]woman waitin' for you
And tell me [D7]how can a whiskey only six years old
Whip a man that's thirty-[G]two

Your head is achin' and your hands just won't stop [D7]shakin'
