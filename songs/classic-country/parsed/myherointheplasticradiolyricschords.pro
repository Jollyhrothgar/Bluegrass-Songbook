{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Every morning of my childhood he’d come to wake [C]up 
I’d [D7]hear his friendly [C]voice at half passed [G]five
He’d give the morning weather then he’d play a country [C]song
Those [D7]heartfelt songs that [C]almost made me [G]cry
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
When he talked [D7]of things out yonder I could close my eyes and [C]see
The [D7]places that I’d [C]someday like to [G]go
He gave me my opinion of what I’d like to [C]be
My [D7]hero in the plastic [G]radio
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now I’m stranded here in Denver my clothes to old to [C]clean
I [D7]played at least ten [C]thousand one night [G]stands
But I still recall him a talking about a man with a crippled [C]life
Determined [D7]he would [C]sing his songs [G]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
So I’m really [D7]not a failure though you might think I’m [C]close
It’s [D7]just that I’ve got [C]a little ways to [G]go
Someday he’ll hear me singing and I hope he plays my [C]song
My [D7]hero in the plastic [G]radio
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
So I’m really [D7]not a failure though you might think I’m [C]close
It’s [D7]just that I’ve got [C]a little ways to [G]go
Someday he’ll hear me singing and I hope he likes my [C]song
My [D7]hero in the plastic [G]radio
{end_of_verse}
