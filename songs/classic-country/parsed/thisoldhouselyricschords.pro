{meta: title This Old House}
{meta: artist Mel Tillis}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]This ole house once knew my children
[C7]This ole house once knew my [F]wife
This ole house was home and [G7]comfort
As we [C]fought the [F]storms of [C]life
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
This ole house once rang with laughter
[C7]This ole house heard many [F]shouts
Now she trembles in the [G7]darkness
When the lightning walks [C]about
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Ain't a-gonna need this house no [F]longer
Ain't a-gonna need this house no [C]more
Ain't got time to fix the [G7]shingles
Ain't got time [C]to fix the floor
Ain't got time to oil the [F]hinges
Nor to mend the window [C]pane
Ain't a-gonna need this house no [G7]longer
I'm a-getting ready to meet the [C]saints
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
(like #1)
This ole house is a-getting shaky
This ole house is a-getting old
This ole house lets in the rain
This ole house lets in the cold
On my knees I'm getting chilly
But I feel no fear nor pain
Cause I see an angel peeking
Through a broken window pane
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
(like #2)
This ole house is afraid of thunder
This ole house is afraid of storms
This ole house just groans and trembles
When the night wind flings its arms
This old house is getting feeble
This ole house is needing paint
Just like me its tuckered out
But I'm a-getting ready to meet the saints
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
(like #1)
This ole hound dog lies a-sleeping
He don't know I'm gonna leave
Else he'd wake up by the fireplace
And he'd sit there and howl and grieve
But my hunting days are over
Ain't gonna hunt the coon no more
Gabriel done brought in my chariot
When the wind blew down the door
{end_of_verse}
