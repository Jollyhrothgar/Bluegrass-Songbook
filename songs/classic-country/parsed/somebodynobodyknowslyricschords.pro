[C]Alone in a barroom a young girl is [C7]sitting

And she [G7]stares now and then at the eyes of the men
In the mirror that hangs on the [C]wall  [G7]

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
She's [C]waiting for someone and knowing there's [C7]no one
Who [F]cares if she comes or she [C]goes

She's somebody nobody [C]knows [C7]

In a [G7]city where nobody [C]cares
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Down in the gutter an old man had [C7]fallen

He's somebody nobody [C]knows
