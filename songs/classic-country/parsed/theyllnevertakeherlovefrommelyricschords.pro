{meta: artist Hank Williams}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]If today the sun should set on all my hopes and [C]cares
There is [D7]one who's smiling face that God would [G]see
'Cus she'll walk along beside me up the golden [C]stairs
No they'll [D7]never never take her love from [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
What a [C]fool I was to go and break the trust she [G]gave
And see her love turn into [D7]sympathy
It's the one [G]regret I'll carry with me to my [C]grave
Oh they'll [D7]never never take her love from [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I'm so thankful for each golden hour of [C]happiness
That we [D7]shared together in the used to [G]be
Someone else's arms may hold her now in fond [C]caress
But they'll [D7]never never take her love from [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I [C]thought I'd make her happy if I stepped [G]aside
But I knew her love would never set me [D7]free
And even on [G]the morning she became another's [C]bride
I said they'll [D7]never never take her love from [G]me
{end_of_verse}
