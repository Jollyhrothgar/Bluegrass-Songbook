With a [F]good saddle [G7]horse for a [C]friend

I [C]like what I [F]do and the [G7]pleasure it [C]brings
Even [F]when I'm a[G7]lone I don't [C]mind

I [C]come out a[G7]head every [C]time

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I [Am]love to hear sucker rods [A#7]dance in the pipe
A [F]thump of a checks that they [G7]seal

The [C]song of the [F]whippoorwill [G7]lulls me to [C]sleep

But the [F]sound the winds [G7]makes as it [C]rotates the [F]blades
Says I'm [C]pumping cool [G7]water for [C]you
