{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I can hear the [D7]rain it's falling [G]softly
As I watch him [E7]lying next to [A7]me
[G]I can feel his [D7]heart its beating [G]softly
He just loved me so [Am]tenderly 
[A7]But it should be [D7]you and [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
When he touches me [D7]I feel your [G]fingers
And each time we [E7]kiss I see your [A7]face
[G]When he locks the door behind [D7]us
[G]Then he thinks the world can't find [C]us
[G]But he can't say no he can't [Am]say
[A7]That it should be [D7]you and [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
So I'll just close my eyes [D7]and dream about [G]you
Cause every time I [E7]dream you're always [A7]there
[G]Then you'll lock the door behind [D7]us
[G]And in my dreams the world can't find [C]us
[G]And it will be so real [Am]to me
[A7]It's finally [D7]you and [G]me
{end_of_verse}
