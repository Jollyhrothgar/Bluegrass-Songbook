{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Day after day and for hour upon precious [F]hour
I've [G7]held you and marvel at love that stayed fresh as a [C]flower
From daylight to nightfall through sunlight and rainfall
Our spark hasn't [C7]once lost its [F]glow
My arms have entwined you but [C]never confined you
I'd [G7]die if you left but I [A#7]want you to [F]feel free to [C]go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]Feel free to go if my love ever feels like a [C]chain around your heart
[G7]Stay cause you want me [D7]not cause you feel like you're [G7]tied
I [C]love you I need you a love that so few people [F]know
I [G7]want you to stay but I [A#7]want you to [F]feel free to [C]go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
If we should ever come to the forks in the road you [F]go your way
And [G7]never look back in regret that you hurt me in [C]some way
For right now if the sun stopped and all of the fond stop
My cup would [C7]still over[F]flow
For you've been a treasure [C]beyond any measure
I'd [G7]die if you left but I [A#7]want you to [F]feel free to [C]go
{end_of_verse}

[G7]Stay cause you want me [D7]not cause you feel like you're [G7]tied
I [C]love you I need you a love that so few people [F]know
I [G7]want you to stay but I [A#7]want you to [F]feel free to [C]go
