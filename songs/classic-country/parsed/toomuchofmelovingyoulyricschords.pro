[C]Last night [Em]I almost [C][G7]told someone [A7][F]a [Dm]lie
[G7]But that's when I felt your memory [C]come [G7][Dm]alive
[C]So there's [Em]just no [G7]chance of [C]finding [F]someone [Dm][A7]new
[G7]Cause there's [Dm]much [G7]too much of me still [C]loving [G7][Dm]you

[C]I wish [Em]that I [G7]could close [C]my eyes [F]and [Dm][A7]see
[G7]What keeps [Dm]holding [G7]on so deep inside [Dm][C]of [G7]me
[C]Then the [Em]tear that [G7]finds my [C]cheek gives [F]me the [Dm][A7]clue
[G7]That there's [Dm]much too [G7]much of me still loving [C]you
{end_of_verse}

[F]There's much too much of [G7]me still not [C]free
[D7]And there's much too much of you [Dm]still holding [G]on to [G7]me
[C]I'd be [Em]satisfied [G7]just [C]knowing that [F]we're [Dm][A7]through
[G7]But there's [Dm]much too much [G7]of me still loving [C]you
