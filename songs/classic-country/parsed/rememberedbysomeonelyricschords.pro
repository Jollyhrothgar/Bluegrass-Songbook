[G]I hope you have good times to [D7]help see you through

And in [D7]time you will find what I already [G]knew

And then if there's room in [D7]your memory

{end_of_verse}

Well love you've gotta a lot of [D7]learning to do
A lot of leaving and yearning well I [G]know I do too
By the time you [G7]make up your [C]mind what to [Am]do
You'll [D7]find it's too late for me and for [G]you
