{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]One evening long ago as the [C]sun was sinking low
My true [D7]lover went to sail upon the [G]sea
It was in the month of June when the [C]roses were in bloom
When he [D7]tucked me in his arms and said to [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You’re a flower that is blooming in the wildwood
A flower that is blooming there for [D7]me
Sweeter [G]than the morning dew and I’ll [C]soon return to you
You’re a [D7]flower that is blooming there for [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
A letter came to me from the [C]captain on the sea
That [D7]told me my darling was [G]dead
Oh the shock and great surprise made the tear[C]drops dim my eye
When I [D7]thought about the last words that he [G]said
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You’re a flower that is blooming in the wildwood
A flower that is blooming there for [D7]me
Sweeter [G]than the morning dew and I’ll [C]soon return to you
You’re a [D7]flower that is blooming there for [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Now he can’t return to me he was [C]drowned in the sea
And has [D7]passed over life’s weary [G]way
When it’s in the month of June and the [C]roses are in bloom
It [D7]seems that I can hear my lover [G]say
{end_of_verse}

Sweeter [G]than the morning dew and I’ll [C]soon return to you
