{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]She looks upon [Fm]me as a [C]man she can lean on
Someone to depend upon who [D7]won't let her [G7]down
She [C]brings out the [C7]best in me she [F]can't see the [Fm]rest of me
Cause she [C]loves me just the [G7]way that I [C]am
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I can bring her red [C7]roses on the [F]nights that she's [Fm]waiting up
To [C]try to make for when [Am]I come home so [G7]late

Makes the [C]roses seem [G7]so out of [C]place [C7]
