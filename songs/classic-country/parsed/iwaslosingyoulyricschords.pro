{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I should have noticed this when
You started turning up in [G7]sad songs
It should have [Dm]hit me when
You [G7]began to sing [C]along
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I should have realized when
There were [G7]tears in your [C]eyes
Every [F]time a [C]song was [Dm]through
It was [C]more than the music
[G7]I was losing [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G7]I should have [C]seen it when
You started watchin' late late [G7]movies
And you'd [Dm]sleep on the couch
Instead of [G7]sleeping next to [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
When I'd wake up in the night
Sometimes [G7]I'd hear you [C]crying 
But [F]baby [C]I never [Dm]knew
[C]It was more than the movies
[G7]I was losing [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I [Dm]wish you had [F]screamed and [G7]yelled out
The things you [C]held deep inside
Cause I never [F]dreamed
That our [D7]love was dyin' [Dm]right before my [G7]eyes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
But I should have [C]felt it 
On those too few nights I [G7]held you
Oh [Dm]I should have known
All those [G7]whispered words weren't [C]true
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
There was a reason why 
You never [G7]looked in my [C]eyes
And it [F]breaks my [C]heart in [Dm]two
When you were [C]makin' love to me
[G7]I was losing [Am]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
[F]When you were [C]makin' love to me
[G7]I was losing [C]you
{end_of_verse}
