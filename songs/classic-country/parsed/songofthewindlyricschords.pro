{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I see the shadows as they come to welcome the [Am]night
[C]Dreading the time when I know [D7]I must turn out the [G]light
Here in the darkness I lie down to hurt once [Am]again
[C]From loving a memory who's [D7]heart sings a song of the [G]wind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
So much like a child yet so very much of a [Am]man
[C]He was a drifter and [D7]I wasn't part of his [G]plan
He needed me when I met him so I took him [Am]in
[C]Not knowing someday he'd [D7]follow the song of the [G]wind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The [C]wind sings a movin' [D7]song 
Of [G]fields that are [C]always [D7]green
And the [C]man who has heard its [Bm]call 
Can't [Am]leave a thing [D7]unseen
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[G]If I should see him and he needs the warmth of a [Am]friend
[C]I'll try to help him [D7]for the short time he will [G]spend
I won't be surprised when I wake and he's gone once [Am]again
For [C]he is a dreamer who [D7]follows the songs of the [G]wind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Yes [C]he is a dreamer who [D7]follows the songs of the [G]wind
{end_of_verse}
