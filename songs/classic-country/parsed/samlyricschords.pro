{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Sam it's been awhile since I've [G7]seen or heard from you
Don't you think that if you tried you could write a line or [C]two
Just [F]few words and a note wouldn't [C]matter what you [Am]wrote
That's [G7]just the way I [F]am I worry [C]Sam[G7]   [F]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]Sam I don't expect for you to [G7]tell me where you've been
But I do expect you back when you're down and need a [C]friend
I [F]love you right even though you're wrong it [C]never ever [Am]fails
That's [G7]just the way I [F]am it’s crazy [C]Sam
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I [F]found nobody [G7]tried to tie you [C]down
So [F]I'll admit I'd [G7]like to be [C]around 
In the [F]nights that were so [G7]cold you [C]were there to [Am]hold
That's [G7]just the way I [F]am I miss you [C]Sam
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Sam it's not a lot you know I [G7]never asked for much
But the least that you could do is write and keep in [C]touch
Just a [F]few words and a note doesn't [C]matter what you [Am]wrote
That's [G7]just the way I [F]am I love you [C]Sam
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
That's [G7]just the way I [F]am I love you [C]Sam [F]   [C]
