{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Your eyes are always filled with sweet temp[C]tation 
And the [G]way you look at me sets me on [D7]fire
When it [G]comes to your lips there’s no hesi[C]tation
I’m like a [G]puppet on a [D7]string filled with [G]desire
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And I’d travel twice the speed of love [C]to get to your charms
I’d [G]walk on by to hold you in my [D7]arms
And I’d travel [G]twice the speed of love [C]never to part
[G]Twice the speed of love to be the [D7]prisoner of your [G]heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I never thought that I could be so [C]lonely
But [G]that’s the way I feel without [D7]you
And [G]every girl I know is like a [C]stranger
Cause [G]they don’t make me [D7]feel the way you [G]do
