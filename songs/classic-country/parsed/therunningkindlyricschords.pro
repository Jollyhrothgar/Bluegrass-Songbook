{meta: title The Running Kind}
{meta: artist Merle Haggard}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I was born the running kind leaving always on my mind
Home was never home to me at [C]anytime
Every front door found me hoping I would find [D7]the back door open
There just had to be an exit for the running [G]kind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Within me there's a prison surrounding me alone
As real as any dungeon with a wall of [C]stone
I know running's not the answer but running's [D7]been my nature
And a part of me that keeps me moving [G]on
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I was born the running kind leaving always on my mind
Home was never home to me at [C]anytime
Every front door found me hoping I would find [D7]the back door open
There just had to be an exit for the running [G]kind
{end_of_verse}
