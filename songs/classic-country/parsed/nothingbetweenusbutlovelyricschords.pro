{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]There’s nothing but a heartbeat [C]between us
I [Am]tremble with the [D7]thought of what’s to [G]come
[C]Satin and [D7]lace and [Bm]soft gentle [Em]breathing 
There’s [Am]nothing [D7]between us but [G]love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh ain’t this magic when [C]our bodies touch
Our [Am]hearts start [D7]beating like [G]one
I [C]thank God for the [D7]miracle of [Bm]moments like [Em]this
When there’s [Am]nothing [D7]between us but [G]love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]Let’s let love [D7]lift us [G]high as it [Em]can
[Am]High as the [D7]heavens [G]above 
And [C]let’s treasure the [D7]feeling of [Bm]being to[E7]gether
When there’s [Am]nothing [D7]between us but [G]love
{end_of_verse}
