{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G7]Then you [C]call me long [F]distance from [C]Memphis
When they said it was [G7]you on the [Am]line
I said [C]don't come [F]tomorrow cause [Am]I won't be [D7]here
You'd [Dm]only be wasting your [G7]time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I've been your [F]long distance [G7]lover [C]for far too long
But I'm [F]not here to [G7]tell you who's [D7]right or who's [G7]wrong
But I [F]know I once loved you but [C]somehow it [A7]seems
That [Dm]it's all a [G7]part of a [C]dream
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G7]So don't [C]call me [F]again in the [C]morning
Cause I won't be [G7]changin' my [Am]mind
And the [C]phone will be [F]ringing in [Am]my empty [D7]room
I [Dm]ain't leavin' nothin' [G7]behind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I've been your [F]long distance [G7]lover [C]for far too long
The [F]nights are so [G7]lonely can't [D7]keep holdin' [G7]on
And the [F]miles are like mountains they [C]hide you from [A7]me
And [Dm]it's all a [G7]part of a [C]dream [G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I've been your [F]long distance [G7]lover [C]for far too long
Can't [F]hold on to [G7]feelings when [D7]you're so long [G7]gone
It all [F]keeps on a changing and [C]now it just [A7]means
That [Dm]it's all a [G7]part of a [C]dream
{end_of_verse}
