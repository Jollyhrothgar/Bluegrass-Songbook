[C]Back home [A7]again in Indiana [D7]and it [G7]seems that I can [C]see
[F]That gleaming candlelight still shining [C]bright
[D7]Through the sycamores for [G7]me
[C]The new mown hay [A7]sends all its [D7]fragrance
[G7]From the fields I used to [Am]roam
[C]When I dream about the [E7]moonlight on the [Am]Wabash
[C]Then I'm longing for my [G7]Indiana [C]home
