[C]One of these days that telephone is gonna [F]ring

Lord I'd [F]borrow beg and [G7]steal to kiss and [C]hold her
All her [F]friends tell me she's [G7]had enough this [C]time

Now I'm [F]crying trying to [G7]get back on her [C]mind

If she calls I know just what I'm gonna [F]say
That I'm [G7]sorry and I'll swear I've changed my [C]ways
And I'll prove it if she'll just give me the [F]time
Time [G7]enough to at least get back on her [C]mind
