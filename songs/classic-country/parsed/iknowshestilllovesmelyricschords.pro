{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}

But it seems more [C7]like a habit than [F]before

{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
She used to laugh at all my jokes
But lately I can't [C7]seem to make her [F]smile

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Cause it's [C7]just a little [F]colder [A]   [F]

From what's left of her de[G7]votion 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
