[C]Your letter came this very [F]day

I've read it [C]o'er a thousand [F]times
Its left me [C]with a [G7]worried [C]mind

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}

{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I dread the thought that we are [F]through
And that you've [C]found somebody [G7]new
I love you [C]now I always [F]will
I'd rather [C]die than say [C][G7]farewell
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I hope and pray before my [F]time
That you'll come [C]back and say you're [G7]mine
Bring back the [C]love you took [F]away
And mend the [C]heart you [G7]broke [C]today
{end_of_verse}

And did you [C]mean to make me [G7]cry
I guess [C]until the day I [F]die
That I will [C]still be [G7]wondering [C]why
