{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Now I'm a guitar picker [G7]musician is my [C]trade
A [F]full-fledged union [C]member [D7]Lord knows where all I've [G7]played
The [C]other day I left my things in the [F]trunk of my old car
Would you believe some dirty [C]dog [G7]stole my steel [C]guitar
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
It's [F]just an old used Sho Bud [C]for which I've saved and scraped
[F]I bought it second handed from a [C]cat who's name was [G7]Drake
[C]I loved it like a woman [F]and I cherished every war
And I'd have killed a man whose [C]sticky hands [G7]clamped on my steel [C]guitar
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I babied every peddle and [G7]polished them each [C]day
[F]For I had the only [C]Sho Bud in [D7]Podunk Io[G7]wa
[C]I was king of all the women [F]they wrote from near and far
But the mail has sure been [C]dropping off since they [G7]stole my steel [C]guitar

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I can sound like Roy Wiggins Don [G7]Helms and Jerry [C]Byrd
I [F]can make it sing [C]forever and [D7]never slur a [G7]word
[C]And when I played like Emmons it [F]nearly caught on fire
And I can't play know hot [C]licks now they [G7]stole my steel [C]guitar
