{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Tonight I hear Hawaiian [D7]Echoes calling [G]me
[D7]Back to that isle of dreams by the silvery [G]sea
[D7]Where someone's waiting softly [G]saying
[D7]Oh south wind hear my plea send my love to [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]And I know that someday I'll go back [G]where
[D7]Blue waves play tag with the [G]shore
[C]Arm and arm neath the palms we'll stroll in the [G]sand
[D7]Just as we did long [G]ago
