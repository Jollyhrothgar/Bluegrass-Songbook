[G]You're here to tell me [C]just how much [G]he loves you

[G]Other girls have [C]been in love with [G]him
And the only chance you'll ever have [D7]is very slim

But he's [G]not [C]and if he [G]were [D7]he'd still love [G]me

He'd [D7]still love me because he remembers [C]the little things I've [G]done
Like [A7]ironing shirts and pressing suits when [D7]he had only one
And [G]knowing this you're still expecting [C]me to set him free
But I [G]won't and if I did [D7]he'd still love [G]me[D7]
