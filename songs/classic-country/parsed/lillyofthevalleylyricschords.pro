{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I grew up in Alabama in [F]a valley I called [C]home
And I learned to love sweet Lilly from the [G7]start
[C]But I had to do my duty yes [F]I had to do my [C]part
But the thought of leaving [G7]Lilly breaks my [C]heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
If this war could just be over [F]and I could go back [C]home
If I could hold and kiss her once [G7]again
[C]Then if I should die tomorrow [F]after loving her [C]tonight
Then I would not feel my [G7]life had been in [C]vain
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Cause she's my Lilly of the valley
And I want her for my [G7]wife
[C]She's my Lilly [C7]of the [F]valley
I guess [C]I've loved Lilly [G7]almost all my [C]life
