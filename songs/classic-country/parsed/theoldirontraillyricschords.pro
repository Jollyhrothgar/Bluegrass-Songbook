{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Well the old iron trail is a [F]railroad track it [C]runs all over our [G7]land
And [C]I had traveled every [F]foot of it [G7]before I was a [C]man
My daddy told me [F]stories he [C]told me some pretty wild [G7]tales
Of [C]long ago when [F]he was a beau and [C]traveled [G7]the old iron [C]trail
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And he said well there ain’t no sofas in a [F]boxcar [C]there ain’t no feather [G7]bed
There [C]ain’t no carpet [F]for your feet [G7]no pillows to lay your [C]head
There ain’t no milk and [F]honey [C]there ain’t no beer and [G7]ale
[C]Life is hell the [F]bread is stale [C]out on the [G7]old iron [C]trail
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well I’m just like my [F]daddy there’s [C]hobo blood in [G7]me
And [C]that old iron trail [F]that he knew so well [G7]soon was a-callin’ [C]me
I traveled all over this [F]country [C]over ever hill and [G7]dale
[C]Riding on an [F]old boxcar I [C]traveled the [G7]old iron [C]trail
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I want’cha to know there ain't no sofas in a [F]boxcar [C]there ain’t no feather [G7]bed
There [C]ain’t no carpet [F]for your feet [G7]no pillows to lay your [C]head
There ain’t no milk and [F]honey [C]there ain’t no beer and [G7]ale
[C]Life is hell the [F]bread is stale [C]out on the [G7]old iron [C]trail
Spoken:
Better listen to me boys it ain’t no life of Riley out there
Stay home never roam I know what I’m talking about
Wished I’d listened to my dad 
He’s a lot smarter than I gave him credit for
