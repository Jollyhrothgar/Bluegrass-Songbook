{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I come from just the other side of nowhere
To this [F]big time lonesome town
They [G7]got a lot of ice and snow here
Ain't [F]half as cold as all the people I've [C]found
Everywhere I try to [C7]go here 
Somebody's [F]always trying bring me down
I've [G7]seen about enough to know where I'll be [C]bound [C7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I've got a [F]mind to see the headlights [G7]shining
On that old white [C]line between my heart and [Am]home
[F]Sick of spending Sundays [G7]wishing they were Mondays 
[C]Sitting in the park [C7]alone give my [F]best to anyone 
Who's [G7]left who ever done me [C]any loving way but [Am]wrong
And [F]tell 'em that the pride of [G]just 
The other side of nowhere's going [G7]home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]Taking nothing back to show there
For these [F]dues that I've paid
But the [G7]soul I almost sold here
And the [F]body I've been giving [C]away
Fading from the neon [C7]nighttime glow here
[F]Heading for the light of day
[G]Just the other side of [G7]nowhere going [C]home  [C7]
