{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I came to town [Am]to search for gold
And I [C]brought with me [G7]a memory
And seem to [Am]hear the night [C]wind cry
Go [Am]hang your dreams on [C]the hanging tree
Your [Am]dreams of love that could [C]never be
Hang your faded [G7]dreams on [C]the hanging tree
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I searched for gold and [Am]I found my gold
And I found [C]a girl who [G7]loved just me
And I [Am]wish that I could love [C]her too
But I [Am]left my heart on [C]the hanging tree
I left [Am]my heart with [C]a memory
And a faded [G7]dream on the [C]hanging tree
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now there were men who [Am]craved my gold
And meant [C]to take [G7]my gold from me
When a [Am]man is gone he [C]needs no gold
So they [Am]carried me to [C]the hanging tree
To join [Am]my dreams and [C]a memory
Yes they carried [G7]me to the [C]hanging tree
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
To really live you [Am]must almost die
And it happened [C]just that [G7]way with me
They [Am]took my gold and [C]set me free
And [Am]I walked away from [C]the hanging tree
I [Am]walked away from [C]the hanging tree
And my own [G7]true love she [C]walked with me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
That’s [F]when I knew that [G7]the hanging tree
Was a [F]tree of life new [C]life for me
A [F]tree of hope new [C]hope for me
A [F]tree of love new [C]love for me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
The hanging tree [F]the hanging tree [C]the hanging tree
{end_of_verse}
