{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[Am]Three thirty [Dm]in the morning not a soul in [F]sight
[E7]The city's looking like a ghost town on a moonless summer [Am]night
Raindrops on the windshield [Dm]there's a storm moving [F]in
[E7]He's headin' back from somewhere that he never should have [Am]been
And the thunder [G]rolls    [E7]and the thunder [Am]rolls
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Every light [Dm]is burning in a house across [F]town
[E7]She's pacin' by telephone in her faded flannel [Am]gown
Asking for a miracle hoping [Dm]she's not [F]right
[E7]Praying it's the weather that's kept him out all [Am]night
And the thunder [G]rolls    [E7]and the thunder [Am]rolls
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The thunder [F]rolls and [G]the lightnin' [Am]strikes
Another love grows [F]cold on [G]a sleepless [E7]night
As the storm blows [F]on [G]out of [Am]control
Deep in her [F]heart [G]the thunder [Am]rolls
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
She's waitin' [Dm]by the window when he pulls into the [F]drive
[E7]She rushes out to hold him thankful he's [Am]alive
But on the wind and [Dm]rain a strange new perfume [F]blows
The [E7]lightnin' flashes in her eyes and he knows that she [Am]knows
And the thunder [G]rolls    [E7]and the thunder [Am]rolls
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The thunder [F]rolls and [G]the lightnin' [Am]strikes
Another love grows [F]cold on [G]a sleepless [E7]night
As the storm blows [F]on [G]out of [Am]control
Deep in her [F]heart [G]the thunder [Am]rolls
