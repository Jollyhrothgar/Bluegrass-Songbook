{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G7]Darling I live for these few minutes I can spend with you
[C]I think just like you do but where’s it leading to

[C]For I’m another man’s woman [G7]and I’m another woman’s [C]man
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G7]You belong to her and you belong to [C]him
[G7]Any plans we ever have must include [C]them

[C]Though I’m another man’s woman [G7]and I’m another woman’s [C]man
