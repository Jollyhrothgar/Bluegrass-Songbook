{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I found you sitting there [D7]about to cry
And so was I she just gave me the [G]news
I could tell that you were [D7]just like me in misery
Two hearts deep in the [G]blues
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And so we sit and talked the [D7]whole night through
And then I knew that I could never [G]refuse
Your heart was aching from a [D7]broken trust
And we were just two hearts deep in the [G]blues
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Do you [C]remember that you told me
All of your [G]love deserted you
Do you [C]remember that I told you
We were [G]both in the same [D7]canoe
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[G]Two broken hearts were somehow [D7]blended then
And mended when we each had nothing to [G]lose
So we took the chance [D7]and aren't glad 
Because we had two hearts deep in the [G]blues
{end_of_verse}
