{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I told my friends I had you charmed 
That you would [G7]never [C]leave my [G]arms
But I was [D7]guilty of dreaming and [C]talking too [G]loud
Your photograph with love to me
I passed [G7]around for [C]all to [G]see
But I was [D7]guilty of dreaming and [C]talking too [G]loud
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[D7]Oh how it hurt me to swallow [G]my foolish pride
[A7]Oh it nearly killed me to tell my [D7]friends I stepped aside
For someone [G]new who won your heart 
While I was [G7]talking [C]big and [G]smart
I was [D7]guilty of dreaming and [C]talking too [G]loud
