{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]You'll [G7]never be the [C]sun turning in the [F]sky
[G7]And you won't be the [C]moon above us on a moonlit [F]night
And [G7]you won't be the [C]stars in heaven although they burn so [F]bright
[G7]But even on the [C]deepest ocean you [F]will be [G7]the [C]light
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You may [G7]not always [C]shine as you go barefoot over [F]stone
[G7]You might be so [C]long together or you might walk [F]alone
And [G7]you won't find that [C]love comes easy but that love is always [F]right
[G7]So even when the [C]dark clouds gather you [F]will be [G7]the [C]light
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And if you lose the [G7]part inside
When [C]loves turns round on you leaving the past [G7]behind
[E7]Is knowing you'll [Am]do like you [E7]always [Am]do 
Holding [D7]you blind keeping you [G7]true
