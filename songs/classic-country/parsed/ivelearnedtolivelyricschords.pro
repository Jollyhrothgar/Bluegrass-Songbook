{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Like a [D7]child lost in the [G]wilderness [D7]I knew not where to go
Surrounded by the [Em]emptiness of a [C]love that left me cold
I [Am]stumbled through the darkness of [D7]nights that have no stars
And [Am]days that have no sunshine to [D7]warm my broken [G]heart[D7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Like a [G]bird in flight brought down by stones 
From an [D7]unknown assailant's sling
A [G]stranger took you [D7]from my arms and [C]I lost everything
In [Am]days to come I nearly ran out of [D7]ways to stay alive
But [Am]through it all I never lost the [D7]will to sur[G]vive[D7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And I'm not [Em]over you and I [C]doubt that I'll [G]ever be[D7]
But I've [Em]learned to live and [C]you won't be the [G]death of me oh [D7]no
Yes I've [Em]learned to live [C]and I'm doing well but I'm not [G]over you [D7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Like a [G]thief who takes just what he needs and [D7]leaves the rest behind
You [G]took the heart right [D7]out of me and [C]left me with my mind
And [Am]I almost went out of it at [D7]times believed I did
But [Am]gradually I learned you're someone [D7]I'll have to live [G]with[D7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Cause I'm not [Em]over you and I [C]doubt that I'll [G]ever be[D7]
But I've [Em]learned to live and [C]you won't be the [G]death of me oh [D7]no
Yes I've [Em]learned to live [C]and I'm doing well but I'm not [G]over you
{end_of_verse}
