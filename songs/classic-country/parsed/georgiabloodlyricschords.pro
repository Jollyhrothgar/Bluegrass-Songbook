{meta: title Georgia Blood}
{meta: artist Marty Robbins}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I step across the railroad track 
Climb a fence and walk out through a [F]field
And for a while I breath [G7]fresh air 
And feel that sun I can't believe it's [C]real
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
For eighteen months I've been locked up
Iron bars is all that I could [F]see
I ran away [G7]from prison 
I've been in the Nashville [C]penitentiary
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I came up here from [F]Georgia 
Everyone said I had talent I could [C]write  
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Nashville's where the money is
They all said my songs are out of [G7]sight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
So I caught a bus in [C]Waycross 
I enjoyed the ride a quiet winter [F]night
Head straight to 16th avenue [G7]to show 
The kind of songs that I could [C]write
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Well the first door that I opened
Was a wrong one and it's kinda like a [F]dream
I met a music man [G7]that shook my hand
And said we both make quite a [C]team
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
He handed me a contract
With a lot of words I didn't [F]understand
But he told me not [G7]to worry
I could trust him cause he was an honest [C]man
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
He told me I should [F]get a job
So I hired on in a restaurant here in [C]town
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 9}
Wasn’t very long till I heard
Some of my songs being played [G7]around
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 10}
But he told me they weren’t [C]selling
Though a ballad I wrote went to number [F]one
He said keep on writing [G7]keep your job
And bring me songs that you have [C]done
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 11}
I kept my job kept writing
Cause I really thought I’d find that pot of [F]gold
But the story that [G7]I’m telling
Is a story that’s been told and [C]retold
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 12}
He said he spent the money
I had made from promoting songs he really [F]tried
It got so I could [G7]never see him
When he saw me coming he would [C]hide
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 13}
I waited for my money why [F]it never came
I couldn’t [C]understand
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 14}
Till one day I saw him in a car
That must have cost at least ten [G7]grand
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 15}
Then finally I caught [C]him
And he said I’m sorry kid you’ve had bad [F]luck
He said go back [G7]to Georgia
Then he laughed and handed me a hundred [C]bucks
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 16}
I took the hundred dollars
And in a flash a thought was burning in my [F]mind
I had a big [G7]surprise for him
And he’d regret he stole songs that were [C]mine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 17}
My temper flared and I told myself
An hour from now he wouldn’t be [F]alive
Then I ran to a pawn [G7]shop 
Where I bought an automatic [C]forty-five
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 18}
My temper got the best [F]of me
For a while there was no guiding [C]star
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 19}
There was no one to talk to
So I walked back and I waited by his [G7]car
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 20}
It wasn’t very long until [C]I saw 
Him walking to the parking [F]lot
Then I stepped out beside him [G7]and I said 
Would you look here see what I’ve [C]got
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 21}
His face was white as powder
And he dropped the cigarette he tried to [F]light
He said don’t pull [G7]that trigger 
Lord have mercy please don’t kill me here [C]tonight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 22}
I’ll give you all your money
If you’ll wait until tomorrow then you’ll [F]see
But a Georgia boy don’t [G7]like a thief
There was too much Georgia blood in [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 23}
So I pulled the [F]trigger 
And the bullet hit him squarely in the [C]chest
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 24}
Then I shot him one more time
For every button sewed upon his [G7]vest
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 25}
It was then and only then [C]I realized
The awful wrong that I had [F]done
In disbelief I stood there [G7]until somebody 
Walked up and they took the [C]gun
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 26}
I wish I’d never [F]wrote a song
Or ever heard of Nashville [C]Tennessee
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 27}
I wish that I were home in Georgia
But I guess that I will never [G7]be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 28}
I wish I could [C]stay here 
In this field so fresh and [F]green
But better yet I wish [G7]that I could 
Wake and find this just a [C]dream
{end_of_verse}
