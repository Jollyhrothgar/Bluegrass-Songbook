{meta: artist (the Corvette Song)}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I stopped off at the Quicksack for some beer and [G][C]cigarettes
This [C]old man took my [G]money as he stared at my [D7]Corvette
He [G]said I had one just like her son in [C]1963
Till the [G]man down at the [D7]bank took her from [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh she was hotter than a two dollar pistol
She was the [C]fastest thing [G]around
[C]Long and lean every young man's [G]dream 
She turned every head in [D7]town
She was built and fun to handle [G]son
I'm glad that you walked [C]in
She reminds me of the [G]one I [D7]loved back [G]then
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well I handed him my keys and said here [C]take her for a [G]spin
The [C]old man scratched his [G]head then he looked at me and [D7]grinned
He said [G]son you just don't understand it ain't the car I [C]want
It's the brunette in your [G]Vette that [D7]turns me [G]on
