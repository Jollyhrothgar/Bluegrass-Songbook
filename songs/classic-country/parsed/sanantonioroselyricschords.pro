{meta: artist Bob Wills}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Deep within my [C7]heart lies a [D7][F]mel-ody
A [G7]song of old San [C]Antone
Where in dreams I [C7]live with a [D7][F]mem-ory 
[G7]Beneath the stars all [C]alone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
It was there I [C7]found [F]beside the [D7]Alamo
[G7]Enchantment strange as the blue up [C]above
A moonlit [C7]pass that [F]only she would [D7]know
Still [G7]hears my broken song of [C]love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G7]Moon in all your splendor  know only my  [D7]heart
Call back my  Rose  Rose of San [G7]Antone
Lips so sweet and tender like [D7]petals falling apart
Speak once  again of my [G]love my [G7]own
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]Broken song [C7]empty [F]words I [D7]know 
Still [G7]live in my heart all [C]alone
For that moonlit pass [C7]by the [D7][F]Ala-mo  
And [G7]Rose my Rose of San [C]Antone
{end_of_verse}
