{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Her hands are burned from the [C]torch that she [Am]carries
Her [D7]closets are full of old dreams she can't [G]wear
I sit beside her but it's [C]you on her [Am]mind
It's a [D7]party you're giving but I buy the [G]wine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
She'll dance with me but it's [C]you that she's [Am]holding
And [D7]she does her best to hide it from [G]me
But I've always known she [C]can leave me [Am]behind
[D7]She brings the memories and I buy the [G]wine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I buy the wine that makes her [C]unwind
[D7]Makes her forget about [G]you
Then in the darkness with our [C]bodies en[Am]twined
[G]She cries out a [D7]name but Lord it's not [G]mine
{end_of_verse}
