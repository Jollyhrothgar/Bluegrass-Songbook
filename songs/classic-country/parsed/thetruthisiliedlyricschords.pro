{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I said it was over [F]I said we were [C]through
I said when I [Am]left I was [Dm]done loving [G7]you
But I'm [C]fighting a feelin' that [F]can't be de[C]nied
So forget what I [Am]told you the [G7]truth is I [C]lied

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I know you weren't expectin' [F]this visit from [C]me
With my hat in my [Am]hand and my [Dm]heart on my [G7]sleeve
I've [C]stopped my pretendin' and I've [F]swallowed my [C]pride
I came here to [Am]tell ya the [G7]truth is I [C]lied
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The [F]truth is I'm just not as [C]strong as I thought 
This [Am]battle is harder than any [G7]war that we've fought
I [F]said I could just push your [C]memory [Am]aside
And I [C]meant when I [Am]said it but the [G7]truth is I [C]lied
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Is it [A]asking too [F]much to for[C]get and forgive
[A]Dying for your love is [G7]no way to live
And the [F]truth is I'm just not as [C]strong as I thought
This [Am]battle is harder than any [G7]war that we've fought
I [F]said I could just push your [C]memory [Am]aside
And I [C]meant it when I [Am]said it but the [G7]truth is I [C]lied
{end_of_verse}

Oh I meant it when I [Am]said it but the [G7]truth is I [C]lied
