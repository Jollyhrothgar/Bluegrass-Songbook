{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Every night I go out somebody asks [D7]me 
Whatever happened to [G]you
I just say that I haven't seen you [D7]lately 
And then I say my friend I thought you [G]knew
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
That we split the blanket down the [D7]middle 
Cause we could never get [G]along
We split the blanket down the [D7]middle 
That's all you can do when love is [G]gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well I tell 'em that we tried and tried to make [D7]it
But we couldn't solve what was the [G]use
To hang on to love it's only [D7]misery 
So now I'm fancy free and foot [G]loose
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
That we split the blanket down the [D7]middle 
Cause we could never get [G]along
We split the blanket down the [D7]middle 
That's all you can do when love is [G]gone
