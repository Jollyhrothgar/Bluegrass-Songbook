{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]We moved on the second floor of a [F]grocery [C]store [F]garage
[G7]Room and board and gasoline livin’ on the [C]job
Our backyard is asphalt with [F]parking meter trees
And [G7]there ain’t no peace and quiet there ‘til all the people [C]leave
But she got tired of working hard and [F]running [C]low on [F]luck
She [G7]loaded up her dreams and left in my ol’ pick-up [C]truck
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh the weeds outlived the roses in [F]her ol’ flower pot
And [G7]all I’ve got is a greasy spot in an empty parking [C]lot
We spent a lot of time out there [F]when the day would end
And [G7]Lord I’d love to see her now and my ol’ truck pull [C]in
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well I’d like to have the gasoline I’ve [F]run out on the ground
Too [G7]busy missing both of them to cut the nozzle [C]down
Everywhere from anywhere in a [F]fifty dollar truck
I [G7]hope that them ol’ booty tires and taped-up wires hold [C]up
{end_of_verse}
