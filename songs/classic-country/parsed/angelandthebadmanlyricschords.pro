{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]There was a man whose deeds were dark as night
And quite by chance he rode into the [A7]light
A [C]man wild as the [G]dust devil with no [C]place to [G]run
[A7]Livin' by his wits and by his [D7]gun
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
He [G]met a girl like none he had ever known
She cared not for the wild oats he had [A7]sown
And [C]so he laid his [G]gun down and [C]set his spirit [G]free
Began [A7]livin' in respectabili[D7]ty
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
But [G]his ole ways of thinkin' wouldn't die
Could not forget the ole creed he lived [A7]by
And the [C]good and bad and [G]right and wrong 
Kept [C]fightin' for his [G]soul
Till his [A7]heart and mind [D7]both went out of [G]control
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
But now the ole saloon had lost its spell
What once was laughter now was livin' [A7]hell
And the [C]hookers guns and [G]drinkin' 
In his [C]life were out of [G]place
And [A7]in his mind he saw an angel's [D7]face
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
So [G]he burned all his bridges in a day
And the devil deeds were done and laid [A7]away
And he [C]rode out a [G]better man than [C]when he first rode [G]in
And the [A7]angel got the [D7]badman in the [G]end
{end_of_verse}
