{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]While she lays sleeping
I stay out late at [G7]night and play my [C]songs
And [Am]sometimes all the [D7]nights can be so [Bm]long
And it's [Em]good when I finally make it [Am]home  all [D7]alone
While she lays [G]dreaming
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I try to get [G7]undressed without the [C]light
Then [Am]quietly she [D7]says how was your [Bm]night
And I [Em]come to her and say it was all [Am]right 
And I [D7]hold her [G]tight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And she believes in me
I'll never know just what she [F#m]sees in me
I [B7]told her someday if she [Em]was my girl
I could change the world with my [Am]little songs I was [D7]wrong
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
But she has [G]faith in me and so I go on trying [F#m]faithfully
[B7]And who knows maybe on some [Em]special night
If my song is right I can [Am]find a way [D7]while she [G]sleeps 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I stumble to the [G7]kitchen for a [C]bite
Then I [Am]see my old [D7]guitar in the [Bm]night
Just [Em]waiting for me like a secret [Am]friend
And there's no [D7]end while she lays [G]crying
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
I fumble with a [G7]melody or [C]two
Then I'm [Am]torn between the [D7]things that I should [Bm]do
Then she [Em]says to wake her up when I am [Am]through God her love is [D7]true [G]
{end_of_verse}
