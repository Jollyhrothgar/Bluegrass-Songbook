{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Well I don't know why you left me
But [F]I do know that you're [C]gone
Colder nights you've turned my life into a sad old [G7]song
And one [C]way or another I gotta get me over [F]you
And [C]I think there's only one thing [G7]left for me to [C]do
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Lord I don't wanna die of a broken [F]heart
That would [C]be too sad or drive my car off a [F]cliff
You [C]see that would just hurt too [G7]bad
And if I tied a rope around [C]my neck
I couldn't get my [F]breath
So [C]I think I'll just honky tonk [G7]myself to [C]death
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well I might get a little bit crazy
But [F]I don't wanna go [C]insane
Young Wendy and Dan's old whiskey well it might just kill the [G7]pain
I'm [C]gonna find the highest barstool and I'll climb up to the [F]top
Yeah [C]I think I'll just drink and [G7]two-step till I [C]drop
