{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]A little girl prayed at the [C]close of the [G]day 
Cause her daddy had gone far [D7]away
[G]On her little face was a [C]look of [G]despair
I stood there and listened and I heard [D7]this [G]prayer
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
My [C]mommy says daddy has brought us to [G]shame
And [C]I'm never no more to [G]mention his [D7]name
[G]Lord take me and lead me and [C]hold to my [G]hand
Oh heavenly Father [D7]help me [G]understand
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Spoken:
You know friends I wonder
Just how many homes are broken tonight
And just how many tears are shed
By some little word of anger
That never should have been said
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I'd like to tell you a story
Of a family I once knew
We'll call them Mary and William
And their little daughter Sue
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Now Mary was just a plain mother
And Bill was just a usual dad
And they had their little family quarrels
Like everybody else
But neither one really got mad
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Then one day something happened
It was nothing of course
But one word led to another
And the last word led to a divorce
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Now here were two grown up people
Who failed to use common sense
They strengthened their own selfish pride
At little Sue's expense
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
You know she didn’t ask to be brought to this world
To drift from pillar to post
But a divorce never stops to consider
The ones it hurts the most
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 9}
There’d be a lot more honest loving
In this wicked ole world today
If just a few parted parents
Could hear little Sue say
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 10}
[G]Take me and lead me and [C]hold to my [G]hand
Oh heavenly Father [D7]help me [G]understand
{end_of_verse}
