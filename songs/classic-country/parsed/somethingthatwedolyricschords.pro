[G]I remember well the day we wed I can see that [C]picture in my [G]head
I still [C]believe the [G]words we said [Am]forever will ring [D7]true

[C]We help to make each other [G]all that we can be

It [G]gives me heart remembering how we [C]started with a [G]simple vow

We're [G]on a road that [D7]has no [G]end and [C]each day we [G]begin again
Love's [C]not just something [G]that we're in it's [Am]something [D7]that we [G]do
