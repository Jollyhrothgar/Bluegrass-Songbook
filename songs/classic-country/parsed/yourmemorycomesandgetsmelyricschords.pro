{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]You've got power over me that [C]I just can't under[G]stand
The good in you is gone and the devil has [D7]command
[G]I'd leave but I can't stay so [C]what good would it [G]do
When your memory comes and gets me and [D7]leads me back to [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I just don't understand why [C]I love you like I [G]do
My heart keeps searching for just a spark of good in [D7]you
[G]You've got such a hold on me every [C]time I think I'm [G]free
Your memory comes and gets me and [D7]leads me back to [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Every [C]time I find the strength to [G]pull myself away
Every time I've got the nerve to say we're [D7]through
[G]You let me play awhile then [C]like a wayward [G]child
Your memory comes and gets me and [D7]leads me back to [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Yes you let me play awhile then [C]like a wayward [G]child
Your memory comes and gets me and [D7]leads me back to [G]you
{end_of_verse}
