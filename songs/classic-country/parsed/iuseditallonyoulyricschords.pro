[C]Lord there's [F]just no love to [G7]give her [F]I used it [G7]all on [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
She's an angel and she could fill  [F]any man's [D7]dream
I do [F]nothing to [G7]deserve her yet she [F]treats me like a [C]king
She worships me all she wants  [F]is my love [D7]too
But there's [F]just no love to [G7]give her  [F]I used it [G7]all on [C]you

When she turns to me it breaks what's left  [F]of my [D7]heart
She's do [F]anything if [G7]I'd love her but there's [F]nowhere for her to [C]start
She holds me just the way  [F]I wanted you [D7]to

[F]Each time I [G7]try to [C]love her [F]I feel [G7]so a[C]shamed
Cause [F]there's no love [G7]only kind[C]ness and [D7]that's just not the [G7]same
I've [C]even learned to hate you  but [F]what good did it [D7]do
For [F]there's still no love to [G7]give her  [F]I used it [G7]all on [C]you
[F]There's just no love to [G7]give her  [F]I used it [G7]all on [C]you
{end_of_verse}
