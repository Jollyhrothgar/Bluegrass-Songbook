{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]When I think about the time that I sat [F]crying in my beer
[C]Jukebox pounding [F]misery from ear to ear
I [C]know I'd tell myself I'm better [F]off without you here
But I'm [C]looking [Am]for beginnings when the [Dm]end is always [G7]near
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
She's [F]leavin' in the morning sing a [C]sad song for me
[F]Keeping me in the dark don't know [C]how long it will be
But I've [F]heard that tune before she says she's [C]gotta [G7]be [Am]free
But I [Dm]know that's not true and that's [G7]what's bothering [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Anywhere you look it's every[F]where and all around
[C]It's the blues they keep singing lord 
And it's [F]bound to get you down
But the [C]melody can move you in a [F]way to ease the pain
And it [C]won't be [Am]long before you're [Dm]on your feet [G7]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I'd [F]be alright if she'd just [G7]make up her mind
[F]I don't know why but I forgive her [G7]time after time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
She's [F]leavin' in the morning sing a [C]sad song for me
[F]Keeping me in the dark don't know [C]how long it will be
But I've [F]heard that tune before she says she's [C]gotta [G7]be [Am]free
But I [Dm]know that's not true and that's [G7]what's bothering [C]me
