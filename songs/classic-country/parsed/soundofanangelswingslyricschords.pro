{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Jenny was the girl that I [F]once called my [C]own
Then came the day my [F]Jenny left me all [C]alone
She [F]died neath the wheels of a midnight [C]train
[F]Trying to find the [C]high school [Am]r-ing
And [C]that's when I first heard the [F]sound of an [G7]angel's [C]wings
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh how my poor heart [F]cried the day they took her [C]away
And then something deep [F]inside me seemed to [C]say
[F]Goodbye my love remember [C]me
[F]I'll wait for you in [Am][C]eternity
But [C]again I heard the [F]sound of an [G7]angel's [C]wings
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I ran down to the [F]sea so deep and [C]wide
I just had to be by my [F]darling Jenny's [C]side
[F]And I cried oh Jenny please wait for [C]me
[F]I’ll soon be with you in [Am][C]eternity 
And [C]again I heard the [F]sound of an [G7]angel's [C]wings
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[F]And I cried oh Jenny please wait for [C]me
[F]I’ll soon be with you in [Am][C]eternity 
And the [C]last thing I heard was the [F]sound of an [G7]angel's [C]wings
And the last thing I heard was the [F]sound of an [G7]angel's [C]wings
{end_of_verse}
