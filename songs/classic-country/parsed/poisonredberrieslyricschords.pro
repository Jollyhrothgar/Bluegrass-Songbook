[C]You know I don't think much [F]about her no [C]more
Seldom if [Am]e-ver [D7]does she cross my [G7]mind

Like the poison red [Am]berries to [G7]die on the [C]vine

This morning at dawn Lord I [F]pulled into [C]town
Had some coffee and [Am]talked with some [D7]old friends of [G7]mine
[C]Laughing at the [C7]good times [F]they all [C]remembered
And then I [Am]remembered the [G7]time

[C]Oh Lord I can see the [F]bright lights back in [C]Dallas
As yesterday [Am]moves like a [D7]dream through my [G7]mind

And you know it [Am]took such a long [G7]time

Seldom if [Am]e-ver [D7]does she cross my [G7]mind

Like the poison red [Am]berries that [G7]clings to the [C]mind
