{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]You're the last one I think of when I [F]lay down to [C]sleep
You're the first one I dream of every [G7]morning
And it [C]wouldn't be too hard for you to [F]make my life [C]complete
Can't you see it was meant to be you're the only one for me
So [G7]why can't I be your one and [C]only
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
It's no wonder you can't see me
Follow Johnny one time hanging [G7]round
I was [C]steady as the [F]Rock of [C]Gibraltar 
Stand by me and you'll [G7]walk on solid [C]ground

That's why I keep my [G7]feelings strong for [C]you
