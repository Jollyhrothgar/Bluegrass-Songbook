{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Oscar was an angel and he [C]used to [G]walk the [C]streets
Shoutin' out some [G]prophesies at [F]everyone he'd [D7]meet
He was a [G]local fixture like a [C]cop out [G]on a [C]beat
Folks said he'd been [G]shell shocked long [D7]ago
And more than [C]that for no [G]one seemed to [D7]know
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G]Oscar was a walker at least [C]four miles [G]twice a [C]day
The entire length of [G]Main Street he'd be [F]shoutin' all the [D7]way
And I [G]had no idea where he [C]heard the [G]things he'd [C]say
But he was not your [G]normal voice of [D7]doom
It was a [C]happy song sung [G]slightly out of [D7]tune
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And he'd [C]say everyone will [D7]die and go to [G]heaven
And [C]we will all be [D7]angels some[C]day[G]
And what [C]you are in this [D7]world don't count for [G]nothin'
Cause [C]we are only [G]children we're just [F]lost along the [D7]way
But [C]we will [D7]all be angels [C]some[G]day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Well I worked at the Rialto I [C]sold tickets [G]at the [C]door
And Oscar he'd come [G]by most every[F]day bout half past [D7]four
And he'd [G]pay to see some movie that he'd [C]seen ten [G]times be[C]fore
But mostly we'd just [G]let him in for [D7]free
Then he'd watch five [C]minutes then he'd [G]come and talk to [D7]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And he'd [C]say everyone will [D7]die and go to [G]heaven
And [C]we will all be [D7]angels some[C]day[G]
And what [C]you are in this [D7]world don't count for [G]nothin'
Cause [C]we are only [G]children we're just [F]lost along the [D7]way
But [C]we will [D7]all be angels [C]some[G]day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Well it's going on ten years now since [C]I left [G]my home[C]town
And I went back last [G]summer for a [F]week I hung [D7]around
I [G]looked out for Oscar he was [C]nowhere [G]to be [C]found
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
And someone said they [G]finally had to [D7]commit him
And he [C]died before [G]they had time to [D7]forget him
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Now I'm [G]not about to argue Oscar's [C]train had [G]jumped the [C]track
But I'll bet my last [G]dollar on the [F]plain and simple [D7]fact
[G]Oscar never said a word about [C]me be[G]hind my [C]back
And the way that I was [G]raised to under[D7]stand
Well [C]that bone it [G]makes him the better [D7]man
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And he'd [C]say everyone will [D7]die and go to [G]heaven
And [C]we will all be [D7]angels some[C]day[G]
And what [C]you are in this [D7]world don't count for [G]nothin'
Cause [C]we are only [G]children we're just [F]lost along the [D7]way
But [C]we will [D7]all be angels [C]some[G]day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Well I worked at the Rialto I [C]sold tickets [G]at the [C]door
And Oscar he'd come [G]by most every[F]day bout half past [D7]four

Then he'd watch five [C]minutes then he'd [G]come and talk to [D7]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
Yeah [C]we will [D7]all be angels [C]some[G]day
{end_of_verse}
