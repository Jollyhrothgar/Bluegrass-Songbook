{meta: title Midnight On The Stormy Deep}
{meta: artist Bill Monroe}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Was midnight on the [G7]stormy [C]deep
My solitary watch I ke-[C7]ep
And to think of [F]her I left be[C]hind
And asked if [G7]she'd be true and [C]kind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I never shall [G7]forget the [C]day
When I was forced to go aw-[C7]ay
In silence [F]there my head she'd [C]rest
And pressed me [G7]to her loving [C]breast
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Oh Willie don't [G7]go back to [C]sea
There's other girls as good as m-[C7]e
But none can [F]love you true as [C]I
Pray don't go [G7]where the bullets [C]fly
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
The deep deep sea [G7]may us di[C]vide
And I may be some other's bri-[C7]de
But still my [F]thoughts will sometimes [C]stray
To thee when [G7]thou art far [C]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I never have [G7]proved false to [C]thee
The heart I gave was true as th-i[C7]ne
But you have [F]proved untrue to [C]me
I can no [G7]longer call thee [C]mine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Then fare thee well [G7]I'd rather [C]make
My home upon some icy la-[C7]ke
Where the southern [F]sun refuse to [C]shine
Than to trust a [G7]love so false as [C]thine 
{end_of_verse}
