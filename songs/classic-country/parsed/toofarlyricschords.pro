{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G7]I gave you [C]everything I thought 
I'd [A#7]wear your ring some[F]day on my [C]finger
In love so blind I stepped [A#7]across the line 
Now just [F]memories of you [C]linger
Just like a child I [C7]wished upon a [F]star[Fm]
Sometimes a [C]girl in [G7]love will go too [C]far [G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I was a [C]crazy fool let my [A#7]heart overrule
Each [F]decision my mind was [C]makin'
The harm is done there is no [A#7]place to run
You can't [F]give me back what you've [C]taken
I gave my [C]all now I [C7]don't know where you [F]are[Fm]
Sometimes a [C]girl in [G7]love will go too [C]far [C7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Too [F]far [Fm]oh yes too [C]far 
Sometimes a [G7]girl in love will go too [C]far [G7]
But I [C]know I would smile for in a [A#7]little while 
I'll be [F]holdin' somebody [C]new
A little girl a tiny [A#7]baby girl and I [F]know she will look like [C]you
And she'll be loved just the [C7]same way that you [F]are[Fm]
Sometimes a [C]girl in [G7]love will go too [C]far [A#7]    [C]
{end_of_verse}
