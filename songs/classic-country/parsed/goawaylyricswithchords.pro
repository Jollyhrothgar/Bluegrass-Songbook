{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Go away can't you see I'm [G7]crying
Go [F]back to the [G7]new love you have [C]found
Don't sweet talk me cause I'm not [G7]listening
And [F]you'll only make [G7]things worse by hanging [C]round
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I know that I'd be crazy if I took you back [F]again
But [D7]this foolish heart of mine might just weaken and give [G7]in
So [C]go away I feel much safer [C7]when you're [F]gone
Cause [G7]you're the one who [C]made me cry now let [F]me cry [C][G7]alone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I know that I'd be crazy if I took you back [F]again
But [D7]this foolish heart of mine might just weaken and give [G7]in

Cause [G7]you're the one who [C]made me cry now let [F]me cry [C][G7]alone
