[G]Darling we've come a [C]long way to[G]gether
And when I needed strength you were always by my [D7]side
And through it [G]all our love just [C]keeps on growing [G]stronger
And [C]wouldn't you [G]say our love's the [C]tried and [D7]tested [G]kind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Our [D7]love's been tested many times [C]without [G]success
It's been tried every way but we were [D7]blessed
Yes we've [C]had our ups and downs but no [G]hills we couldn't climb
And [C]wouldn't you [G]say our love's the [C]tried and [D7]tested [G]kind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Darling sometimes I have to [C]wonder how we [G]ever made it through
Then I have to stop and [C]thank the Lord I [G]found the woman like [D7]you
You're my [G]strength and inspi[C]ration and I'm [G]so glad that you're mine
And [C]wouldn't you [G]say our love's the [C]tried and [D7]tested [G]kind
And [C]wouldn't you [G]say our love's the [C]tried and [D7]tested [G]kind
{end_of_verse}
