{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I seem to see a shadow of heartaches and [G7]despair
I seem to hear your footsteps [F]though I know they aren't [C]there
Everything seems just the same [C7]except that you are [F]gone
As I [G7]walk again all by myself down lover's lane [C]alone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I hear the laughter in your voice a thing that will not [G7]die
And I see the teardrops in your [F]eyes from times I made you [C]cry
It's hard to realize that [C7]all these things are [F]gone
As I [G7]walk again all by myself down lover's lane [C]alone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G7]Perhaps someday as [C]time goes by I'll [G7]love again and [C]yet
[D7]There are some things and it takes more than a lifetime to [G7]forget
You [C]brought me laughter love and joy [C7]now all these things are [F]gone
As [G7]I walk again all by myself down lover's lane [C]alone 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
And [G7]yet they tell me [C]someday I will [G7]find myself [C]again
[D7]That God above will call me from this world of appalling [G7]sin
That [C]I will find true happiness and [C7]love I've never [F]known
And [G7]never have to walk again down lover's lane [C]alone
{end_of_verse}
