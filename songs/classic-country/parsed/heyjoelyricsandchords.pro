{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Hey Joe where'd you find that pearly-girly
Where'd you get that jolly-dolly
How'd you rate that dish I wish was [G7]mine
Hey Joe she's got skin that's creamy-dreamy
Eyes that look so lovey-dovey
Lips as red as cherry-berry [C]wine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Now listen [F]Joe I ain't no heel
But old buddy let me [C]tell you how I [F]feel
She's a honey she's a sugar-pie
I'm warning you I'm gonna try to [G7]steal her from you
[C]Hey Joe though we've been the best of friends
[F]This is where our friendship ends
I [G7]gotta have that dolly for my [C]own
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Hey Joe come on let's be buddy-duddy
Show me you're my palsy-walsy
Introduce that pretty little chick to [G7]me
Hey Joe quit that waiting hesitating
Let me at her what's the matter
You're as slow as any Joe can [C]be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Now come on [F]Joe let's make a deal
Let me dance with her to [C]see if she is [F]real
She's the cutest girl I've ever seen
I'll tell you face to face I mean to [G7]steal her from you
[C]Hey Joe now we'll be friends till the end
[F]This looks like the end my friend
I [G7]gotta have that dolly for my [C]own
{end_of_verse}
