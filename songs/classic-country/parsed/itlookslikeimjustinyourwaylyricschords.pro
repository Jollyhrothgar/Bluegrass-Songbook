[C]The way that we live has no [G7]meaning

[C]You show me my fault everyday
[F]But you took my name knowing I could never [C]change
[G7]Now it looks like I'm just in your [C]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G7]I'm never alone yet I'm lonesome
[C]For love that you've taken away
[F]We're never apart yet I'm second in your [C]heart
[G7]And it looks like I'm just in your [C]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[G7]If what you have found makes you happy
[C]Then I see no reason to stay
