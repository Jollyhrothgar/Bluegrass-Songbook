[G]I don't know why I [C]keep on [D7]believing you [C]need me
When you [D7]prove so many times that it ain't true
And I can't [G]find one good [C]reason [D7]for staying
[C]Maybe my [D7]leaving would be the best for you

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But [G]these rose [C]colored [D7]glasses 
That [G]I'm [C]looking [D7]through
[G]Show [C]on-ly the [D7]beauty 
Cause they [G]hide [C]all [D7]the truth
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And they [G]let me hold [C]on to the good [D7]times the good [C]lines
The [D7]ones I used to hear when I held you
And they [G]keep me from [C]feeling [D7]so cheated     
[C]Defeated when [D7]reflections in your eyes show me a fool

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
So I [G]just keep on [C]hoping [D7]believing that [C]maybe

You'll [G]believe me when [C]I [D7]say I love you 
And [C]I'll lay these [D7]rose colored glasses [G]aside
