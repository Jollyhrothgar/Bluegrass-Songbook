[C]Here I lay upon my dying [G7]pillow

As death’s cold shadow hovers o’er [G7]me
To all [F]sinners I [G7]plead with my last [C]breath

And [C]tonight I’m [G7]dying a sinner’s [C]death

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
No one knows until he has to face [G7]it
Just how [F]bad a [G7]sinner there can [C]be
I’m facing it now as I live [F]over
All those [C]things that I [G7]allowed to master [C]me
{end_of_verse}

I’m ashamed of things that have passed o’er [G7]me
As I [F]lay here [G7]hoping for the [C]best
When you look upon my face please have [F]pity
For a [C]worried [G7]soul could never [C]rest
