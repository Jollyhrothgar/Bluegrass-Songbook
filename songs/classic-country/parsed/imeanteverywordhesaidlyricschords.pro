{meta: title I Meant Every Word He Said}
{meta: artist Ricky Van Shelton}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I heard him say I love you I heard him say [G7]forever
Without you he'd rather be [C]dead
I felt my hand shaking I felt my heart [G7]breaking
Cause I meant every word he [C]said
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I saw him whisper something then I saw you look so [G7]happy
It's a look I won't ever [C]forget 
Cause whatever he told you meant I'd never hold [G7]you
And I meant every word he [C]said
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
His [C7]heart stole those words from my [F]head
Now it's too [D7]late to tell you what he's already [G7]said
I [C]heard him say I love you I heard [G7]him say forever
Then he said with this ring I thee [C]wed 
And when he said I do I choked back I do [G7]too
And I meant every word he [C]said
{end_of_verse}
