[C]The little waitress wore an artificial rose
I met her in a truck stop long [G7]ago
She brought my [C]coffee with a [C7]smile and then sat [F]down
And we [C]started talkin' [G7]bout my wanderin' [C]round
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I recall the night I gave her that red rose
Just a little joke between us I [G7]suppose
But she [C]laughed and tucked it [C7]in her golden [F]hair
And from [C]that day on she [G7]always wore it [C]there
[F]Never blooms [C]never grows [G7]artificial [C]rose

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
As time went out I got to know her well
Grew to love her but I knew I couldn't [G7]tell
About the [C]other woman [C7]farther down the [F]line

[F]Never blooms [C]never grows [G7]artificial [C]rose

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
One night when I had traveled many miles
I pulled in and thought I'd see her loving [G7]smile
But she [C]only left a [C7]package tied in [F]red
And [C]inside a little tear [G7]stained note that [C]read

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
She said I've found out now I return to you
This rose that I've been wearin' like a [G7]fool
May your [C]life be cold [C7]and lonely as can [F]be
Like this [C]artificial [G7]rose you gave to [C]me
[F]Never blooms [C]never grows [G7]artificial [C][F]r-ose
