[C]When you wake up in the morning and you [F]wonder
Why no [C]one's beside you where I usually [Am]lay

For there was [C]nothing that I wouldn't [Am]do
No matter the [C]cost  I [Am]was ready to [C]pay
Now you say I'm only holding you [F]down
Like some old [C]rock you've been dragging [F]around
Yes I'm just your old rock (just your old [C]rock)
But [G7]now I'm rolling [C]away

I'm rolling away  on [C7]a downhill [F]grade
But I'm [C]gonna come to rest side a mountain of love [G7]someday

But even the [C]rock (even the rock) will go a [G7]rolling [C]away
