{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I know that sitting on this stool and [F]drinking like I do
[G7]Won't mend this broken heart of mine the way I'd like it [C]to
It won't make me forget your name or [F]keep you from my thoughts
It [G7]hasn't drowned your memory yet but it sure helps a [C]lot
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [F]thought I might forget you in [C]another woman's arms
[F]But all it did was cause me to [C]remember all your [G7]charm
So [C]here I am at this old bar [F]drinking all they've got
It [G7]hasn't cured my broken heart but it sure helps a [C]lot
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I go out walking every night to [F]get you off my mind
[G7]But no matter where I go it seems I always [C]find
A jukebox and its flashing lights and [F]heartaches I still got
I [G7]know that drinking's not the cure but it sure helps a [C]lot
{end_of_verse}
