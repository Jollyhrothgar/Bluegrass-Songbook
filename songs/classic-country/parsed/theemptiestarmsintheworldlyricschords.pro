{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I only call when I've had that one too [F]many
And my [C]lonely room goes spinning in a [G7]whirl
And [C]tonight I couldn't even find my [F]pillow
I've got the [C]emptiest arms [G7]in the [C]world
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I no longer wear the gold band on my [F]finger
And from [C]time to time I find myself a [G7]girl
But [C]when I realize that she's not you I'm [F]holding
I've got the [C]emptiest arms [G7]in the [C]world
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
My empty arms [G7]won't ever hold you close [C]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
And these cheap hotels they're like a
Prison cell that keeps closing [G7]in
Cause [C]you alone can fill this lonely [F]feeling 
Of the [C]emptiest [G7]arms in the [C]world
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
And you alone can fill this empty [F]feeling 
Of the [C]emptiest [G7]arms in the [C]world
{end_of_verse}
