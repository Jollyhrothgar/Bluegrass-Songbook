{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]If I could step back into time for just a [Em]moment
And [F]take back all the silly things I [Fm]said
I'd [C]take the time to paint the sky a [D7]different shade of blue
And [F]stay a little [G7]longer in your [C]bed
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
If I could step back into yesterday a [Em]moment
And [F]paint the rose a different shade of [Fm]red
I'd [C]take the time to listen to the [D7]songs you tried to sing
And to [F]stay a little [G7]longer in your [C]bed
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And there'd be [F]curtains hanging [G7]on the windows [C]of my lonely room
And [F]lips to catch my [G7]teardrops when I [C]cry
Cause [F]all I've found in [G7]being free are [C]circles I can run
That [F]have no hidden places I can [G7]hide
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
If I could [C]gather all the moments that were [Em]wasted
And [F]turn each one into a ruby [Fm]red
I'd [C]buy back all the time it takes to [D7]make a dream come true
And [F]stay a little [G7]longer in your [C]bed
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
There was [F]something hidden [G7]underneath the [C]corner of your pillow
[F]Tiny lines of [G7]love I should have [C]read
And [F]all the time it [G7]takes for love to [C]grow a weeping willow
[F]I never understood the things it [G7]said
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
If [C]love were like the pages of a [Em]story
Whose [F]favorite parts could always be re-[Fm]read
I'd [C]find your laughter in between the [D7]covers of the dawn
And [F]stay a little [G7]longer in your [C]bed
{end_of_verse}
