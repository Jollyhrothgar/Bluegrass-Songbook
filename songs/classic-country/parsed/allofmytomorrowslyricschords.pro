I just lost my [D7]last hope of [G]happi[G7]ness
I [C]watched her as [D7]she walked [G]away
My [C]mind was to numb by her [G]leaving I [Em]guess
For [Am]it thought of [A7]nothing to [D7]say
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
But a [G]moment from [Em]now when her [G]steps fade [Em]away
Like the [C]echo of [D7]her last good[G]bye

While [G]all my to[D7]morrows [C]di[G]e
{end_of_verse}
