Was I to [D7]walk the floor and worry over [C]endless days to [G]come
Or [A7]cry and plead down on my knees for [D7]you

I know I vowed there'd never be another love ever for me
The [C]dream I've been [D7]searching for was [G]you
When my dream came to an end there was no use to pretend
I [C]found someone to [D7]take your place what was I supposed to [G]do
{end_of_verse}
