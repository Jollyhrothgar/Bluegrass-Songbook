[G7]To my [C]sorrow I [C7]loved you [F]only

Only [F]time can heal this longing [G7]in my heart [C]dear

I should [C]hate you for all [C7]these [F]heartaches
But to my [C]sorrow  I [G7]love you [C]yet
{end_of_verse}

[G7]To my [C]sorrow you made [C7]a vow [F]dear

Now your [C]promise and vows [C7]are [F]broken 
Why I [C]love you  [G7]I'll never [C]know

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Maybe [F]someday when your hair [G7]has turned to [C]silver
You'll be [D7]sorry that you said we had to [G7]part

Cause to my [C]sorrow  [G7]you're in my [C]heart
