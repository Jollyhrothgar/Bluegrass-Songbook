Each night the raging [C7]storm clouds take [F]away the moon [C]above

And I realize the [G7]storm has just [C]begun

Can’t you [G7]see the lighting flashing can’t you [C]hear the thunder roar
She’s gone she’s gone the damage has been [G7]done

And I realize the [G7]storm has just [C]begun

I don’t [G7]want your help or pity I don’t [C]need your sympathy

And I realize the [G7]storm has just [C]begun
{end_of_verse}
