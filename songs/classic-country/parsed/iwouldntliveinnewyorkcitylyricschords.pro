[C]It ain't nothin' but a concrete jungle with people packed like sar[G7]dines
Where everybody's tryin' to live beyond their [C]means

And like a fleas on a [C]puppy [A7]dog they [D7]got no [G7]place to [C]go

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I wouldn't live in New York City if they gave me the whole dang [G7]town
Talk about a bummer it's the biggest one [C]around
Sodom and Gomorrah was tame [C7]to what I [F]found
I wouldn't live in New York [C]City [A7]if they [D7]gave me the [G7]whole dang [C]town
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well I ain't seen the sunshine since the day that I ar[G7]rived
Cause brother I've been busy a-tryin' to sur[C]vive
Nobody knows you've been here till you're six [C7]feet under [F]ground
Than you become a [C]statistic [A7]if they [D7]remember to [G7]write you [C]down
