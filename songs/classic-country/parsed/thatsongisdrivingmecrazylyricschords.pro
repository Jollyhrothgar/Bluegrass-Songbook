[C]That song is driving me crazy I gotta hear it again
First time I heard it I was with some [C7]friends
It's a [F]simple little song you can [Fm]sing along with an [C]old time melo[A7]dy
So would you [D7]play that crazy little [G7]song again for [C]me

I [F]love that part about [Fm]break my heart and [C]baby please come [A7]home
And I [D7]love that [C]line about [Fm]hurting my [D7]mind and my [G7]beer ain't got no foam
Well [F]you'll sing high and [Fm]I'll sing low and every[C]body sing [A7]along
But [D7]everybody [C]quit while I [Fm]get my [D7]kicks singing [G7]bring that boogie home
