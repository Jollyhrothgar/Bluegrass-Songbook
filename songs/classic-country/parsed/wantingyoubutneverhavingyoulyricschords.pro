{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Wanting you but never having [C]you 
Will soon destroy what's [G]left of [D7]my [G]mind
I know that you're another man's [C]possession
And it's [G]wrong to steal the key that fits his [D7]door
[G]I know it's wrong to play in raging [C]water
But my [G]weaken will won't let [D7]me find the [G]shore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Wanting you but never having [C]you
How much longer can I stand [G]it
Where does patience draw the [D7]line
Wanting you [G]but never having [C]you
Will soon destroy what's [G]left of [D7]my [G]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I can't help it if my selfish heart desires [C]you
I can't [G]help it if I stare with hungry [D7]eyes
Each [G]time that you come near me passion [C]kindles
And the [G]fires inside [D7]start burning me [G]alive
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Wanting you but never having [C]you
How much longer can I stand [G]it
Where does patience draw the [D7]line
Wanting you [G]but never having [C]you
Will soon destroy what's [G]left of [D7]my [G]mind
{end_of_verse}
