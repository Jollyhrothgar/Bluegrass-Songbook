{meta: title A Little Left Over}
{meta: artist Vince Gill}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[F]I work my fingers to the bone 
But you won't hear me cry and moan
A working man don't need no welfare [C]line
Well I'll [F]never be a millionaire 
And frankly I don't even care
Cause all I need to have a real good [G7]time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Is a little left [C]over on [F]Saturday [C]night
If my bills are paid my plans are made 
And [D7]everything's al[G7]right
Put on my [C]ropers and them [F]wranglers a fittin' [C]tight
Got a little left over and it's [G7]Saturday [C]night
[F]I don't drink but I love to dance
With those sweet young things in their cowboy hats
Those country girls will be the death of [C]me
If [F]that's the way I gotta go Lord I hope I die real slow
Till I do I'll tell you all I [G7]need
{end_of_verse}
