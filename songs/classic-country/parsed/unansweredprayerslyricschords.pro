{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Just the other night at a [F]hometown football game
My [C]wife and I ran [Am]into [Dm]my old high school [G]flame
And [F]as I intro[Em]duced them the [Am]past came back to [F]me
And I [Dm]couldn't help but [Em]think of the [F]way things used to [G]be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]She was the one that I'd [F]wanted for all times
And [C]each night I'd spend [Am]prayin' that [Dm]God would make her [G]mine
And [F]if he'd only [Em]grant me this [Am]wish I wished back [F]then
I'd [Dm]never ask for [Em]anything [G]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Sometimes I thank [C]God [Em]  for [F]unanswered [G]prayers
Re[C]member when you're [Am]talkin' to the [Dm]Man up[G]stairs
And just [C]because he doesn't [Em]answer doesn't [F]mean he don't [D7]care
Some of [C]God's greatest [Am]gifts [Dm]are un[G]answered [C]prayers
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
She wasn't quite the angel that I re[F]membered in my dreams
And I could [C]tell that time had [Am]changed me
In [Dm]her eyes too it [G]seemed
We tried to [F]talk about the [Em]old days
There wasn't [Am]much we could re[F]call
I guess the [Dm]Lord knows what he's [Em]doin' after [G]all
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
And [F]as she walked away I [Em]looked at my [Am]wife
And then and [Dm]there I thanked the [Em]good Lord
For the [F]gifts in my [G]life
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Sometimes I thank [C]God [Em]  for [F]unanswered [G]prayers
Re[C]member when you're [Am]talkin' to the [Dm]Man up[G]stairs
That just [C]because he may not [Em]answer doesn't [F]mean he don't [D7]care
Some of [C]God's greatest [Am]gifts [Dm]are un[G]answered
Some of [C]God's greatest [Am]gifts are all too [Dm]often un[G]answered
Some of [C]God's greatest [Am]gifts [Dm]are un[G]answered [C]prayers [F]  [G]  [C]
