[G]Oh the fields were turning brown

And his [G]mother that he [D7]left at home sweet [G]home

Dear old mother how I miss [C]you
How I [G]long for your sweet [A7]face and sunny [D7]smile

And to [G]linger there for [D7]just a little [G]while

Oh the morning glory vine around
The cabin door would [C]twine
And the [G]mockingbird would sing among the [D7]tree
Then we'd take our dear old [G]book 
And go down beside the [C]brook
And [G]there for hours she'd [D7]sit and read to [G]me

Now I'm in this world alone
The old folks are not at [C]home
They've [G]gone up to a happier home [D7]above
The mockingbirds are singing [G]yet 
And I never will [C]forget
My [G]mother and dad were [D7]all I had to [G]love
