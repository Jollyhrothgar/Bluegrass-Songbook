[C]She's never in the spotlight but [F]everybody knows that she's the [C]star

She'll [C]wipe away the pain of all the [F]dues you had to pay
When the [C]curtain to her world starts to [Am]unfold
With [C]mother tender hand she will [G7]applaud and feed the hunger in your [C]soul

She sings of desperadoes and [F]lonesome whistle love and midnight [C]train
And the coal mines of Kentucky and [Am]how it feels to be out in the [G7]rain
She [C]sings of Texas cowboys of [F]hobos and of heroes
And the [C]loneliness of wearing prison [Am]blues
But [C]most of all she sings about the [G7]common people just like me and [C]you
