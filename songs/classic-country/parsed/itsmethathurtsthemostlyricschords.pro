[G]The cup on the table was the [G7]last to feel your [G]lips
The [D7]telephone was the last thing to touch your finger[G]tips
But I was the last one that your [G7]arms held so [C]close
Of all the things you [G]left here it's [D7]me that hurts the [G]most

The curtains in the window [G7]were the last to wave good[G]bye
The [D7]old clock on the mental it knows it's time to [G]cry
The walls echo your footsteps in the [G7]night just like a [C]ghost
Of all the things you [G]left here it's [D7]me that hurts the [G]most
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The mirror in the parlor [G7]had the last look in your [G]eyes
The [D7]flowers were the last to wither up and [G]die
But I'm still the last one that [G7]your arms held so [C]close
Of all the things you [G]left here it's [D7]me that hurts the [G]most
