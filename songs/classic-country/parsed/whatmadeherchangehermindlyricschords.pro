{meta: artist Hank Thompson}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]What made her [C]change from my [D7]love to my [G]used-to-be
What made her [C]wake from a [D7]dream that was [G]only me
Her last goodbye in my [B7]heart will [C]forever ring
She walked [G]away and there [A7]went my every[D7]thing
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G]What made her [C]change from my [D7]love to [G]somebody new
Was it be[C]cause of the [D7]things I for[G]got to do
What made it fade like the [B7]rays of the [C]setting sun
Somehow she [G]changed and I [D7]lost my only [G]one
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I searched my [C]heart to find [D7]out what I [G]did wrong
Those pretty [C]words all [D7]erased from our [G]happy song
Without her love in my [B7]life makes the [C]world so strange
My heart keeps [G]asking  [D7]what made her [G]change
{end_of_verse}
