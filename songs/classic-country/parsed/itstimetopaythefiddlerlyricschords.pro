{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Well it's time to pay the fiddler
And it's sad to know we've danced it all [C]away
But the warm night's [D7]disappearing
Leaving nothing but the cold hard light of [G]day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And it's time to start erasing
All the rainbows we've been chasing in our [C]minds
We know there's no [D7]way of making
Other ties on us unravel and [G]unwind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Yes it's time to pay the fiddler
And today's the day the first installment's [C]due
For the rest of all my days I'll [D7]wonder why
The maker mismatched me and [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
But there's so much to consider like my wife and little children
Will need and want my love just like you [C]do
Now it's time to pay the fiddler but before we pay [D7]the fiddler
Let's ask him to please play one last final [G]tune 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Well it's time to pay the fiddler
And there's naked sorrow dripping from your [C]eyes
Unrestrained and unashamed we [D7]love each other
Now we've got to leave it [G]lie
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
But I can feel my hands trembling
As I search to find the handle on the [C]door
So let's let the fiddler pull his [D7]magic bow
Across our heart strings just once [G]more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Yes it's time to pay the fiddler
And today's the day the first installment's [C]due
For the rest of all my days I'll [D7]wonder why
The maker mismatched me and [G]you
{end_of_verse}
