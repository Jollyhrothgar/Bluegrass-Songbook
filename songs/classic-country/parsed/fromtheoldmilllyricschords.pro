{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G7]As I [C]change out the [G7]head on the [F]old mill [C]today
I'm [F]filled with a [C]strong sense of [G7]pride
My [Am]granddaddy [F]set this mill [C]back in the [F]30's
When his [C]pasture was [G7]dusty and [C]dry
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
From the top of the [G7]tower I [F]surveyed the [C]country
He [F]carved out of [C]wide open [G7]range
He [Am]lived to see [F]big spreads cut [C]up in small [F]pieces
I can [C]still hear him [G7]cussing the [C]change
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
My [Am]granddad was cowboy clean [F]down to the [C]bone
My [Em]dad was cut from that [F]mold
And I treasure the [G7]values of [C]four gene[F]rations
As they [C]lived by the [G7]cowboy [C]code[G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
My [C]dad saw [G7]cowboy [F]youth pick up the [C]traces 
His [F]chuck wagon [C]covered in [G7]sand
He [Am]watched creeks [F]dry up be[C]cause of the [F]cedar
And the [C]mesquite thickets [G7]conquer his [C]land
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
As I sit on the [G7]tower and [F]look across the [C]pasture
I [F]wonder what [C]changes I'll [G7]find
And the [Am]wife and I [F]weather the [C]droughts and low [F]prices
Will my [C]grand children [G7]ranch in their [C]time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Will they [Am]want to be cowboy clean [F]down to the [C]bone
Will they [Em]brag about horses they [F]rode
Will they value the [G7]hard work of [C]five gene[F]rations
Will they [C]live by the [G7]cowboy's [C]rules
{end_of_verse}

[F]Will the value the [G7]hard work of [C]five gene[F]rations
