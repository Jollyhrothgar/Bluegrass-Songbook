[C]Pay no mind to her she only wants to [A]play
But she's not for [G7]you  she's not for [C]you
And I'm the only one who would let her act this [A]way
But she's not for [G7]you  she's not for [C]you

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
So she [F]told you she found heaven in your [C]eyes
[D7]Well I think it only fair to warn you [G7]that sometimes she lies
[C]But it's your heart I can't tell you what to [A]do
But she's not for [G7]you she's not for [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
She just [F]looks for greener pastures now and [C]then
[D7]And when she grows tired she knows Old Faithful 
[G7]Will just take her back again
[C]So just leave her here I'm used to feeling [A]blue
But she's not for [G7]you  she's not for [F]y-o[C]u
{end_of_verse}
