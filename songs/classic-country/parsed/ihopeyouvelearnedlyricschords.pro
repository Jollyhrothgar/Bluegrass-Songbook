{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I've been away for just a year 
Have you forgotten me my [D7]dear
The judge said I [G]must pay [C]the [G]cost
I never [D7]knew how much I'd [G]lost
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Until they [C]sent me far [G]away 
Where each minute seems a [D7]day
But maybe [G]someday I'll [C]be [G]free 
Will you be [D7]waiting there for [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I'm in this cell because of you
The crime I did you drove me [D7]to
My jealous [G]heart just could [C]not [G]stand 
To see you [D7]with another [G]man
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Until they [C]sent me far [G]away 
Where each minute seems a [D7]day
But maybe [G]someday I'll [C]be [G]free 
Will you be [D7]waiting there for [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I hope someday that you will learn
And brokenhearted you'll [D7]return
But listen [G]darling [C]please don't [G]wait 
For maybe [D7]then will be too [G]late
{end_of_verse}
