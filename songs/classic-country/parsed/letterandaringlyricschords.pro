{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I came home this morning  I looked [C]around
[D7]I called out to my darling  but not a [G]sound
[G7]And there upon the table  by an old love [C]magazine
[G]Was a letter from my [D7]baby  and a golden wedding [G]ring
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]The table told a story  I can't forget
[D7]A half a cup of coffee and a half smoked [G]cigarette
[G7]I could see she'd waited  hoping I'd come [C]home
[G]But some coffee and [D7]the cigarette  told me that she was [G]gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[D7]I opened up the letter  and read the tear-stained [G]lines
[A7]My world for me was ending  right before my [D7]eyes
[G]She said I set you free now  go on [G7]and have your [C]fling
[G]And all my baby left [D7]me  was a letter and a [G]ring
{end_of_verse}
