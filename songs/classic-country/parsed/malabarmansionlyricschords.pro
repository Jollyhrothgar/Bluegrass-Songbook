{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I was in a sad and sorry state 
The day they [C]brought me through that [G]gate      
I felt just like a bird in the great big [D7]cage
Then they [C]put me in a wing
Where the [G]lifer's think they're king
If you're [D7]weak you'll never live to see old [G]age
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Long Bay [C]Gaol you're cruel and bad
You have [G]made sane men go mad
Some have [A7]even took their lives at different [D7]times
But you [C]won't do that to me
I'll still [G]be sane when they set me free
And I [D7]pray to God to help me keep my [G]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
As crews slams doors in all the slots
He slips the [C]bolts snaps the [G]locks
Some crims keeps yelling out abuse at [D7]him
Then it was [C]lonesome time again
I had no [G]books I had no pen
Waiting [D7]16 hours to hear that big bell [G]ring

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I pace up and down my cell
I [C]feel I've died and this is [G]hell
To stop me going mad I lay and [D7]think
Of my [C]family in the scrub
My [G]pals down at the pub
And [D7]what's happening up at Saga's where I [G]drink
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
My release ain't far away 
I [C]won't worry on that [G]day
About your canes and rules you put on [D7]me
Won't hear [C]door slams in the slot
Sliding [G]bolts snapping locks
I have [D7]paid my debt again I will be [G]free
