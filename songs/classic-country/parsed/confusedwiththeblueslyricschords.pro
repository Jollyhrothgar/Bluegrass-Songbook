{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
This ravin' and cravin' around of my old heart hurts me so
[G7]I was born to be blue not a dream to come true don't [C]know
[G7]I'm hazy half crazy oh where did my sweet baby [C]go

I'm weak and I'm weary so worn out from cryin' for you

Yes I'll have to start quittin' just sittin' here singin' these blues

Slowly losin' my mind that's where these tears I can't find with a turn
[F]Way down deep in your soul is your love full of spark that still [C]burns
