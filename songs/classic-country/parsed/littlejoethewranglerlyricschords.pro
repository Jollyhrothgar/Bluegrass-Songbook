{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[F]He'd said if we would give him work he'd do the best he [C]could
[G7]Though he didn't know straight up about a cow

[F]We had hardly reached the Pecos the weather it was [C]fine
[G7]We were camped down on the south side in a draw

[G7]It took everyone of us to hold them [C]in
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
[F]Little Joe the wrangler was called out with the [C]rest
[G7]Scarcely had the little fellow reached the herd
[C]When the cattle they stampeded like [F]a hail storm on they [C]fled
[G7]And everyone was riding for the [C]lead
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 9}
[F]Amid the streaks of lightning there was one horse up [C]ahead
[G7]He was trying to catch the leaders in their speed

[G7]He was riding old Blue Rocket in the [C]lead
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 10}
[F]At last we got them milling and kinda quieted [C]down
[G7]And the extra guards back to the wagon went
[C]But there was one a-missing you could see [F]it at a [C]glance
[G7]Was our little Texas stray poor wrangler [C]Joe
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 11}
[F]Next morning just at daybreak we found where Rocket [C]fell
[G7]Down in a washout twenty feet below
[C]Beneath his horse his life was gone his [F]spur had rung its [C]knell
[G7]Was our little Texas stray poor wrangler [C]Joe
