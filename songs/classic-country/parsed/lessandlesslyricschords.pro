{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I got up and made my [G7]morning cup of [C]coffee
[G7]Fooled around the house an hour or more I’d [C]guess
[C7]I did all this before I even had one thought of [F]you
[C]More and more I [G7]think about you less and [C]less
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G7]I'm surprised but after all it's been a while [C]now
[G7]Since I lost your love and all my [C]happiness
[C7]But looks as though I just might maybe learn to smile [F]again
[C]More and more I [G7]think about you less and [C]less
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C7]I wouldn't be surprised that any day now
[F]All these teardrops I've been crying
[D7]All these heartaches you caused me
[G7]Begin withering and dying
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]Just now someone ask [G7]me if I'm hearing from [C]you
[G7]And I felt a lot like crying I’ll [C]confess
[C7]But I didn't cry I think the worst is over [F]now
[C]More and more I [G7]think about you less and [C]less
{end_of_verse}
