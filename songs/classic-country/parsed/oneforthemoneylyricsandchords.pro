[G]One for the money [C]two for the show

Not too long ago I still re[D7]member
Kisses warm and sweet and oh so [G]tender
But like a bolt of lighting strikes an [C]unsuspecting tree 
That's [D7]just how quick you've made a fool of [G]me

Everybody told me what you were [D7]doin'
They all said that you would be my [G]ruin
But like the tree that couldn't see the [C]light that's flashin' down
I [D7]closed my ears and didn't hear a [G]sound
