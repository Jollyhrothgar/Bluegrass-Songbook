{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G7]I can [C]see [F]every time I [G7]look into your [C]eyes
You [F]don't care a [G7]thing about those [Am]other [G7]guys
Without [C]words you [F]make me understand [G7]what's on your [C]mind 
The [F]rhythm of your [G7]body close to [G7][Am]m-ine
I can [C]tell by the way you [F]dance 
That you're gonna love [G7]me [C]tonight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[Am]Sometimes it's [G7]cold sometimes [C]it's [F]hot
Love's either [G7]right or it's [C]wrong
[Am]Feels so [G7]good love [C]you a [F]lot
Right here beside me is where you [G7]belong
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I don't [C]care if [F]everybody [G7]knows the way I [C]feel
[F]Until the dream of [G7]holding you is [G7][Am]r-eal
I can [C]tell by the way you [F]dance 
That you're gonna love [G7]me [C]tonight
{end_of_verse}
