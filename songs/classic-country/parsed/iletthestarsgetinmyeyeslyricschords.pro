{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I let the stars get in my eyes 
I let the moon steal my [D7]heart
You've been gone so long I couldn't stay at home
What could I do but give to him my love 
So dear to him now he's the only one I'm thinking [G]of
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Too many miles too many days 
Too many nights I was [D7]alone
His love was so grand when he held my hand 
You know how the moonlight lures you [G]on
{end_of_verse}
