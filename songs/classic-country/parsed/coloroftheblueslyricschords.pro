[C]Up above me are the skies
Like the twinkle [F]in your [C]eyes
[F]These things are the [C]color of the [G7]blues
In the [C]mail your letter came
The ink and paper [F]looked the [C]same
[F]Blue must be the [G7]color of the [C]blues
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Blue birds [F]singing in the trees
Seems to [C]sympathize with me
For he's not singing like he used to [G7]do
The [C]pretty waters in the sea
Feel as cold [F]as you left [C]me
Yes [F]blue must be the [G7]color of the [C]blues
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
There's a rainbow over head
With more blue [F]than gold and [C]red
[F]Blue must be the [C]color angels [G7]choose
A [C]blue dress you proudly wore
When you left to [F]return no [C]more
[F]Blue must be the [G7]color of the [C]blues
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Blue [F]days come and blue days go
How I [C]feel nobody knows
Life is mighty empty without [G7]you
There's [C]a blue note in each song
That I sing since [F]you are [C]gone
Yes [F]blue must be the [G7]color of the [C]blues
{end_of_verse}
