[C]I thought I could touch you just [F]for a [C]moment

I had no idea you would feel so [F]good
[D7]Until I had gone to [G7]far

I [C]should have known better it's [F]happened [C]before
But I swore the [G7]last time it won't [F]happen [C]anymore
But now it's too late to turn back the [F]damage is [C]done
So I fooled [G7]around and fell [F]in [C]love

Well I fooled [G7]around and [F]fell in [C]love
And I swore I'd never [G7]do that [C]again

Would you believe it [G7]I've done it [C][F]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
There was someone before you and some [F]in [C]between
As far as I knew you [G7]were just one [C]more

[D7]Until I had gone to [G7]far
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Now [C]all of a sudden I'm [F]right where I [C]started
Lost in the [G7]land of the blue [F]and [C]brokenhearted 
For someone so conscious [F]I sure acted [C]dumb
Think I fooled [G7]around and fell [F]in [C]love
{end_of_verse}
