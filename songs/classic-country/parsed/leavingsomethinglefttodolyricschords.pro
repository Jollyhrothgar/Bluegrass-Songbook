{meta: title Leaving Something Left To Do}
{meta: artist Johnny Rodriguez}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I've been sitting trying to get myself 
Together after being with my [G7]baby
I filled up eleven ashtrays 
And I started writing six or seven [C]songs
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But like [C7]with her I didn't finish what I started 
And I've lost jobs on 'count of [F]that
Cause I'm a [G7]doer leaving something left to do 
For someone down along the [C]track
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I don't [F]know anymore seem to care 
The least about the things I'm [C]doing
I'd rather [F]give a friend my wages 
Than to go downtown and be someone I [C]ain't
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
And if a [F]loser’s what you think I am 
Then guess that's all I’ll ever 'mount to [C]being
But I wouldn’t trade the world 
And all it’s [G7]money for the changing of my [C]name
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Drinking wine and staying up for days 
And days has kinda come to be a [G7]habit
If you wonder why I want the work 
It's cause the law advised she keep the [C]car
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
I'll get [C7]along with what I'm doing 
Guess until my head gets tired of doing [F]that
Cause I'm a [G7]doer leaving something left to do 
For someone down along the [C]track
Repeat last verse
{end_of_verse}
