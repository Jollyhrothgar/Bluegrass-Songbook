{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]How does a homing pigeon know his way back home along the route
A route that he has never ever [G7]flown 
Is it because his mate is waiting 
There that makes him beat his golden wings against the air until he's [C]home
But he must go where his heart tells him there is nothing else that he can [F]do
He's [G7]heard the call the comeback call
The call that always brings me back to [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
It's nature's [Am]way and the need is [E7]strong
It's the [D7]need to be in the place where you [G7]belong
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]What is the drive that drives a salmon on to spawn her eggs along
The rivers and the streams where she was [G7]born
She fights the rapids and she scorn the rocks and snags that drag her down
And leave her graceful silver body [C]torn
But she must go where her heart tells her 
There is nothing else that she can [F]do
She's [G7]heard the call the comeback call 
The call that always brings me back to [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
It's nature's [Am]way and the need is [E7]strong
It's the [D7]need to be in the place where you [G7]belong
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[C]Sometimes I say I'll stay away from you to see if I can break
The magic spell that binds me to your [G7]side
Then nighttime falls and something calls and like a swallow heading back
To Capistrano to your arms I'll [C]fly
Cause I must go where my heart tells me there is nothing else that I can [F]do
I've [G7]heard the call the comeback call 
The call that always brings me back to [C]you
{end_of_verse}
