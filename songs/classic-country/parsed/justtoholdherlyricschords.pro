{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]She called me up right out of the [E7]blue
I [F]hadn't heard from her I guess in a [G7]year or two
But the [C]sound of her [E7]voice on [F]that [C]little [D7]machine
Has [F]got me [G7]thinking crazy [C]things

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Like [F]fly away from everything 
Turning my back on hopes and dreams  [G7]just to [C]hold her 
Like [F]breaking the heart of the one I love
Or caring about what I'm giving up  [D7]just to [G7]hold her
How [C]can a simple [E7]hello make me [F]almost [C]lose my [D7]mind
And [F]throw away my [G7]life just to hold [C]her [G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
She [C]said let's reminisce about old [E7]times
You [F]know the number here room [G7]209
But [C]I erased that [E7]message so [F]I could [C]think it [D7]through
And [F]realized there are [G7]things a man can't [C]do
