[C]They had meant for me [F]one last time to see my [C]hometown again
Once [G7]again go there see the places where as a [C]child I've been
As I journeyed now it was [F]so far out it was [C]almost in
In the middle in the [G7]middle of no[C]where
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Sadness talked with me as I [F]walked the streets of [C]my memory
Streets [G7]that seemed somehow so much smaller now than [C]they used to be
Talked of other days when this [F]tiny place had been [C]home to me
In the middle in the [G7]middle of no[C]where
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
People stared at me in silence as I [F]walked around
Time had [C]passed till I was just a stranger [G7]there
Folks had [C]changed so much that no one even [F]knew me now
In the [C]middle in the [G7]middle of no[C]where
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I went once again to the [F]schoolyard where I [C]used to play
Passed [G7]the church of mom and daddy where [C]they used to pray
Down the dusty road to the [F]churchyard where they [C]both now lay
In the middle in the [G7]middle of no[C]where
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
As I placed my blue forget-me-nots there [F]on the ground
One last [C]time I knelt by mom and dad in [G7]prayer
Then I [C]said goodbye forever to that [F]little town 
In the [C]middle in the [G7]middle of no[C]where
{end_of_verse}
