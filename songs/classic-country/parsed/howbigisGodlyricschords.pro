{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Though men may strife to go beyond the reap of [D7]space
To crawl beyond the distant shining [G]stars
This world's a room so small within my Master's [C]house
The open [G]sky's but a [D7]portion of his [G]yard
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
How big is God how big and wide is His [D7]domain
To try to tell these lips can only [G]start
He's big enough to rule his mighty [C]universe
Yet small [G]enough to [D7]live within my [G]heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
As winter chill may cause the tiny seed to [D7]fall
To lie asleep till waked by summer's [G]rain
The heart grown cold will warm and trod with life [C]anew
The Master's [G]touch will [D7]bring the glow [G]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
How big is God how big and wide is His [D7]domain
To try to tell these lips can only [G]start
He's big enough to rule his mighty [C]universe
Yet small [G]enough to [D7]live within my [G]heart
