{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]You walked by just like you don't know me you walked [E7]by  [Am]
Maybe just to [F]show me that you're [C]walkin' by passin' [E7]up [Am]
Your last [F]chance at me and [C]I wish I hadn't [G7]been here to [C]see
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You don't cry not for this heart breaker you won't [E7]cry [Am]
You've found a new love [F]maker
And [C]he's makin' you [E7]forget the love [Am]you used to have [F]for me
And that's [C]one thing I wish I [G7]hadn't lived to [C]see

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
When [F]you see me you turn your head [C]away at the sight
[D7]I can't turn it back cryin' [G7]out in broad daylight
[C]You've passed my way a [E7]hundred times [Am]now it's too plain to [F]see
You [C]locked me out and [G7]threw away the [C]key
{end_of_verse}
