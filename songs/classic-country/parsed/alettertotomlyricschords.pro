[G]I wandered [C]by the [G]village Tom I [D7]set beneath the [G]tree
Upon the [C]schoolhouse [A7]playing ground that [D7]sheltered you and [G]me
But [C]none are left to [G]greet me Tom and [C]few are [G]left to [D7]know
That [C]played with us up[G]on the green just [D7]fifteen years [G]ago

The river’s [C]running [G]just as still the [D7]willows on its [G]side
Are larger [C]than they [Am]were dear [A7]Tom the [D7]stream appears less [G]wide
But in [C]kneeling down [G]beside the stream dear [C]Tom I [G]startled [D7]so
To [C]see how sadly [G]I am changed since [D7]fifteen years [G]ago

But [C]when our time shall [G]come dear Tom and [C]we are [G]called to [D7]go
I [C]hope they’ll lay us [G]where we played just [D7]fifteen years [G]ago
Just [D7]fifteen years [G]ago
