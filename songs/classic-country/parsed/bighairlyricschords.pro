{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]My baby's got [C]big hair
I see it flowin' down [G]everywhere
You may not like it son but [D7]I don't care
That girl was sent from up [G]above
When I get tangled up [C]in her hair
I feel just like a Texas [G]millionaire
My baby's got [D7]big hair
[C]She's the one I [G]love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
She's got a little old [D7]compact car
A mini-skirt that goes [G]way too far
A tiny Airstream at the [C]trailer park
The smallest dog you've ever [D7]seen
Now when she's wearin' them go-go boots
A tube-top and [G]dark roots
She's so sexy and she's [C]so cute
It makes a redneck wanna [D7]sing

Last Friday night I took her [D7]on the town
She wore it high while we [G]danced around
Later on you know she [C]let it down
Behind the Dairy [D7]Queen
Someday soon I'm gonna change her name
Go down to Wal-Mart and I'll [G]buy a ring
Walk down the isle with it [C]untamed
A good old boy can only [D7]dream
