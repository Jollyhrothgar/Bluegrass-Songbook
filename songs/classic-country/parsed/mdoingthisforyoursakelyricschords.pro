{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Someone else's arms will hold you my darlin' baby [C7]girl
I'll [F]never get to see the child I brought into this [C]world
Because I made one mistake folks say that I'm [C7]bad
[F]But they just don't [C]understand the [G7]way I loved your [C]dad
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Now I thought your daddy loved me [F]I was so sure he did
And [G7]so I gave him all my love and [C]he said we would wed
But I guess he must have changed his mind cause he left town one [C7]day
When [F]he found out [C]about you he just [G7]upped and ran [C]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
In this [G7]home so far away from home [F]I leave my heart [C]today
Cause [D7]home is where the heart is and [G7]with you my heart will stay
Be[C]cause I love you so much [F]why I can't make you pay
So I'm doing this for [C]your sake [G7]I'm giving you [F]away[C]
