{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Dear mama I'm coming home tomorrow
If you don't [F]mind would you meet me at the [C]train
Dear mama my wandering days are over
And it's so [D7]good to be coming home [G7]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]Dear mama we'll walk the fields together
And through the [F]valley we will stroll hand in [C]hand
[F]I just can't wait to see you and touch the [C]soil of home so [F]clean
But [C]mama I'm not the [G7]boy I used to [C]be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
For I've been gone away too long
And I've [F]done everything that's [C]wrong
But I think I finally found myself at [G7]last
And [C]just you wait and see another [F]chance is all I [C]need
But mama I'm not the [G7]boy I used to [C]be
Spoken:
You see mama I've spent time in prison
For a [F]crime that I'm too ashamed to [C]tell
And when you [F]meet me there tomorrow
Don't [C]be surprised at what you [F]see
Cause [C]mama I'm not the [G7]boy I used to [C]be
