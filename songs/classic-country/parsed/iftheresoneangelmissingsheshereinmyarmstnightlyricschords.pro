[C]Lord I've never questioned when [C7]things don't seem [F]right
But I thought that I might [C]talk with You while my baby sleeps [G7]tonight
[C]She's so much like an angel she's too [C7]good to be [F]true
If she's yours I'd like to [C]keep her [G7]if it's alright [C]with [C7]You

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]Will You search up in heaven make sure that it's [C]alright
Be sure there's [A7]not one angel up [D7]there that's took a [G7]flight
[C]Eyes of blue [F]lips like wine and arms [C]that hold [C7]me [F]tight
If there's one angel [C]missing [G7]she's here in my [C]arms [C7]tonight
