{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Your silent tears are falling on your [C]suitcase in the [A7]hall
And [D7]your trembling voice keep telling me we're [G]through
You say you're going far away from [C]me and Ida[A7]ho
To [D7]Missouri where the hurt can't get to [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But that [D7]silver bird can't take you
From the [G]cloudy things in life
So [C]don't let a lover's [G]quarrel end it [D7]all
You [G]can't run away and hide yourself 
When [C]things don't go just [A7]right
Any[D7]where you go you'll find that tears will [G]fall
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Cause it rains just the same in [C]Missouri
As it [D7]does here in old Ida[G]ho
You'll cry just the same and you'll [C]find that it rains
In [D7]Missouri or wherever you [G]go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
You seem to think that leaving me and [C]Idaho be[A7]hind
[D7]Will keep all the rainy days from [G]you
But out there in Missouri there'll be [C]times the sun won't [A7]shine
And [D7]you're bound to find the skies not always [G]blue
{end_of_verse}
