{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]The first day I saw him I'll never [D7]forget
Downtown on the sidewalk where we first [G]met
On a small wooden stand by the old timer's [C]bar
He was singing a [G]song strumming [D7]along
On an old flat top Gibson [G]guitar
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
His tall weary frame showed long years of [D7]neglect
And his pride had been buried beside his [G]respect
Recalling the day pushed his memory too [C]far
But when all's said and [G]done he was second to [D7]none
On that old flat top Gibson [G]guitar
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
On warm summer's evening when hours were [D7]mine
I'd be down there with him from seven till [G]nine
A boy of twelve years dreaming of being a [C]star
So he taught me to [G]play in his own special [D7]way
On that old flat top Gibson [G]guitar
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
We grew as close as father and [D7]son
Yet we knew that the time for the parting would [G]come
Then came the night he was not by the [C]bar
I felt so [G]alone that I cried going [D7]home
For him and that old flat top Gibson [G]guitar
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
My mother was standing by our garden [D7]gate
Pointing to a car leaving dust in its [G]wake
Your friend came by she said in that old [C]car
And he left on the [G]lawn what you wanted so [D7]long
An old flat top Gibson [G]guitar
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
The years have gone by and I'm up with the [D7]greats
I traveled all over the United [G]States
And I've searched every crowd but with no luck so [C]far
Wonder where could he [G]be and does he see [D7]me
Still playing that old flat top Gibson [G]guitar
{end_of_verse}
