[C]I showed her most of Tennessee that's [F]all I could afford
[G7]I even thought of stealing so [C]I could show her [G7]more
But she [C]never did seem happy and I [F]often heard her say
[G7]Oh I like it here (like it here) but I love Montego [C]Bay
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh I should have gone with her at [F]least I would have known
[G7]What it is about Montego Bay that [C]makes its pull so [G7]strong
All I [C]have now is her memory and the [F]way she used to say
[G7]Oh I like it here (like it here) but I love Montego [C]Bay
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]Why couldn't I convince her why [C]couldn't I make her see
That there's no way [A7]Montego Bay could [D7]need her more than [G7]me
When she [C]left she seemed so happy I can [F]still hear her say
[G7]Oh I like it here (like it here) but I love Montego [C]Bay
