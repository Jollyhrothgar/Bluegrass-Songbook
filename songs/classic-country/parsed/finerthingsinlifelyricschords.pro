{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]She was born and raised in [G7]Natchez 
The [F]daughter of a [G7]wealthy Natchez [C]man 
She never wanted for a [G7]thing in life
That her [Am]folks didn't [D7]lay right in her [G7]hands 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
She [C]drove the finest cars 
[F]Lived in a eight bedroom [C]home [E7]   [Am]   [G]
She was [C]used to the [G7]finer things 
In [F]life till I came [C]along
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I was born and raised in [G7]Memphis
Grew [F]up in a [G7]rundown river [C]shack
Never owned anything [G7]more than 
The [Am]clothes [D7]hanging on my [G7]back
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
But the [C]first time that she touched me 
[F]Wiped out all the hard times I'd [C]known[E7]   [Am]   [G]
I never [C]knew about the [G7]finer things 
In [F]life till she came [C]along
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
She's as [G7]soft as a whisper 
[F]Gentle as the snow is on the [C]toe
And the [G7]sound of her laughter 
[F]Flows like the river to the [C]dry 
And dusty [F]desert of my [G7]soul
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Her [C]folks they never liked me 
Cause [F]all that I could [G7]offer her is [C]love
Can't buy her fancy [G7]clothes 
Give her [Am]cars and [D7]vacations on the [G7]go 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
But [C]all she's ever wanted 
Was a [F]poor little boy from Tenne[C]ssee [E7]   [Am]   [G]
Now the [C]lady thinks the [G7]finest things 
In [F]life is lovin' [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
Yes the lady thinks the [G7]finest thing 
In [F]life is lovin' [C]me
{end_of_verse}
