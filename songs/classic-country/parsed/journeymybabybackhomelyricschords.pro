{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G]Bright stars were shining [B7]but clouds drifted [E7]by
Just to [A7]darken a true love [G]affair
And I know I’m to blame [B7]for the showers that [E7]fell
They meant [A7]more than my old pal could [D7]bear
[G]I can’t see what happened [B7]why I went [E7]astray
But I [A7]promise I’ll never more [D7]roam
[G]Pale moon I’ve made you my [C]promise
So [G]journey my [D7]baby back [G]home

They say that a new day [B7]is born when the [E7]sun
Climbs the [A7]stairs to the heaven so [G]blue
But to me only one day [B7]is born every [E7]year
Since I’ve [A7]cheated and been so [D7]untrue
[G]I’m weary I’m heart-sick [B7]I’ve worried I’ve [E7]cried
Go down your [A7]long silver trail start to [D7]roam
[G]Pale moon I’ve made you my [C]promise
So [G]journey my [D7]baby back [G]home
{end_of_verse}
