{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]If I hadn't quit my ways of wrong
I know what I would have done[C]
[G]I kept falling down in life 
Till I became no one
But [C]you found me just in time 
And held my head up high
And [G]showed me the right way 
I should go and made me realize[C]
I [D7]hadn't reached the [G]end of life 
Your [D7]love has pulled me [G]through
Then you [C]made me be[D7]come the man worth [G]loving you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Yes you gave me a [C]reason to keep [D7]living
And [C]made me have some [D7]faith in what I [G]do
Yes you gave me a [C]reason to start [D7]giving
When [C]I became the [D7]man worth loving [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I thought that life have turned on me 
And made me lose my faith[C]
But [G]I know now it wasn't life 
That filled my heart with pain
I [C]thought that love have turned me down 
Until you came along
But [G]now I know what real love is 
I feel it to the bone
I [D7]hadn't reached the [G]end of life 
Your [D7]love has pulled me [G]through
When you [C]made me be[D7]come the man worth [G]loving you
