{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]On a park [G7]bench one sunny after[C]noon 
Sat a [G7]young boy and a girl about seven[C]teen
As we stood so closely [C7]by watched [F]them hold each other's hands
On their [G7]faces love had written we're making [C]plans
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Then he [F]said to her you're my guiding [C]light
Then she [D7]said to him you make my whole [G7]world seem so bright
Then we [C]saw their books of Braille and [F]that neither one could see
And I [G7]thought how close they must [C]be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Such [G7]tenderness my eyes have never [C]seen 
Two young [G7]lovers both just in their [C]teens
Though their world gives them no [C7]light 
They see [F]much more than you and me
Don't you [G7]know how close they must [C]be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Then a [F]car stopped just a few steps [C]away
And a [D7]voice said Jim and Jeannie it's [G7]time to go
With their [C]hands still clutched so [C7]tight 
Helping [F]each other to the car
Can you [G7]imagine just how close they [C]are 
Don't you [G7]know how close they must [F]b--[C]e
