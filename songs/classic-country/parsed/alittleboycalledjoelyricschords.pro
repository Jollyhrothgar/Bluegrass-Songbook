{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]In a war torn land of poverty some[C]where across the [G]sea
A little boy is waitin’ he looks a lot like [D7]me
His [G]hair is like the sunlight on the [C]wings of a [G]crow
I don’t know what they named him but I’m [D7]sure they called him [G]Joe
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Just a [C]little boy called Joe like so [G]many more I know
Left all alone somewhere across the [D7]sea
I want [G]him to have my name little [C]Joe is mine to [G]claim
A little boy called [D7]Joe belongs to [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
His mother died to give him life the [C]night my orders [G]came
I wanted to be with him but war’s an evil [D7]thing
Now [G]he won’t recognize me but I’ve [C]got to let him [G]know
He means much more to someone than just a [D7]little boy called [G]Joe
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Just a [C]little boy called Joe like so [G]many more I know
Left all alone somewhere across the [D7]sea

A little boy called [D7]Joe belongs to [G]me
