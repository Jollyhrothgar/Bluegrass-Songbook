{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I don't look the way the average cowboy singer looks
[F]I'll admit I've taken things I never should'a took
You can [G7]read a different story in a lot of different books
But [F]even then you won't really know
How it [G7]was a long time [C]ago
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Women have been my trouble since I found out they weren't men
In [F]spite of that I stopped and took a wife now and then
They [G7]built their fences high but they couldn't hold me in
I was [F]born with a fire down below
And I [G7]learned to fly a long time [C]ago
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Don't ask me about the years I spent out in the rain
[F]About the ones I spent in love or the ones I spent insane
Don't [G7]ask me who I gave my seat to on that plane
I [F]think you already know
I [G7]told you that a long time [C]ago
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Me and ol' Willie Lordy we've been sold and bought
I [F]guess y'all heard about some kind of system that we fought
We [G7]ain't the only outlaws just the only ones they caught
They [F]tried to run us off but Willie's slow
I [G7]quit running a long time [C]ago
