[G]The band is playing that old melo[Am]dy
Oh it [D7]brings back summer [E7]nights and good ole [Am]Texas memo[D7]ries
And [G]I came here to chase away my [Am]blues

But [G]I don’t dance with strangers it’s a [G7]dangerous thing to [C]do

But [G]you’re tall dark and lonesome and [G7]it’s driving me [C]insane
But I don’t dance with [Dm]strangers so [D7]honey what’s your [G]name

Now listen I ain’t looking for ro[Am]mance
Oh the [D7]last thing that my [E7]heart needs now is it to [Am]take another [D7]chance

Ooo oh and [D7]maybe later [E7]on we won’t be [Am]strangers any[D7]more
