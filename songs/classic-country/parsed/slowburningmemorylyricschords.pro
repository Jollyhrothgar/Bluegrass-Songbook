{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]You taught me how to love [C]you 
Now you [G]expect me to forget [C]you
After [G]all the [D7]promises we [G]made
So I tell my heart it's [C]over 
This [G]hurt can't last [C]forever
[G]Just until the [D7]heartaches fade [G]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You've got a sl-ow [C]burning [G]memory
Maybe I'll get over you in [D7]time
[G]Sl-ow burning [C]memory
Keeps on [G]burning [D7]a hole in my [G]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The day you [C]said [G]goodbye I [C]began to realize
It [G]would take a while for my [D7]broken heart to [G]mend
I had hoped you were [C]dealing with the same [G]heartaches I'm [C]feeling
Maybe [G]our love [D7]was just dying to [G]live
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You've got a sl-ow [C]burning [G]memory
Maybe I'll get over you in [D7]time
[G]Sl-ow burning [C]memory
Keeps on [G]burning [D7]a hole in my [G]mind
