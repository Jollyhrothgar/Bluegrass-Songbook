{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I saw the [D7]Master this [G]morning
As the sun was [D7]beginning to [G]rise
He was [C]sailing white clouds across [G]Heaven
[A7]Removing the shadows of [D7]night
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G]He bent down and [D7]kissed all the [G]roses
Left blushing like [G7]sweet little [C]girls
I saw the Master this [E7][G]morn-ing
[G]As He woke  to [D7]wake up  the [G]world
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Then gently He [D7]touched all the [G]mountains
And He gave all the [D7]robins their [G]song
[C]Warm morning breeze caught the [G]lyrics
[A7]Then the mountain brook took it [D7]along
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[G]Then He whispered over [D7]the [G]mountain  
And the pretty white [G7]lilies [C]unfurled
I saw the Master this [E7][G]morn-ing
[G]As He came down to [D7]wake up the [G]world
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Then a [C]bright ray of sun broke the [Dm]Heavens
[D7]Spilled across the valleys and [G]hills
It [C]shown on the river like [Dm]diamonds
[A7]Danced on ripples and [D7]rills
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
[G]And I bowed in the light [D7]of His [G]presence
Then a sweet loving [G7]peace filled my [C]soul
I saw the Master this [E7][G]morn-ing
As He came down to [D7]wake up the [G]world
{end_of_verse}
