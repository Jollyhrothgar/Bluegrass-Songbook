[C]In your haste you left and said you'd be returning
In my sorrow I forgot to ask you [G7]when
In my lonely room I sit and count the [C]hours
Every [F]minute hoping [C]I'll look up and [G7]you'll come walking [C]in
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
For then and only then will [F]I stop [C]crying
And this aching [F]breaking [C]heart of mine will [G7]mend
Not until I [F]feel your arms around [C]me
Will [F]I'll be happy [C]and I live for [G7]then and only [C]then
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
All that's left inside my heart is just your echo
And the tiny thread of hope to which I [G7]cling
But if I keep holding on maybe some [C]day
You'll [F]remember where [C]you left me and come [G7]back for me [C]again
