{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I'm standing at the end of my [D7]world
Everything on this earth I love is [G]gone
We sometime live a lifetime in [C]day 
But [G]realize too [D7]late that day is [G]gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I'm [C]standing at the end of my [G]world
[C]Looking back o'er my wasted [D7]past
Just [G]dreaming of things that might have [C]been
If we [G]lived each new born [D7]day as if the [G]last
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
It seems all my life has been in [D7]vain
Everything that I do somehow was [G]wrong
The sunshine never follows the [C]rain
And [G]in the crowd I [D7]always stood [G]alone
{end_of_verse}
