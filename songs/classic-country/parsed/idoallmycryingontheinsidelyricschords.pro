[C]For the [Dm]first time [G7]tonight she's walked [C]out
And each [Dm]time I almost [G7]let that feeling [C]show

She [C]walks by I'm [Em]standing tall
[F]She won't see one [Dm]tear drop fall from my [D7]eyes
Cause [C]I do all my [G7]crying on the [F]insid[C]e
{end_of_verse}

I [Dm]see her out there [G7]dancing with her [C]new love
Looking [Dm]over his [G7]shoulder right at [C]me

Lord knows [C]I've seen enough[Am]
But [D7]I can't let her know that I'm that [G7]weak
