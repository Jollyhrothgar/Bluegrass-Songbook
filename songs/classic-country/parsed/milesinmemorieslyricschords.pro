{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Yes I've got lots of [D7]miles but lots of [G]memories
And I wouldn't set the [D7]miles back if I [G]could
Cause when[C]ever I get blue I know [G]exactly what to [Em]do
Just re[C]travel all those [D7]miles in memo[G]ries
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You say that all those [D7]miles are showing [G]on me
Well I'll admit I had some [D7]rough ones way back [G]when
But for [C]every mile they hold a [G]story left un[Em]told
Back [A7]there in my book of memo[D7]ries

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now as faces and [D7]places come be[G]fore me
Making up my full [D7]book of memo[G]ries
And I [C]wouldn't ever dare one [G]page to solve up [Em]there
I might [A7]want to review them all some[D7]day
