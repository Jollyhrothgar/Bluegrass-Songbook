{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]There's a sea between our hearts 
Where the [F]waves are cold and [C]dark
And the [G7]undertow of loneliness gets [C]strong
My hearts caught in the tide 
Of a [F]love that you've de[C]nied
For you're [G7]colder than this sea we're drifting [C]on
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The [F]sea between our hearts is dark and [C]stormy
And the [F]harbor of your love is the [C]only haven for [G7]me
If I [C]only had a chart to [F]guide me to your [C]heart
I'd [G7]anchor there and sail the sea no [C]more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
There's a shore of happiness 
That [F]somehow we have [C]missed
And [G7]now you've drifted off to someone [C]new
But I haunt the lonely sea
With a [F]crew of memo[C]ries
For the [G7]compass of my heart still points to [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The [F]sea between our hearts is dark and [C]stormy
And the [F]harbor of your love is the [C]only haven for [G7]me
If I [C]only had a chart to [F]guide me to your [C]heart
I'd [G7]anchor there and sail the sea no [C]more
{end_of_verse}
