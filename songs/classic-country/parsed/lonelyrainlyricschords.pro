{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I can hear you outside a-knockin' [Am]lonely rain
[D7]Beatin' out your rhythm on my [G]window pane
Since she's gone the melody's a [Am]sad refrain
And [D7]all the seasons never [G]change
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[Am]Lonely rain you [D7]sure make it [G]hard to smile
[Am]Won't you go and [D7]let the sun [G]shine a while
Cause it's [Am]bad enough she's [D7]gone with[G]out you hanging [Em]on
[Am]Whispering her [D7]name lonely [G]rain
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Once we ran and laughed in your [Am]summer showers
She [D7]brushed you from the petals of the [G]lover's flower
And hidden safe from you we used to [Am]dream for hours
[D7]Shelter my love's magic [G]power
