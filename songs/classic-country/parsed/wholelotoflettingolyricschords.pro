{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I felt the tug of the [D7]ties that bind 
As [C]I crossed that city limit sign
[G]Drivin' past that old [D7]school 
Reminds me of [Am]what I had with her
[G]A lotta roads under[D7]neath these wheels 
[C]A lotta wounds that time has healed
[Em]But time ain't changed the [D7]way I feel 
[C]Or the way things [D7]were
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I've let [G]go of chasin' those [Am]long ago dreams
[C]Turned the pages on some [G]old memories
[F]I've gotten over a [C]lot of what I've been [G]through[D7]
And I've let [G]go of thinking I could [Am]never go back
[C]Broke the chains of [G]ghosts from my past
[F]When it comes to [C]her one thing holds [D7]true
There's a [Am]whole lot of lettin' [D7]go that's left to [G]do
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I drove out to her [D7]family farm 
But [C]the live oak trees and fields were gone
[G]Rows of houses with [D7]manicured lawns 
[Am]Sat staring back at me
[G]Just like the fire from a [D7]childhood flame
Guess we're [C]all just victims of the winds of change
[Em]The way things are they're [D7]never the same 
As the [C]way things ought to [D7]be
