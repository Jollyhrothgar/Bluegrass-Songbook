[C]It seems you think that forty-five is just a little too old [G7]now 
But I’m not ready yet to be put out in the cold [C]now 
I got plenty of good love left woman if you’ll just use [G7]it 
You know the older the violin the sweeter the [C]music 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And I can play a symphony of [G7]love 
Like a thousand violins singing from [C]above 
You’re gonna really miss my loving one day when you lose [G7]it 
You know the older the violin the sweeter the [C]music 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
These specks of gray that’s in my hair just make me look [G7]distinguished 
They don’t mean I’m over the hill baby I’m not [C]extinguished 
There’s plenty of young girl’s waiting for my love honey they won’t refuse [G7]it 
They know the older the violin the sweeter the [C]music

Like a thousand violins singing from [C]above
