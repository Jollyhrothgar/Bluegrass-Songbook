{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I wonder if I’ll [G7]find you in [F]some honky tonking [C]bar
I wonder if I’ll find the hidden place you parked your [G7]car
I [F]wonder if I’ll find you holding someone [C]tight
I wonder where I’ll find [G7]you at [C]tonight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Walking’s not the [G7]fastest way I [F]know to make the [C]town
But I can’t afford no taxi driver driving me [G7]around
And [F]now I’m slowly walking toward another neon [C]light
I wonder where I’ll find [G7]you at [C]tonight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
It’s [Am]almost closing time and there’s one honky tonk to [C]go
And then checking out Joe's Coffee Shop is the only place I [G7]know
There’s gotta [F]be a reason why you’re staying out of [C]sight
I wonder where I’ll [G7]find you at [C]tonight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
It’s [Am]almost closing time and there’s one honky tonk to [C]go
And then checking out Joe's Coffee Shop is the only place I [G7]know
There’s gotta [F]be a reason why you’re staying out of [C]sight
I wonder where I’ll [G7]find you at [C]tonight
