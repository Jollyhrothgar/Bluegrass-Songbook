{meta: title The Last Love Song}
{meta: artist Hank Williams Jr.}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I know it's over 
Cause I don't keep you satisfied anymore 
But before you move [Dm]along 
Let [G7]me sing you the last [C]love song 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Tomorrow when I wake what will take the place 
Of smiles on your [Dm]face and black hair against white [G7]lace 
And I wonder if I’ll be thinking [C]of our early morning love 
All the sweet things that you'd [Dm]say 
That brightened up my darkest [G7]day 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And tomorrow night what do you sug[F]gest 
To take the place of your [Am]breast 
Pressed against my [Dm7]chest 
Oh how I'll miss your tender[G7]ness 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
But there's no use crying [C]cause loves a grown up game 
A little pleasure and then a lot pain 
First we called each other bad [Dm]names 
Then what we had was never quite the [G7]same 
I wish I could [C]find eyes that won't cry 
Lips that won't [Dm]lie  [G7]and a love that won't [C]die
{end_of_verse}
