Good As Gone
Recorded Tony Booth
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]Even though she lays beside me
She's a [F]thousand miles [C]away
And her eyes keep trying to tell me
What her lips can't seem to [G7]say
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And I [C]love to feel her near me
But I [F]know it won't last [C]long
As [F]love goes from [C]good as gold
[G7]The good is [C]gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Hands that used to know me
Have [F]forgotten who I [C]am
Arms that used to hold me
Only want me now and [G7]then
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
My [C]world around me crumbles
As [F]right goes slowly [C]wrong
And [F]love goes from [C]good as gold
[G7]The good is [C]gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
The good is [G7]gone almost [F]over [C]now
Once so [D7]strong hardly [G7]know her now
And I [C]love to feel her near me
But I [F]know it won't last [C]long
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
As [F]love goes from [C]good as gold
[G7]The good is [Am]gone
As [F]love goes from [C]good as gold
[G7]The good is [C]gone
{end_of_verse}
