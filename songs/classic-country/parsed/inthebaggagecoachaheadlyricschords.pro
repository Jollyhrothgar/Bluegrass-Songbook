{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]On a dark stormy [Am]night as the [C]train rattled [Am]on
All the [C]passengers had gone to [F]bed
Except one young man with a [C]babe in his arms
Who [D7]sat with a bowed down [G7]head
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The [C]innocent [Am]one began [C]crying  
As though it's [C7]poor heart would [F]break
One angry man said make [C]that child stop its noise
For [D7]its keeping [G7]all us [C]awake
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Put it out said [Am]another don't [C]keep it in [Am]here
We've [C]paid for our berths and want [F]rest
But never a word said the [C]man with the child
As he [D7]fondled it close to his [G7]breast
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]Where is its [Am]mother [C]go take it to [Am]her
[C]A maiden [C7]then softly [F]said
I wish that I could was the [C]man's sad reply
But she's [D7]dead in the [G7]coach [C]ahead
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
While the [B7]train [C]rolled onwards the [Dm]husband [F]sat in tears
[G7]Thinking of the happiness of [C]just a [F]few short [C]years
Baby's [B7]face brings [C]pictures of a [Dm]cherished [F]one that's dead
The baby's crying [C]can't waken [A7]her
In the [D7]baggage [G7]coach [C]ahead
{end_of_verse}
