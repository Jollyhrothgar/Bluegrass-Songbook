{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Now someday they'll wonder where [F]daddy can [C]be
So what will you tell them when they [D7]ask about [G7]me
Will [C]you tell them I cheated and [F]was so un[C]true
Will you tell them I begged for [G7]forgiveness from [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And [F]then will you tell them how [G7]you turned me [C]down
Be[F]cause of a new love they [D7]don't know you [G7]found
[C]Oh what will you tell them when they're [F]old enough to [C]see
Will you say it's your fault or [G7]blame it on [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Your [F]name will be different [G7]and they'll wonder [C]why
So [F]how will you tell them or [D7]will you even [G7]try
Oh [C]what will you tell them when they're [F]old enough to [C]see
If you think you'll lose them then [G7]blame it on [C]me
{end_of_verse}
