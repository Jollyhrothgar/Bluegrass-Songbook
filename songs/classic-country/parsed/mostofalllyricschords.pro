[G]Lot's of things in life [D7]have never [G]mattered
I never cared if [D7]winter followed [G7][G]fall
[C]But the dreams I've built for us have [G]shattered
'Cause it was you that [D7]I wanted most [G]of [G7]all

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Most of [C]all I wanted you to love [G]me
And [D7]live again those moments [G]I [G7]recall
But I [C]had to give you up to make you [G]happy
To give you up was the [D7]hardest most of [G]all
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
It seems we lead our lives [D7]in quest of [G]treasure
A phantom that [D7]eludes us one [G]and [G7]all
The [C]road of life without you has no [G]measure
And it was you that [D7]I wanted most [G]of [G7]all
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Most of [C]all I wanted you to love [G]me
And [D7]live again those moments [G]I [G7]recall
But [C]I had to give you up to make you [G]happy
To give you up was the [D7]hardest most of [G]all
