{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I was walking sad and lonely 
In a city park one day
Feeling [G7]life had really done me wrong
Nothing [C]seemed to go my way
But a soft voice from behind me 
Made me see the light of day
I [G7]sought to hear a blind man [C]say
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Do you [F]know what it's like to be [C]blind
Always [G7]feeling never seeing what you [C]want
To feel the softness of a [F]cheek
Yet never [C]see her smile so sweet
Do you [G7]know what it's like to be [C]blind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Take another look around you
My friend what do you see
Close your [G7]eyes and you see again
And you'll [C]see the same as me
Your dark days seem to vanish 
But finding ways eternally 
Night [G7]falls for us all who won't [C]see
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Do you [F]know what it's like to be [C]blind
Always [G7]feeling never seeing what you [C]want
But there's no need for darkness [F]known
There comes [C]to those who won't be shown
Yes I [G7]know what it's like to be [C]blind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Do you [G7]know what it's like to be [C]blind
{end_of_verse}
