{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[Am]Yesterday when I was [D7]young
The taste of life was [G7]sweet as rain upon my [C]tongue
I teased at life as [F#m]if it were a foolish [B7]game
The way the evening breeze may tease a candle [Em]flame
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The thousand dreams I [Am]dreamed the splendid things I [D7]planned
I'd always built to [G7]last on weak and shifting [C]sand
I lived by night and [F#m]shunned the naked light of [B7]day
And only now I see how the years ran [Em]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[Am]Yesterday when I was [D7]young 
So many happy [G7]songs were waiting to be [C]sung
So many wild [Am]pleasures lay in store for [B7]me
And so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to [Em]see
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I ran so fast that [Am]time and youth at last ran [D7]out
I never stopped to [G]think what life was all [C]about
And every conversation [Am]I can now [B7]recall
Concerned itself with me and nothing else at [Em]all
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Yesterday [Am]the moon was [D7]blue
And every crazy [G]day brought something new to [C]do
I used my magic [F#m]age as if it were a [B7]wand
And never saw the waste and emptiness [Em]beyond
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
The game of love I [Am]played with arrogance and [D7]pride
And every flame I [G]lit too quickly quickly [C]died
The friends I made all [F#m]seemed somehow to drift [B7]away
And only I am left on stage to end the [Em]play
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
There are so many [Am]songs in me that won't be [B7]sung
I feel the bitter [Em]taste of tears upon my [A]tongue
The time has come for me to [Am]pay 
For [Em]yesterday when I  [Am][B7]was  [Em]young
{end_of_verse}
