{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Lord she's restless
Like [F]cotton candy clouds that sail the [C]day
Slow and [F]free  and she [C]possesses
A [F]mind that can't resign itself to [C]stay for long with [F]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
So I [G7]tried and tried to keep her tied and [F]satisfied
Until she really [C]needs me  yes I [F]do
But [C]when that certain look comes on her [G7]face
I can't [F]replace it and she leaves [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
She's a [G7]butterfly in mid July who just can't wait to [F]try
Her brand new [C]wings on brand new [F]things
And she [C]needs no rhyme or [F]reason  when she [C]goes
Her [G7]mind is on what lies beyond that wall of Blue [F]horizon
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I [C]suppose  and heaven [F]knows
She'll go [C]sailing off on any [G7]old wind that [C]blows
Yes she [F]will  yes she [C]will
She'll go sailing off on any [G7]old wind that [C]blows
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I know she needs me
About as [F]much as I need someone [C]else
Which I [F]don't   and if need [C]be
I [F]swear someday I'll up and leave [C]myself  
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Which I won't  even [F]If she loved another [G7]man 
I'd [F]understand it more than I [C]do
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Umh umh umh but I know the only reason
That she ever [G7]has for leaving is she wants [C]to
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
She's a [G7]butterfly in mid July who just can't wait to [F]try
Her brand new [C]wings on brand new [F]things
And she [C]needs no rhyme or [F]reason  when she [C]goes
Her [G7]mind is on what lies beyond that wall of Blue [F]horizon
{end_of_verse}
