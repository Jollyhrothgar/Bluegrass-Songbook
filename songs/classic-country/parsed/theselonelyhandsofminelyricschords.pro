[C]Any girl who hangs out in a [F]honky [C]tonk

She listens while I cry on [F]her shoul[C]der

She's [F]holding these [G7]lonely hands of [C]mine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
She's [D7]holding the hands that once held [G7]you so tight
She smiles each time I call [C]her by name

She [D7]says I'm right and she gives you the [G7]blame
