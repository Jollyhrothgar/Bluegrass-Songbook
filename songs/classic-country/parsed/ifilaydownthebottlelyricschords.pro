[C]Me and that ole sunshine [F]is sinking mighty low
The difference is [C]that lucky sun [D7]has got some place to [G7]go
This [C]whiskey world I'm living in is [F]not where I want to be

I [G7]really mean it this time   [C]cross my heart
[D7]I didn't take the drink today  [G7]at least that's a start

My life seems like it's been a thousand [F]bad dreams ago
The whiskey had [C]me all dressed up [D7]with no place to [G7]go

If I lay down the [C]bottle would you [G7]lay back down with [C]me
