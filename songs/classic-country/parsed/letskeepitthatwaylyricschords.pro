{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]There's no need to lie 
Without me half [G7]trying I could [C]love you
It [A7]shows in your eyes
You feel the same way [D7]I do
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G]But wherever I go my conscience goes
[C]What more [Em]can I [A7]say
[G]It's only desire [D7]not yet a fire
Let's [G]keep it that way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Cause I [D7]don't [G]want to have to [C]tell him a [G]lie
When I get back [C]home
Cause it would [G]tear apart his [C]fairy tale [G]world
If I did him [C]wrong
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[G]And lying to him would hurt me more
[C]Than leaving [Em]you this [A7]way
So [G]before we forget we're [D7]not cheaters yet
Let's [G]keep it that way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Let's finish this wine
Cause I'm not thinking too [C]clearly tonight
The [A7]touch of your hand
Makes it so hard for me to tell [D7]wrong from right
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
[G]He waits at home he's there alone
[C]And though [Em]I'd like to [A7]stay
Be[G]fore I give in let's [D7]call it just friends
And [G]keep it that way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Cause I [D7]don't [G]want to have to [C]tell him a [G]lie
When I get back [C]home
Cause it would [G]tear apart his [C]fairy tale [G]world
If I did him [C]wrong
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[G]And lying to him would hurt me more
[C]Than leaving [Em]you this [A7]way
So [G]before we forget we're [D7]not cheaters yet
Let's [G]keep it that way
