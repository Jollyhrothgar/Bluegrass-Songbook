{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]When I found you darling then he saw his big [F]mistake
Saw [G7]what he was losing felt his heart begin to [C]break
Please don't let him talk you bout the way he's done [F]before
Why he's [G7]had a hundred chances he don't deserve you [C]anymore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Let his eyes do the crying let his feet walk the [F]floor
Let his [G7]heart do the breaking like he's let yours break [C]before
Let his lips do the sighing let his heartaches start to [F]soar
Let his [G7]arms do the aching he don't deserve you [C]anymore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
He took you for granted and he only brought you [F]shame
It [G7]was never his intention to let you share his [C]name
The lonely hours you've waited now won't happen [F]anymore
For [G7]it's his turn to feel the hurt he don't deserve you [C]anymore
{end_of_verse}
