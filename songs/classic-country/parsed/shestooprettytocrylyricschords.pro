[C]She don’t know that I’m not sleeping
As she [F]lays there softly [C]weeping
I can’t believe that I’ve been so [G7]unkind
But the [C]soft touch of another

And she’s [E7]laying there [F]so unsatis[G7]fied

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
She’s too [C]pretty to cry I must be [F]out of my mind
To [G7]wish for someone [F]else when [G7]she’s [C]here by my side
Lord turn my heart around I don’t want to [F]let her down
She’s too [G7]good to be blue [F]she’s too [G7]pretty to [C]cry

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Right now her heart is breaking
But I [F]can’t help her stop the [C]aching
Another holds the key that turns me [G7]on
She de[C]serves so much better
Only [F]half a man would [C]let her
[E7]Lay there thinking [F]she’s done something [G7]wrong
