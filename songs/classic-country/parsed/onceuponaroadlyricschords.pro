{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Once upon a [F]road  when I was innocent and [C]free
And the back roads of [G7]America  were like toy land to [C]me
It surely was the [F]promised land  and we had ourselves a [C]dream
Oh how the milk and honey [G7]flowed  [F]once upon a [C]road
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Once upon a [F]road  we could live off of the [C]land
Watermelons on the [G7]vine  chicken cookin' in a [C]pan
Water clean and water [F]free  you could sleep beneath a [C]tree
Love and freedom was our [G7]code  [F]that was once upon a [C]road
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Once upon a [F]road  really was a crazy [C]time
We believed we could move [G7]mountains  so we moved them in our [C]minds
Blood and sweat and bitter [F]tears  took the days and took the [C]years
We have little left to [G7]show  [F]for being once upon a [C]road
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Once upon a [F]road  we were young and we were [C]fair
Changed the face of all [G7]America  
But never hung around in the barber [C]chair
We were fighting for a [F]dream  fought a mighty big [C]machine
There ain't nothing that we [G7]know  [F]for being once upon a [C]road
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
We have little left to [G7]show  [F]for being once upon a [C]road
{end_of_verse}
