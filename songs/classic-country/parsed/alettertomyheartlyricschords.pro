{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Dear heart there is [D7]something I must tell [G]you
Something [D7]sad and so hard for me to [G]say
For I [C]know how much you always loved [G]her
And how you [D7]always hoped that she'd come back [G]someday
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But day after day [D7]my hopes grow [G]dimmer 
As I [D7]watched life and love passing me [G]by
And the [C]life I live is empty and so [G]lonely
But you just [D7]lived for her and slowly let me [G]die
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
You [C]know she left me for [G]another 
So [D7]give her up let her go let it [D7][G]b-e
Dear [G]heart if [D7]you won't stop beating for [C][G]h-er 
Then dear [G]heart  [D7]stop beating for [G]me
{end_of_verse}
