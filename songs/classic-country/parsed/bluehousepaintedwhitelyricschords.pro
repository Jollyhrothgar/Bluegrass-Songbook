{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]The party’s all over they’re dimming the [C]lights
My [D7]friends they are leaving and saying [G]goodnight
It’s time to go now before tears dim my [C]sight
Where [D7]I live all alone in my blue house painted [G]white
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The [D7]teardrops start when I open the [G]door
The [A7]silence tells me she’s not here [D7]anymore
I [G]guess it’s by habit I call her name through the [C]night 
But [D7]to me there’s no answer in my blue house painted [G]white
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Just a small bungalow that we built just for [C]two
We [D7]painted it white and left out the [G]blue
But too many parties and staying out [C]nights
Is [D7]what put the blue in my blue house painted [G]white
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The [D7]teardrops start when I open the [G]door

I [G]guess it’s by habit I call her name through the [C]night 
But [D7]to me there’s no answer in my blue house painted [G]white
