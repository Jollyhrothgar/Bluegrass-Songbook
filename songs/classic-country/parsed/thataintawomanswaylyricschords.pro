{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I sat [F]alone at [G7]home all weekend [C]waitin' for [G7]you to [C]call
But the [F]phone didn't ring and the [C]door didn't knock 
And I sat there [G7]talkin' to the [C]wall
[F]Then today when you [C]did come around 
It didn't mean [G7]nothin' to [C]you
You [F]say in your heart you [C]know you love me 
And I oughta [G7]know it [C]too
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But that ain't a [F]woman's [C]way baby 
That ain't a [F]woman's [C]way
A [F]woman has to [C]know she's loved
And [F]needed every [C]day
All you wanna [F]do is [C]tease me 
All you wanna [G7]do is [C]play
Breakin' up [F]makin' up [C]stayin' 
All shaken up [G7]that ain't a woman's [C]way
No [G7]that ain't a woman's [C]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Just [F]today I [G7]begged you please 
Let's [C]have a little t[G7]alk about u[C]s
But [F]you said no that [C]you had to go 
And we ended up [G7]havin' a [C]fuss
If [F]I asked you to [C]give me a ring 
You probably [G7]would on the [C]phone
Some[F]times I can't [C]help but think 
I'd be better [G7]off a[C]lone
