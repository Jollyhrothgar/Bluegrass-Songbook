{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I remember Grand[G7]pa standing [F]over by the [C]gate
His eyes turned up to [G7]heaven wondering [F]why the rain was [C]late
And it [F]seems so sad to look back now and [C]see him lying there
In a $500 [G7]casket with the [F]dirt still in his [C]hand
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
It's a [F]sad truth when the wind can blow a [C]man's whole life away
Like it [F]strips the topsoil from the ground where the [C]corn grew yesterday
Makes him a [F]disappearing farmer cause his [C]dreams rode with that wind
And all he knows is [G7]dominoes and some [F]close old wrinkled [C]friends
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Grandpa saw it [G7]comin' of [F]that there ain't no [C]doubt
With the bankers on his [G7]doorstep and a [F]cotton killin' [C]drought
But he was a [F]kind and he was a gentle man [C]until the bitter end
And he was smilin' on his death[G7]bed glad he [F]hadn't sold out to [C]them
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Now a modern two lane [G7]blacktop runs [F]across the old [C]homeplace
And the man that ran the [G7]graveyard didn't [F]recognize my [C]face
And the [F]ground beneath seems drier now my [C]God when will it rain
And pushing pretty [G7]flowers [F]around my grandpa's [C]grave
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
It's a [F]sad truth when the wind can blow a [C]man's whole life away
Like it [F]strips the topsoil from the ground where the [C]corn grew yesterday
Makes him a [F]disappearing farmer cause his [C]dreams rode with that wind
And all he knows is [G7]dominoes and some [F]close old wrinkled [C]friends
