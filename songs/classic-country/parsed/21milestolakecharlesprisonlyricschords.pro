{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Oh momma I’m [F]so thankful you [C]came
It’s late and I hate about this [G7]rain
I [F]know it’s hard on you but [C]I don’t know what I’d [F]do
If you weren’t [C]here momma to walk [G7]me to the [C]train
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
21 miles  to [F]Lake Charles [C]Prison
A few more hours my life will cease to [G7]be
But I won’t mind [C]that last mile I’ll walk it with a [F]smile
As [C]long as your sweet face is the [F]last thing [G7]that I [C]see
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Oh how I wish I could [F]turn back the pages of [C]time
And rewrite those few minutes I went [G7]insane
Yes [F]I took her for my wife [C]and was forced to take her [F]life
Now in [C]chains I ride the [G7]Lake Charles Prison [C]train
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
21 miles to [F]Lake Charles [C]Prison
13 men wearing balls and [G7]chains
But [C]I’m richer by far than all of them together [F]are
All [C]because momma you [G7]walked me to the [C]train
{end_of_verse}
