{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]We all were called to [F]come back to the [C]old home on the farm
[G7]Mother passed away what a mournful [C]day
And as my [F]daddy watched his eyes were [C]filled with pain and hurt
When [D7]someone stepped upon a rose and [G7]crushed it in the dirt
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Don't [C]step on mother's [F]roses daddy [C]cried
She [G7]planted them the day she was my [C]bride
And [F]every time I see a rose I [C]see her smilin' face
She [D7]made my darkest days look bright [G7]round the old home place
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Don't [C]step on mother's [F]roses let 粗m g[C]row
The [G7]way they did since many years [C]ago
They'll [F]bloom for me each year and [C]I'll have mother near
Don't [D7]step on mother's [G7]roses let 'em [C]grow
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Years have passed [F]away and how the [C]old home place has changed
[G7]Daddy had to go we [C]all miss him so
Children pick the [F]roses as they [C]go along the way
But [D7]when their petals are abused I [G7]hear my daddy say
