[G]As long as I can see Him [C]hangin' on a distant [A7]cross
[D7]Dyin' between two common thieves spat upon and [G]mocked [D7]

Don't spare the [D7]agony of [C]Gethsema[G]ne

If I can hear the hammering and [C]see Your wounded [A7]side
If [D7]I can feel the pain You felt when You hung Your head and [G]died [D7]
As [G]long as I can see forgiveness in Your [C]eyes of love for [A7]me
Then I can [D7]be what You want me to [G]be
