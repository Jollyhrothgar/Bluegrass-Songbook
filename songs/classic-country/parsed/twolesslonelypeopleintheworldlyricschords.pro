{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]There are millions just like [Am]us
[D7]In this lonely world [G]tonight
I need someone so do [Am]you 
[D7]I can see it in your [G]eyes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Cause the world can be so [C]cold on your [D7]own
And the [C]night never ends when you're [D7]alone
For [G]once in our lives let's [C]forget wrong or right
And [G]stay together till the morning [C]light
There'll be [G]two less lonely [D7]people 
In the world [G]tonight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Though we're strangers you and [Am]I
[D7]We both know each other's [G]soul
All the feelings that we [Am]hide
[D7]Only lonely people [G]know
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
All the emptiness of [C]night coming [D7]on
And the [C]chill of waking up [D7]alone
For [G]once in our lives let's [C]forget wrong or right
And [G]stay together till the morning [C]light
There'll be [G]two less lonely [D7]people 
In the world [G]tonight
{end_of_verse}
