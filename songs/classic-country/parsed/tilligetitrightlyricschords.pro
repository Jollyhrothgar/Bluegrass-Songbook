{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I'll just keep on falling in love till I get it [D7]right
[F]Right now I'm like a [G7]wounded bird hungry for the [C]sky 
But if I try [F]my wings and try long [G7]enough
[C]I'm bound to learn to [F]fly 
So I'll just keep on falling in [G7]love
[C]Till I get [F]it [C]right 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
My broken door has opened out more times than [D7]in  
[F]And I'm either fool or [G7]wise enough to open it [C]again       
Cause I'll never [F]know what's beyond the [G7]mountain
[C]Till I reach the other [F]side 
So I'll just keep on falling in [G7]love
[C]Till I [F]get it [C]right
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
If practice makes perfect then I guess
I'm as perfect as I'll ever be in my [F]life
So I'll just keep on falling in [G7]love
[C]Till I [F]get it [C]right
{end_of_verse}
