{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I know you've seen her kind before
She lives [F]behind the swinging [C]doors
She paints her face and wears her dresses [G7]tight
She'll [C]dance and drink your wine
Feed the [F]jukebox all your [C]dimes
Cause she's [F]everybody's [G7]baby every [C]night
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The first dance [F]of the night is mine
She'll do the fast two step with [C]John
Watch her glide across the floor with Billy [G7]Joe[D7]   [G7]
That slow [C]dance she'll give to Don
Kentucky [F]Waltz belongs to [C]Tom
And then [F]God only [G7]knows who'll take her [C]home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I wish that all the world could see
The happy [F]girl she used to [C]be
Though she wasn't always like she used to [G7]be
She had [C]dreams she had plans
To give her [F]love to just one [C]man
Some[F]how that all got [G7]lost along the [C]way
