{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I'm gettin' out of this high rise [C]penthouse [G]suite

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And these high class friends that you [C]like to hang [G]around
When they look my way they're always looking [D7]down
Well I'm [G]tired of you spending every [C]dime I [G]make
To finance this way of life [D7]I've learned to [G]hate
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I'm going [C]back to a better class of [G]loser
This uptown living's really got me [D7]down
I need [G]friends who don't pay their bills on [C]home com[G]puters
And who [A7]buy their coffee beans already [D7]ground

[G]It takes more than [D7]caviar to have a [G]ball
