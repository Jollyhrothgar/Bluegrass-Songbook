{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Every night you go to bed [G7]crying
There's nothing left to do when love is [C]dying
So before the whole world knows how we're [F]hurtin
[G7]Don't you think it's time we pulled the [C]curtains
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
So many times I talked you out of [G7]leaving
And so many times you've tried to fight the [C]feeling
I guess we've tried and failed once too [F]often
[G7]Now the suitcase down the hallway does the [C]talking
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
That just about does it  don't [G7]it
That'll just about kill it   won't [C]it
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Maybe we should call a truce
We could but what's [F]the use
That [G7]just about does it  don't [C]it
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
It's sad to think that words could come between [G7]us
And what I said  God knows  I didn't mean [C]it
It's time we realized this time it's [F]over
[G7]It's tearing us apart to stay [C]together
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
That just about does it  don't [G7]it
That'll just about kill it   won't [C]it
{end_of_verse}
