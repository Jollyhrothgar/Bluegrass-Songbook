[C]We're two of a [F]kind you and [C]me

We're [C]two of a [G7]kind me and [C]you

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]We belong together we shouldn't drift [C]apart
For [F]each new love we meet we leave 
Just [C]one more broken [G7]heart
As [C]long as we find pleasure 
We [C7]don't care what we [F]do
We're [C]two of a [G7]kind me and [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I under[F]stand you baby you understand me [C]too
[F]I'm no good for no one else 
But the [C]same thing goes for [G7]you
Now if [C]fate and time can change us 
We'll [C7]find a life as [F]true
For [C]two of a [G7]kind like me and [C]you
{end_of_verse}
