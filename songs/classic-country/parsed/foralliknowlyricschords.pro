{meta: title For All I Know}
{meta: artist Merle Haggard}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]For all I know you [C]never cared about [G]me
And chances are I [D7]never crossed your [G]mind
Maybe you won't [C]understand me [G]calling
But [A7]darling it's been such a long long [D7]time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G]For all I know there [C]may be someone with you [G]now
But maybe he [D7]won't mind a friendly [G]call
You've already made it clear that [G7]you stopped loving [C]me
And for [G]all I know you [D7]never cared at [G]all
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I can't [C]help it if I sound like I've been [G]crying
Cause darling I've been crying all night [D7]long
I [C]just call to let you know just how much I need [G]you
And [A7]for all I know you may be there [D7]alone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[G]Surely you must know I'd give [C]the world to see you [G]now
And could be you'd like to [D7]have me one more [G]time
You've already made it clear that [G7]you stopped loving [C]me
But for [G]all I know I [D7]may have lost my [G]mind
[C]And for [G]all I know I [D7]may have lost my [G]mind
{end_of_verse}
