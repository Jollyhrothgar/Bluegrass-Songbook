[C]When these arms of mine grow [F]tired of holding [G7]you

When these lips of mine grow [F]cold from kissing [G7]you
And [C]I lose the thrill of [F]loving like we [G7]do
[C]When these eyes of mine go [F]blind
And your [G7]face I cannot [C]see
I'll be more than [F]happy  [G7]to set you [C]free

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
When my ears are deft and [F]I can hear no [G7]more
All [C]the sweet things you [F]have whispered back [G7]before

[G7]And when they bury [C]me
I'll be more than [F]happy  [G7]to set you [C]free
