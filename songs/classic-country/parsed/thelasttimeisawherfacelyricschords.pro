{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]The last time I saw her [Dm]face
[G7]Her eyes were bathed in starlight and her hair hung [C]long
[Dm]The last time she spoke to me
[G7]Her lips were like the scented flowers inside a rain-drenched [C]forest
[F]But that was so [G7]long ago that I [F]can scarcely [C]feel
[Dm]The way I felt before  and if time [G7]could heal the [C]wounds
[F]I would tear the threads away that I might bleed some [G7]more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]The last time I walked with [Dm]her
[G7]Her laughter was the steeple bells that ring [F]to greet the morning [G7]sun
[F]A voice that called to [G7]everyone to [F]love the ground we walked [G7]upon
[C]Those were her good days
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[Dm]The last time I held her hand
[G7]Her touch was autumn spring and summer and winter [C]too
[Dm]The last time I let go of her
[G7]She walked away into the night I lost her [F]in the misty [G7]streets
[F]A thousand months a [G7]thousand years when other [F]lips will kiss her [G7]eyes
[F]A million miles [G7]beyond the moon that's where she [C]is
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[Dm]The last time I saw her face
[G7]Her eyes were bathed in sadness and she walked [C]alone
[Dm]The last time she kissed my cheek
[G7]Her lips were like the wilted leaves upon the [F]autumn covered [G7]hills
[F]Resting on the [G7]frozen ground the seeds [F]of love lie cold and [G7]still
[F]Beneath a battered [G7]marking stone it lies [C]forgotten
{end_of_verse}
