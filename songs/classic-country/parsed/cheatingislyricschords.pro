{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Cheating is a thing that starts when you bring
Two lonely people face to face with a brand new [F]kiss
[G7]She blames him he blames her
But neither one is ever quite sure which way it really [C]is
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And [F]all of the time in the back of their minds
They know they're gonna have to lie bout where they've [C]been
Cheating is a thing that'll take a little ring
And [G7]break it into pieces that'll never go together [C]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Cheating is the part of loving that starts
When true love isn't what lovers are looking [F]for
[G7]A stranger here a stranger there then you turn around and swear
That you'll never go back for [C]more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
And [F]lying at night when you're holding him tight
Is sometimes that a cheater's heart just has to [C]learn
Cheating is a thing that's guaranteed to bring
Two [G7]unhappy people to the point of no [C]return
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
The [F]worst of cheating is the sad little kids
Hanging in the middle while mommy and daddy [C]choose
Cheating is a game where nobody wins
And the [G7]ones that aren't big enough to play are the ones who [C]lose
{end_of_verse}
