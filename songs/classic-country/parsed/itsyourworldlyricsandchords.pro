{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]It's your world and your smile turns on my [F]sunshine
You have [G7]all the power it takes to keep me [C]blue
You control the way I feel both day and night [F]time
It's your [G7]world and I'm just passing [C]thru
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C7]Let me [F]live let me live
Let me [C]live in live in your world
If [G7]only for part of the [C]time
There [F]must be there must be
Oh [C]sweet love in  your world
Cause there [G7]just isn't any in [C]mine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
It's your world and I don't belong in [F]it
Foolishly [G7]I keep pretending that I [C]do
From the first you've made it plain that you don't need [F]me
It's your [G7]world and I'm just passing [C]thru
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C7]Let me [F]live let me live
Let me [C]live in live in your world

There [F]must be there must be
Oh [C]sweet love in  your world
Cause there [G7]just isn't any in [C]mine
