[C]I'm so [G7]alone tonight and [C]blue
No one to tell my troubles [G7]to
My darling's [F]gone my heart is [C]broke
For all she left [G7]was just a [C]note
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I'm through with [G7]you was all she [C]wrote
This is goodbye was in her [G7]note
My heart can't [F]stand no more your [C]lies
That's all she wrote [G7]this is good[C]bye
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
But it didn't tell [G7]of all the [C]heartaches
All the pain that she went [G7]through
If only [F]I could re[C]pay her
Maybe my heart [G7]would not be [C]blue
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I can't blame her [G7]now for [C]leaving
For I know I played it un[G7]fair
Still my [F]heart won't stop its [C]grieving
With no one to love [G7]no one to [C]care 
{end_of_verse}
