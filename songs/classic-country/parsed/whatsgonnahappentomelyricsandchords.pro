{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]The flowers of love came to wither and [G7]die
Our romance was never to [C]be
No matter what happened I [F]know you’ll get by
Oh [G7]what’s gonna happen to [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I’ll never be able to love someone [G7]new
Cause somehow I’ll never feel [C]free
I’m sure you’ll find someone to [F]care about you
But [G7]what’s gonna happen to [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
If ever you’re lonely I’ll always stand [G7]by
Wherever you happen to [C]be
I’ll never forget you there’s [F]no use to try
Oh [G7]what’s gonna happen to [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
When years tells their story and gray’s reached my [G7]hair
You’ll still be a sweet memo[C]ry
It’s hard to go on knowing [F]that you don’t care
Oh [G7]what’s gonna happen to [C]me
{end_of_verse}
