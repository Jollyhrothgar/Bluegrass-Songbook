{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]If you could step into my soul 
For just a [Dm]little while
You'd [G7]feel like a man condemned
And walking [C]your last mile
You'd be without the cause to live
With [C7]the mind of a [F]child
Yes I'm what you could [E7]turn in[A7]to
If you [Dm]let your [G7]memories run [C]wild
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I'm a [G7]man you can save who [D7]fell by the way
Too far gone for love to [G7]save
Oh sure I complain but I [D7]know who's to blame
It was me who drove her [G7]away
If you could [C]step into my soul
You'd know just [Dm]how it feels
When [G7]love leaves a wound that time
Just can't seem to [C]heal
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
To walk through a lonely world
We [C7]long for just a [F]smile
Yes I'm what you could [E7]turn in[A7]to
If you [Dm]let your [G7]memory run [C]wild
{end_of_verse}
