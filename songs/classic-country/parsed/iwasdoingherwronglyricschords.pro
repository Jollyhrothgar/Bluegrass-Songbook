[C]Waitress would you bring me one more shot of your best gin

Or any other low down doing her [C]wrong songs

The immature I used to be was rowdy loose and loud
But now I’m a regular [C7]member of the [F]crowd

While I was doing her [F]wrong he was loving her [C]right

Living a[F]lone such a pitiful [C]sight
She’s doing me [G7]wrong and he’s loving her [C]right
