[C]Cheating fire  [F]gonna burn [C]higher
Still we lay here in the ashes [G7]unconcerned
Every [C]night the same old thing we [F]just pour fuel on the [C]flame
Before this cheating fire goes out [G7]someone's gonna get [C]burned
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Here we are again to far [F]gone to gain [C]control
If we can't find a way to kill the [G7]flame
We get [C]lost in our love [F]don't know which way to [C]turn
So we'll just build a fire and [G7]let it [C]burn

It don't feel so wrong [F]cause the fire's gone out at [C]home

And tonight we'll build [G7]another cheating [C]fire
