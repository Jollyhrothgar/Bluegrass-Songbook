[C]Thought you would be the last one [C7]I run into to[F]night
How I’m [G7]doing thanks for asking but guess the [F]answer’s in my [C]eyes

My days all [F]end in [C]why and [F]sometimes late at [C]night
I swear I [F]smell the [C]sweet perfume on the [D7]pillow next to [G7]mine
I [C]guess I’ll [F]never [C]understand [F]why you said [C]goodbye
And as each day [F]slowly [C]turns to [F]night my [C]days all [G7]end in [C]why

Our friends have all stopped calling by [C7]guess they don’t wanna [F]see
How [G7]questions left unanswered [F]have taken toll on [C]me
And no one speaks your name no more [C7]scared I’ll break down and [F]cry
And as each day slowly [C]turns to night my [G7]days all end in [C]why
