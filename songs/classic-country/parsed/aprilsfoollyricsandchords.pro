{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G7]There's no [C]way [F]I could ever [C]leave her
I'm addicted to her [F]love can't [G7]break the tie
A [Am]victim of my own [F]need and too [C]far to ever be [F]free
Every[D7]thing she does I somehow justi[G7]fy
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I'm April's [C]fool I play by her [F]rules
She [G7]treats me any old way she [C]wants to [G7]
Just as [C]sure as clouds bring showers 
And [F]springtime brings May flowers
And a [G7]mountain breeze blows cool I'm April's [C]fool[G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Many [C]times [F]I've tried to live with[C]out her
Like a frightened runaway [F]child I'd [G7]always return
To the [Am]games she loves to [F]play where she [C]always gets her [F]way
Al[D7]though it hurts I never seem to [G7]learn
