[C]I’ve always been the kind of man
[G7]Who doesn't believe in strings
[Am]Long term obligations
[E7]Are just unnecessary things
[F]But girl you’ve got me [G7]thinking
[E7]While I’m drinking one more [Am]beer
[D7]If I’m headed for a heartache
[Dm]Then why the hell am I still [G7]here

[C]I’m testing my resistance
[G7]And it’s wearing mighty thin
[Am]I’ve got the feeling I should leave
[E7]Before the roof caves in
[F]My mind tells me to move [G7]along
[E7]But my body begs me [Am]stay
[D7]And now I feel the need to hold you close
[Dm]And love the night [G7]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
While you’re turning me
[F]Every which way but loose you turn me
[C]Every which way but loose
[G7]Inside the fire is burning me in my [C]mind
[C7]You just keep turning me
[F]Every which way but loose
[C]Baby there’s no excuse to turn [A7]me
[Dm]Every which [G7]way but [C][F]loose
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
When the sun comes up in the morning
[G7]It should find us someplace new
[Am]But right this minute all I want
[E7]Is to lay here next to you
[F]Those memories still keep calling [G7]me
[E7]From somewhere in my [Am]past
[D7]Better hurry if they want me
[Dm]Cause I can feel me fading [G7]fast
