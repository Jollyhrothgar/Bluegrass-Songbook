[C]I saw her for the [F]first time in a [C]small cafe 
Where [F]I was pickin' [Dm]songs [G7]just to get [C]along 
A Denver woman so [F]fine she took my [C]breath away 
When she [F]smiled and said I [Dm]sure do [G7]like your [C]songs[G7] 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
At [C]first I think she [F]came just to dig my [C]music 
But later [F]on a special [Dm]gold [G7]filled her [C]eyes 
Warmer than the [F]sweet red wine she's [C]drinkin' 
[F]What comes next I [Dm]suppose is [G7]no sur[C]prise 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Cause the [F]first time she let [G7]go was in my [C]arms 
She's as [F]pure as a Rocky [G7]Mountain airy [C]breeze 
She said I [F]always knew that it would [G7]take a special [C]man for [Am]me 
[C]And the [Dm]first time she let [G7]go Lord it was [C]me 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Nights get cold when the [F]snow falls in the [C]Rockies 
But [F]the fireplace has a [Dm]warm and [G7]friendly [C]glow 
I've got my friends my guitar [F]and my Denver [C]woman 
And I [F]remember well the [Dm]first time [G7]she let [C]go
