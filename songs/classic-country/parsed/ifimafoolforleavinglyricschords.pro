[C]This morning I am leaving  I've [F]been up all night [C]long
You're right I'm tired of waiting for you to come [G7]home
I've [C]begged and tried to change you  but [F]you've grown worse each [C]day
If I'm a fool for leaving  I'd be [G7]twice the fool to [C]stay
{end_of_verse}

I'd [F]rather be called foolish  and find somebody [C]else
Then to be a fool forever and not forgive [G7]myself
I'm [C]exactly what you've made me  but I [F]hope to change [C]someday
If I'm a fool for leaving  I'd be [G7]twice the fool to [C]stay
{end_of_verse}
