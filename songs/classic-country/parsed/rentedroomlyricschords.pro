{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]It's true he owns a mansion
And a big black limou[C]sine
Tennis courts and [G]swimming pools
Like those in maga[D7]zines
I’m [G]married to a rich man
We've got things and money [C]too
But I'd trade it all for [G]one more night
In a [D7]rented room with [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[D7]I'd trade it all for one more night
And [C]never ask for [G]more 
Just a place to [C]fall in[G]side your arms
Is what I'm aching [D7]for
He don't [G]take the time to hold me
He don't love me like you [C]do
So I'd trade it all for [G]one more night
In a [D7]rented room with [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I [D7]know it's wrong but he don’t feel 
The [C]way I do with [G]you
But he loves [C]money [G]more than me
Now ain't that cheap [D7]too
Too [G]busy making money 
When making love would [C]do
So I'd trade it all for [G]one more night
In a [D7]rented room with [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I'd [C]trade it all for [G]one more night
In a [D7]rented room with [C]you[G]
{end_of_verse}
