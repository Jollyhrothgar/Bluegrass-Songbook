{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]It's my fault maybe [C]anyhow [G]baby
I didn't guarantee our love [D7]affair
But [G]if you'll stop moaning [C]moping and [G]groaning 
I'll see if I've got [D7]one more night to [G]spare
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]I ain't got time to fuss and fight it's [G]wearing down my style
If [C]you'll start acting halfway right I'll [G]stick around a [D7]while
So [G]let's get hopping with the [C]beer cans [G]popping
While I've still [D7]got another night to [G]spare
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Moon light falling [C]highway [G]calling
I think there may be greener grass [D7]somewhere 
But [G]I like your cooking and [C]you ain't bad [G]looking
So maybe I've got [D7]one more night to [G]spare
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]Lord I know you can be fun [G]when you ain't on your broom
It [C]might be love in a blossom tied if [G]you'll just give it [D7]room
If [G]you'll just shut up [C]we'll both [G]cut up
Cause I've got [D7]one more night to [G]spare 
{end_of_verse}
