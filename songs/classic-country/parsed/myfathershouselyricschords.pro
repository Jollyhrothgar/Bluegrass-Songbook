[F]I heard the wind rustling through the [C]trees
[G7]And ghostly voices rose from the fields

[G7]With the devil snappin' at my [C]heels
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]I broke through the trees and there in the [C]night
[G7]My father's house stood shining hard and bright
[C]The branches [F]and brambles tore my clothes and scratched my [C]arms
[G7]But I ran till I fell shaking in his [C]arms
{end_of_verse}

[F]I awoke and I imagined the hard things that pulled us [C]apart

[G7]I could see his windows shining in [C]light

{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
[F]My father's house shines hard and [C]bright
[G7]It stands like a beacon calling me in the night
[C]Calling and calling [F]so cold and [C]alone
[G7]Shining across this dark highway where all our sins lie [C]unatoned
{end_of_verse}
