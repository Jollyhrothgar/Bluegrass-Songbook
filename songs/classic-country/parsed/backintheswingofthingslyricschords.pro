{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Oh I was feeling down I'd really been uptight
About to lose my mind when I [Am]came in here [D7]tonight
[C]Things have turned [Am]around since they [D7]turned the jukebox on
No longer got sit down some[G]body played my [D7]song
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And I'm [G]back in the swing of [D7]things an amazing change takes [G]place
When I hear those twin fiddles [Am]play
Now [D7]there's a difference of daylight and dark in my heart
All the music keeps all my blues [G]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now when those [C]playboys are playing
I'm [G]feeling no [Em]pain
I'm [C]right back in the [D7]swing of [G]things
Yes I [E7]am  [C]back in the [D7]swing of [G]things
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Now would you care to dance and join me in some fun
Could be our last chance cause the [Am]night is almost [D7]gone
[C]It's hard to [Am]explain just [D7]how it will make you feel
I have to pinch myself sometimes to [G]find out if it's [D7]real
{end_of_verse}

And I'm [G]back in the swing of [D7]things an amazing change takes [G]place

All the music keeps all my blues [G]away
{end_of_verse}

Now when those [C]playboys are playing
I'm [G]feeling no [Em]pain
I'm [C]right back in the [D7]swing of [G]things
