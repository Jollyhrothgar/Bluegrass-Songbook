{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I know I shouldn't love you from the way we said good[Am]bye
And I know that there are [F]others with tears for you still in their [G7]eyes
But if I thought that you were [C]lonely I wouldn't waste any [Am]time
I'd be the [F]first [G7]fool in [C]line
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Funny thing about a memory when it comes to [Am]love
It forgets about the [F]bad times and remembers what it [G7]wants
So if ever you are [C]looking for a heart whose love is [Am]blind
I'll be the [F]first [G7]fool in [C]line
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I'll fall [Am]back in[F]to your arms [C]again
Just as [Am]fast as the [F]fool I was back [G7]then
I know I should know [C]better I know the hurt I'll [Am]find
But I'll be the [F]first [G7]fool in [C]line
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I'll fall [Am]back in[F]to your arms [C]again
Just as [Am]fast as the [F]fool I was back [G7]then
So if ever you are [C]looking for a heart whose love is [Am]blind
I'll be the [F]first [G7]fool in [C]line
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I'll be the [F]first [G7]fool in [C]line
