{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Downtown tonight I saw an old friend  someone [F]who
[G7]I used to take comfort from long before I met [C]you
I caught a spark from her eyes  a [C7]forgotten [F]desire
With [G7]a word or a touch  I could have rekindled that [C]fire
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But old flames can't hold a candle to [F]you
[G7]No one can light up the night like you [C]do
Flickering embers of love I've [C7]known one or [F]two
But [G7]old flames can't hold a candle to [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Sometimes at night  I think of old lovers I've [F]known
I [G7]remember how holding them helped me not feel so [C]alone
Then I feel you beside me and even their [C7]memories are [F]gone
Like [G7]stars in the night  lost in the sweet light of [C]dawn
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But old flames can't hold a candle to [F]you

Flickering embers of love I've [C7]known one or [F]two
But [G7]old flames can't hold a candle to [C]you
