[C]My children come sit here and hold [G7]to daddy's [C]hands
[D7]For I must tell you something that I don't [G7]understand
[F]Lately we've been living in the [C]shadows of [F]surprise
[C]Since I'm not the only man [G7]in your mother's [C]eyes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G7]I can't say it's my fault and I won't say it's [C]hers
[D7]Cause I might have neglected when her need for me [G7]occurred
[F]But we're still a family and [C]must [F]realize
[C]That I'm not the only man [G7]in your mother's [C]eyes
{end_of_verse}

[F]No I'm not the [G7]only man in her [F]eyes [C]anymore
[D7]And soon she'll be leaving walking out the [G7]door
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]And things won't be easy [G7]with her not [C]around
[D7]And the shame that's now with us will be hard to live [G7]down
[F]So children bear with me [C]promise daddy you'll [F]try
[C]Since I'm not the only man [G7]in your mother's [C]eyes
[G7]Since I'm not the only man in your mother's [C][F]e-yes
{end_of_verse}
