{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I wish I had the combination
To [F]open up the secrets in your [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
To get a reading on your thoughts
Takes a chart that I have searched [F]for
But can't [C]find
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
So I [G7]rely on basic instinct to take [C]me
Where I think I need to [F]go
Why I wonder in the first [G7]place
How we ever got together I don't [C]know
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
How can the blind lead [F]the [C]blind
I wish you [F]would be so [C]kind
As to help me find a way [F]for us
That [C]I alone can't [G7]find
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Oh there has to be some answers
Somewhere in your uncharted [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
In our private times together
I have [F]wondered how well you think I'd [C]do
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Have I climbed to the mountain top
Have I [F]ever really reached up there with [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
Your beauty on the [G7]outside
[C]Suffers from the chill that's deep [F]within
And it's for that very [G7]reason
I go back to basic instinct once [C]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
So I [G7]rely on basic instinct to take [C]me
Where I think I need to [F]go
Why I wonder in the first [G7]place
How we ever got together I don't [C]know
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 9}
Oh there has to be some [G7]answers
Somewhere in your uncharted [C][F]m-ind
{end_of_verse}
