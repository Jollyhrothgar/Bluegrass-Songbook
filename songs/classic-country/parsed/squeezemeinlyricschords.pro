{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Honey I know you got a good job
You're out there making all that dough
They keep you late working that overtime
And I don't ever see you no more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]I guess you're not checking your message machine
Seems like you're never in but [C]I've got a hunch
If we can just do lunch I could get your attention again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G7]Oh I know you got your schedule and you're keeping it tight
You got something going morning noon and night
But I got something here I think you're gonna like
Honey can you squeeze me [C]in
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Yeah who[F]ever said it's a man's world
[C]Don't know what he's talking about
[F]You've got me working around the clock
[G7]Honey trying to figure you out
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I know [C]time is money but there's more to life honey
Than how much you can [F]spend
You've gotta [G7]make a little time for the good times
Honey can you squeeze me [C]in
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
I've got it circled in red on the calendar baby
You told me that tonight's the night
I've got the champagne chilled I've got a gourmet meal
Soft music and candlelight I try to [F]get you on the phone
I get stuck on hold I guess you keep getting sidetracked
I've been [C]sending you love notes all day long
But you ain't sending nothing back
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
