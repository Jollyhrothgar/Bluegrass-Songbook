[C]Not long ago you held our babies [F]bottle

Who [F]ever sets them up and tips the [C]waitress
Your kind of love just might as well be [G7]blind

And it [G7]all depends on who will buy the [C]wine
{end_of_verse}

The kind of life you live since you left [F]me
I'm [G7]sure it's not the life you thought you [C]chose
That honky tonk world is not so [F]flashy
Bright [G7]lights and booze is all it really [C]knows
