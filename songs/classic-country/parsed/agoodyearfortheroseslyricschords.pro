{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I can hardly bare the sight of lipstick
On the cigar-ettes [F]there in the [C]ashtray
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Lying cold the way you left them
At least your lips caressed [F]them while you [C]packed
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And a lip print on a half-filled cup of [F]coffee
That you poured and didn't [C]drink
But at least you thought you [G7]wanted it
That's so much more than I can say for [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
It's been a good year for the [F]roses
[G7]Many blooms still linger [C]there
The lawn could stand another [F]mowing
[G7]It's funny I don't even [C]care
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
And when you turned and walked [F]away
[G7]And as the door behind you [C][F]cl-oses 
The only thing I know to [F]say
[G7]It's been a good year for the [C]roses 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
After three full years of marriage
It's the first time that you [F]haven't made the [C]bed
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
I guess the reason we're not talking
There's so little left to [F]say we haven't [C]said
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
While a million thoughts go running through [F]my mind
I find I haven't spoke a [C]word
And from the bedroom those familiar [G7]sounds
Of our one baby's crying goes [C]unheard
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And a lip print on a half-filled cup of [F]coffee
That you poured and didn't [C]drink
But at least you thought you [G7]wanted it
That's so much more than I can say for [C]me
{end_of_verse}
