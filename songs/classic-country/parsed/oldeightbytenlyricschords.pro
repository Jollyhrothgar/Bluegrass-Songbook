[G]Well I know it ain't much but it's all that I have since she's [C]gone
One [G]black and white memory of the only love I've ever [D7]known[Am]   [D7]
One [C]moment in [G]time when [C]we were together
A [G]page from the past to haunt me forever
A constant [Am]reminder that [D7]hearts heal much slower than [G]bones

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Now my whole [Em]world's in [C]one eight by [G]ten
With [Em]four metal [Bm]walls [Em]holding it [D7]in
Through [G]one plate glass [Em]window neath the [C]blanket of [G]dust
Stands an [Em]eight by ten [D7]picture of [G]us

I [Em]wish I'd have [Bm]told her what [C]I felt [G]inside
[Em]Back when her [Bm]sweet love was [C]flowing like [D7]wine

The [Em]way that she [Bm]loved me in that [C]old eight by [D7]ten [Am]    [D7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Now the [G]silence is deafening as the day turns to [D7]dark
Her [C]presence gets [G]stronger with each [C]beat of my heart

And for a [D7]moment she's back in my [G]arms

With [Em]four metal [Bm]walls [Em]holding it [D7]in

Stands an [Em]eight by ten [D7]picture of [Em]us [C]
