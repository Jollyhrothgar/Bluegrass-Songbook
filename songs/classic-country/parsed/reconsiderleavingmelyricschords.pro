{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Why did you have to take my heart and [G7]leave me with my mind
For now I face the hardest part I worry all the [C]time
I'm driving myself crazy thinking [F]about you night and day
My [D7]mind gets filled with memories that [G7]just won't fade away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
So [C]baby maybe you could recon[G7]sider leaving me
And I promise you I'll never do you [C]wrong just wait and see
And I guarantee you'll always be the [F]only one I need
So [G7]baby maybe you could reconsider leaving [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I never knew that losing you could [G7]bring me so much pain
But since you've gone I'm all alone it's driving me in[C]sane
Everyday my skies are gray the [F]storm clouds rolling in
I [D7]know I'll never see the sun till [G7]you come home again
