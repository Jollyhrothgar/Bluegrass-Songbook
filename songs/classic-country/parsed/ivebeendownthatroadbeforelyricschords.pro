{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Now friend if you'll just listen to me 
You'll get some good hard earned [C]advice
I [D7]don't aim to meddle in your business 
I'm just tryin' to save you an awful [G]price
You see these teeth that I ain't got 
And these knots on my bald [C]head
I'll [D7]guarantee you boys I didn't get them there
A lyin' home in the [G]bed
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Now take the smart alec in any town 
Of him folks want no [C]part
He [D7]acts like his head was only made 
To hold his ears [G]apart
Now he might not like what I'm bout to say 
And my words might make him [C]sore
But [D7]I'm just tryin' to be helpful
Cause I've been down that road [G]before
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
To bully folks and play mean tricks 
Was once my pride and [C]joy
Till [D7]one day I was toted home 
And momma didn't know her little [G]boy
My head was swelled up so doggone big 
I couldn't get it through my front [C]door
Now I [D7]ain’t just talkin' to hear myself
I've been down that road [G]before
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
A little fellow about my size 
Got tired of bein' pushed [C]about
So he [D7]went to work and when he got through 
He'd knocked every one of my teeth [G]out
One time too many I'd rubbed him wrong 
And he evened up the [C]score
Now that's what [D7]happens 
When you get too big for your britches
I've been down that road [G]before
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Now when you get to thinkin' you're really smart 
There's somebody smarter than [C]you
And no [D7]matter how much you boast and brag 
You can still learn a thing or [G]two
Go get you some treatments just like I've had 
And you won't hanker for [C]more
I've really [D7]learned the meanin' of livin' and lovin'
Cause I've been down that road [G]before
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Now the man that walks this rocky road 
Usually gets just what he de[C]serves
Cause [D7]he's just a helpless servant 
To a master that he [G]serves
Now I've learned to slow my temper down 
And not to pick no scraps no [C]more
Boys it's a [D7]lot easier on the head and eyes
Cause I've been down that road [G]before
{end_of_verse}
