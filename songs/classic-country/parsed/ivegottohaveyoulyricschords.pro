{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]You came smilin' softly and you [F]moved in easy as a dreamer into [G]my world
And before I realized the [F]danger I found myself starin' [G]into your eyes
[C]Somewhere in their colors I saw promises things I've never [G]seen before
It's all [F]over  I've got to [G]have you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Holdin' on the top and sayin' [F]nothing more than a murmur I could [G]lose you
Then without a warning I [F]remember that you trembled off a [G]touch of my hand
[C]Knowing when you came to me 
That no one else would ever feel the [G]same in my arms
It's all [F]over  I've got to [G]have you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]Wakin' in the mornin' to the tenderness of holding you [G]asleep in my arms
[C]Dreaming while your hair was blowing softer than the whisper on my [G]cheek
[C]I don't know the feelings so I don't know if it's love 
But it's [G]enough it's enough
It's all [F]over  I've got to [G]have you 
I just can't [F]help it no I've got to [G]have you
{end_of_verse}
