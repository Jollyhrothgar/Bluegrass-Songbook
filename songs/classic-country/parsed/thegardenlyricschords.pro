{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]She planted roses the first year we [F]married
It soon [C]was a garden we'd go walking [G7]through 
My job kept me traveling [C]but when I came home to [F]heaven  
She was [C]so proud to show me all the love [G7]that she [C]grew 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I heard her talking one day to an old [F]friend
She said I [C]don't want to hurt him but it's out of [G7]control 
I [C]feel so guilty cause [F]he'll be so [C]helpless   
He won't understand [G7]why I've just got to [C]go 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now I come to the garden alone
All my [F]reasons I once had for living are [C]gone
Sometimes when I [E7]feel like I [F]just 
Can't go [D7]on I [C]come to the [G7]garden [C]alone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
No one can imagine just how much I miss [F]her 
I'd give [C]up this whole world to once more hold her [G7]near
It's just [C]beyond me why God took her from [F]me  
I bet the [C]flowers in heaven are looking [G7]better this [C]year 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Now I come to the garden alone
Where the [F]dew kissed the roses where weeds now have [C]grown
Sometimes when I [E7]feel like I [F]just 
Can't go [D7]on I [C]come to the [G7]garden [C]alone
{end_of_verse}
