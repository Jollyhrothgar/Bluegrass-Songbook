{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I'm late again forgot [C]their names when nights were [D7]though
Kept the [C]upper hand [Am]always planning my next [D7]move
I [G]thought she'd be nothing more to me than a one [C]night [Am]romance
But I was [G]caught off guard well it's [D7]so hard I never stood [C]a [G]chance
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]When she touches [D7]me I loose [C]control 
And [D7]her love takes [C]complete [G]command
[C]When she touches [D7]me my heart lets [C]go 
And I [Am]throw all caution to the [D7]wind
I can [G]keep my cool be nobody's fool till I [C]h-old [Am]her
But when she [G]touches me [D7]it's all [G][C]o-v-er
{end_of_verse}

I must be insane [C]I can't explain the things I [D7]do
Calling day [C]and night just [Am]dropping by and being [D7]true
The [G]final step is finding myself [C]dying for her [Am]kiss
Oh her [G]love's so good and I [D7]think I could get used [C]to [G]this
