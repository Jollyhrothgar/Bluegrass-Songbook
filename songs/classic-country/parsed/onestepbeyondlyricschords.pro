{meta: artist Willie Nelson}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I'm just one step before losing you
And I'm [F]just one step ahead of the [C]blues
But I know that there's been pain and misery
[D7]Long before this old world ever heard of [G7]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]It will hurt so much to see you go
[F]But we'll just add one more heartache to the [C]score
And [F]though I still love you as [C]before
I'm [G7]just one step beyond caring any[C]more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Yes bet that you're surprised that I could feel this way
[F]After staying home and waiting night and [C]day
For someone who cared so much for me
You'd come [D7]home just long enough to laugh at [G7]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]I don't know just when my feelings changed
I [F]just know I could never feel the [C]same
And [F]though I still love you as [C]before
I'm [G7]just one step beyond caring any[C]more
{end_of_verse}
