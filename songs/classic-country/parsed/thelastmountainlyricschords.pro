{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I've climbed a lot of hills
[F]Walked some lonely [C]valleys
I've seen times the sun just wouldn't [G7]shine 
But to[C]day as I was struggling 
The [F]good Lord said to [C]me
This is the last mountain you'll [G7]ever have to [C]climb
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I'm [F]climbing the last [C]mountain
Soon I'll reach the end of the [G7]line
Like [C]Moses of old when he [F]stood Mount [C]Nebo 
This is the last mountain that I'll [G7]ever have to [C]climb
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I know there'll be joy 
I [F]know there'll be [C]singing
When at last I view the promised [G7]land
He'll [C]hold my trembling hands 
[F]Every joy will all be [C]mine
This is the last mountain that I'll [G7]ever have to [C]climb
{end_of_verse}
