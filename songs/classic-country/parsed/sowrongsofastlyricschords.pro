{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]As I sit here alone and in [F]silence 
[G7]Reliving each day of the [C]past
I'm searching my life for one [F]answer 
How [G7]things went so wrong so [C]fast
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Don't [G7]tell me that it is all [C]over 
For [G7]if I was wrong in the [C]past
I'll [F]help build the brand new [C]tomorrow 
That [G7]won't go so wrong so [C]fast
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
We lived every day for each [F]other 
No [G7]love was more certain to [C]last
But somewhere and somehow it [F]wavered 
Then [G7]things went so wrong so [C]fast
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
The little mistakes we'd [F]forgotten 
The [G7]carelessly marks that were [C]cast
All came back in one angry [F]moment 
And [G7]things went so wrong so [C]fast
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Don't [G7]tell me that it is all [C]over 
For [G7]if I was wrong in the [C]past
I'll [F]help build the brand new [C]tomorrow 
That [G7]won't go so wrong so [C]fast
{end_of_verse}
