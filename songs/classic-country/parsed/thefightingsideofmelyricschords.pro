{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I hear people talking bad
About the way we have to live here in this [D7]country
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Harping on the wars we fight
And griping about the way things oughta [G]be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And I don't mind 'em switching sides
And standing up for things they believe [D7]in
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
When they're running down my country man
They're walking on the fighting side of [G]me

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[D7]Yeah they're [G]walking on the fighting side of [D7]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Running down the way of life
Our fighting men have [C]fought and died to [G]keep
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
If you don't love it leave it
Let this song I'm singing be a [C][G7]warning
If you're running down my country [D7]man
You're walking on the fighting side of [G]me 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
I read about some squirrelly guy
Who claims he just don't believe in [D7]fighting
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 9}
And I wonder just how long
The rest of us can count on being [G]free
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 10}
They love our milk and honey
But they preach about some other way of [D7]living
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 11}
When they're running down my country hoss
They're walking on the fighting side of [G]me 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And I don't mind 'em switching sides
And standing up for things they believe [D7]in
{end_of_verse}
