[C]There goes an old love the [G7]keeper of my [C]heart

She wanted riches [G7]diamonds and [C]gold
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I taught her to love and she [G7]taught me to [C]cry
Then I learned to smile with a [G7]tear in my [C]eye
I offered her [C7]true love as [F]long as I [C]live
But she wanted more than a [G7]poor boy could [C]give
Yes she wanted more than a [G7]poor boy could [C]give

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
She seems to be so happy in that big [G7]house on the [C]hill
She pretends that she don't know me [G7]but I love her [C]still
Without her [C7]love I've no [F]reason left to [C]live
She wanted more than a [G7]poor boy could [C]give
Yes she wanted more than a [G7]poor boy could [C]give
