[C]Don’t tell me what I [A]already know is [C]true
Let me [F]continue on [C]believing [D7]exactly what I [G7]want to
You always [C]paint such pretty [A]pictures with your [C]lies
But of all the [F]pictures ‘round your [C]heart
Won’t let me [Dm]see [G7]beyond your [C]eyes

The first [G7]picture that you painted

The [D7]others are just pretty lies 
And [G7]stories you have told

But of all the [F]pictures ‘round your [C]heart
Won’t let me [Dm]see [G7]beyond your [C]eyes
