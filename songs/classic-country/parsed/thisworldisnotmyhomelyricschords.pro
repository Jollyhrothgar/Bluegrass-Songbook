{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]This world is not my home I'm just [F]a passing [C]through
My treasures are laid up [D7]somewhere beyond the [G7]blue
The [C]angels beckon me [F]from heaven's open [C]door
And I can't feel at home in this [G7]world [C]anymore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh Lord you know I [F]have no friend like [C]you
If heaven's not my home then [D7]Lord what will I [G7]do
The [C]angels beckon me from [F]heaven's open [C]door
And I can't feel at home in this [G7]world [C]anymore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I have a loving mother just [F]over in Glory [C]land
And I don't expect to stop [D7]until I shake her [G7]hand
She's [C]waiting now for me in [F]heaven's open [C]door
And I can't feel at home in this [G7]world [C]anymore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Just over in Glory land we'll [F]live [C]eternally 
The saints on every hand are [D7]shouting [G7]victory
Their [C]songs of sweetest praise [F]drift back from heaven's [C]shore
And I can't feel at home in this [G7]world [C]anymore
{end_of_verse}
