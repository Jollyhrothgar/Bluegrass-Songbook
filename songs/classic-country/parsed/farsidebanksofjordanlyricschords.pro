{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I believe my steps are growing wearier each [D7]day

Lures of this old world have ceased to make me want to [D7]stay
And my one regret is leaving you [G]behind

But if it proves to be his will that I am first to [D7]go
And somehow I’ve a feeling it will [G]be
When it comes your time to travel likewise don’t you feel [D7]lost
For I will be the first one that you [G]see

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And I’ll be waiting on the far side banks of [G]Jordan
I’ll be [C]waiting drawing pictures in the [G]sand
And [D7]when I see you coming I will rise up with a [G]shout
And come [C]running through the [G]shallow waters [D7]reaching for your [G]hand
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Through this life we have labored hard to earn our meager [D7]fare
It’s brought us trembling hands and failing [G]eyes
I’ll just rest here on the shore and turn my eyes [D7]away
Until you come and then we’ll see [G]paradise
{end_of_verse}

And come [C]running through the [G]shallow waters [D7]reaching for your [G]hand
