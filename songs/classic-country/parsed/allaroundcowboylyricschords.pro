[G]Well all around cowboy I've won it six years in [D7]a row
All around cowboy means champ of the big [G]rodeo
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I've made me some money I've had me some good times
The falls that I've had have been [C]few
Till [D7]the rodeo queen made the all around cowboy 
Look like an all around [G]fool
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I was the cowboy who said he would never [D7]be roped
I even bragged how I'd never be branded [G]or broke
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I was doing quite well till a blond little filly
Rode into my life like [C]a dream
And [D7]the all around cowboy fell head over heels
In love with the rodeo [G]queen
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
The [C]moment I looked in her blue eyes I knew I [D7]was gone
I [C]tried to hide them but the feelings I had were [D7]to strong
She showed [G]the world what an all around cowboy could do    [C]D7                                                             
She showed the world how an all around cowboy
Could look like an all around [G]fool
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
She made you feel like a horse without [D7]any fire
To late I realized breaking me was her [G]desire
She rode me and raked me with spurs that lessened the [C]hurt
She left [D7]me broken and she left me crying 
Out there in the rodeo [G]dirt
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I was the cowboy who said he would never [D7]be roped
I even bragged how I'd never be branded [G]or broke
{end_of_verse}
