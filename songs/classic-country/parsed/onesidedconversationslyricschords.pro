{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]If I must live alone I'd [C]rather do it by my[G]self [C]  [G]  [C]
For I've [G]never known a [D7]mirror to [Em]shake its head 
And [D7]turn and walk [A7]away [D7]
And [G]looking at myself and [C]all the things that I be[G]lieve in[C]  [G]  [C]
Left [G]dying in the silence [D7]of the things you never [G]say [C]  [G]  [C]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And [G]sleeping by myself [C]somehow I never [G]held you[C]  [G]  [C]
Oh I [G]wish I'd knew the [D7]reason cause [Em]surely 
There's an [G]answer to it [A7]all  [D7]
[G]Talking to myself and [C]something else that I've grown [G]used to[C]  [G]  [C]
One [G]sided conversations [D7]with a narrow minded [G]wall [C]  [G]  [C]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G]Talk to me oh [C]can't you see
That I can't [G]bear to give my [D7]dream to some[Em]one
Who would stand and let it [D7]fall
[G]Vision to myself I'm the [C]only one that [G]holds me [C]  [G]  [C]
And [G]one sided conversations [D7]with a narrow minded [G]wall[C]  [G]  [C]
And one [G]sided conversations [D7]with a narrow minded [Em]wall[G]  [C]  [G]
{end_of_verse}
