[G]It's time to leave so let me go [C]I've just been wasting [G]time
I'll [A7]call you in a year or so [D7]if I can [C]spare a [D7]dime
We [G]couldn't change the bad to good [C]the good Lord knows we [G]tried
And a [A7]one way love just ain't no good [D7]and I can't [C]live a [G]lie
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
So I'll just hit the road a cryin' low
I'll walk so fast you'll never know
I'm [D7]cryin' and dyin'
Before one teardrop hits the ground
I'll be halfway across this town and [G]gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Perhaps in time the hurt will heal [C]if I just walk [G]away
I [A7]love you so I hate to go [D7]but there's [C]no other [G]way
