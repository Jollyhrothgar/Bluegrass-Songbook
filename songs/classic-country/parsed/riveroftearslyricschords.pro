{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]If it takes a million tears to start a [F]river
Then to[G7]morrow a new stream will [C]flow
It will start from my eyes
A thousand [F]tears for each goodbye
And a [G7]million more because I miss you [C]so
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Every [G7]tear that goes in this [C]river
Will [D7]represent a pain in my [G7]heart
And each [C]time you make me blue
This [F]stream will change its view
And [G7]flow on just as far as we're [C]apart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
If I could recall every [F]promise
You [G7]made through the hours we once [C]knew
The love we sealed in each heart
No [F]tears could tear apart
And the [G7]strongest river never could flow [C]through
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
But to[G7]morrow the tears will be [C]falling
Cause to[D7]morrow will be like yester[G7]day
If it [C]takes a million tears to start a [F]river
Then a [G7]million tears will soon be on their [C]way
{end_of_verse}
