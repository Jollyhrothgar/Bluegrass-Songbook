[C]Soft rain was falling when you told me [F]goodbye

And the [G7]soft rain was teardrops for the angels all [C]cried

If [G7]love can be perfect ours must have [C]been
But [G7]perfection is always destroyed by [C]men

And the [G7]soft rain was teardrops for the angels all [C]cried
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The rain started falling when you told me [F]goodbye

The sky that was bright blue turned slowly to [F]grey
And the [G7]angels cried with me as you walked [C]away
