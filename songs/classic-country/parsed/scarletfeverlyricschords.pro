{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I stood outside the Lucky Star staring at the flashing sign
It read [F]come on in and watch young Scarlet's body come [C]alive
Let her dance [F]for you and cast her [G7]spell
You'll [C]swear you can believe [F]her
Be careful not to catch the scarlet [G7]fever
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
So I paid my fare and walked down front and found an [C]empty chair
As I [F]settled in young scarlet took the ribbons from her [C]hair
The moves her body [F]made while the music [G7]played
Were the [C]likes I've never [F]seen
And she became the envy [G7]of my [C]dreams
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
One by one her teasing movements brought the crowd out of their seats
And [F]all at once young scarlet danced right up in front of [C]me
From the moment [F]that her eyes found [G7]mine
I've [C]never been the [F]same
Scarlet locked another [G7]heart upon her [C]chain
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Now I get scarlet [F]fe-v-er [G7]every time I see [C]her 
[F]But she's a night club [Dm]teaser
[G7]Not paid to notice [C]me yes I get scarlet [G7][F]fe-v-er
If she knew how much I need [C]her 
She'd [F]place her hand in my [Dm]hand and [G7]dance away with [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
She looked 25 but I was told that she was just 16
She had a way [F]of making a man believe she danced for only [C]him
As [F]she tantalized I [G7]fantasized
And [C]felt the sound of my heart [F]beat
And every night I'd dream she'd [G7]fall in love with [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Then one night while driving in my eyes begun to tear
Cause the sign [F]outside the Lucky Star said Scarlet isn't [C]here
She'd [F]left that day to find a [G7]life
Of [C]bigger and better [F]things
And she left behind my [G7]chain of broken [C]dreams
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
But still get scarlet [G7][F]fe-v-er 
In my mind I still see [C]her
[F]Out there dancing somewhere
[G7]To another fool like [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
Yes I get scarlet [G7][F]fe-v-er
If she knew how much I need [C]her 
She'd [F]place her hand in my hand and [G7]dance away with [C]me
{end_of_verse}
