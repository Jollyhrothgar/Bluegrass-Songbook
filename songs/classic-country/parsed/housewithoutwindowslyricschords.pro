{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I'm gonna [G7]move into a house without [C]windows 
So I won't see you [Am]walking by walking by [F]
[Dm]With your new [G7]love 
There in the darkness of my house without [C]windows 
I will never see the [Am]stars that shine shine on you[F]
[Dm]And your new [G7]love 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I'd rather [F]wander through this endless [Em]night 
Than to face the [F]light of another lonely [Dm]day 
Knowing that you won't be [Em]there 
There to [D]share these two [Dm]arms ever [G7]again 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I'll take my broken heart 
And I'll take all my [C]broken dreams
And from now on you will [Am]find me there 
Crying there trying to [G7]forget
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
In my house without [C]windows
In my house without [F]windows
In my house without [C]love
In my house without windows
In my house without [F]windows
And without [C]love[Am]   [C]
{end_of_verse}
