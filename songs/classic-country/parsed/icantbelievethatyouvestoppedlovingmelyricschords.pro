[C]Tomorrow I'll say Happy [F]Birthday [C]darling
And surprise you with a gift when I come [G7]home
Then [C]my forgetful arms [F]will reach out for [C]you
I can't [D7]forget you just because you're [G7]gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I can't [C]believe that [F]you stopped loving [C]me
It's too [G7]much for me to [C]understand
How can anything so [F]real become a [C]dream
I can't believe that [G7]you've stopped loving [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I sifted all the [F]reasons why you left [C]me
And I've gone back and relived all the love we [G7]had
For [C]every tear we lost I [F]found a thousand [C]smiles
And the [D7]good times always outweighed the [G7]bad
{end_of_verse}
