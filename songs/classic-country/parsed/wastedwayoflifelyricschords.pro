{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Don't tempt me if I should pass your [F]door
You'd hide your [G7]heart if you knew what was in [C]store
Just [F]pain and misery is all you'd [C]ever find with me
A [G7]wasted way of life nothing [C]more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
My [F]wasted way of life is filled with [C]sorrow and strife
I take no vows when I do my one man [G7]show
Like [F]good friends in the snow
The tracks I [C]made fade as I go
Just a [G7]wasted way of life is all I [C]know
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The swinging door in my heart will never [F]close
One walks [G7]in one walks out that's how it [C]goes
If [F]you should pass through just [C]remember as you do
There'll be [G7]someone close behind pushing [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
My [F]wasted way of life is filled with [C]sorrow and strife
I take no vows when I do my one man [G7]show
Like [F]good friends in the snow
The tracks I [C]made fade as I go
Just a [G7]wasted way of life is all I [C]know
{end_of_verse}
