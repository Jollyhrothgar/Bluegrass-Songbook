{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[Am]When I want to drop out of [C]reality I cop out
To the [Dm]memories of [E7]things that you and I [Am]did[E7]
My [Am]mind is a proj[E7]ection as I [C]gaze in recollection
At the [Dm]Cinerama [E7]screen inside my [Am]eyelids
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And [F]visions of [C]sugar plumbs [F]race through my [C]head
You and [F]I drinking [G7]yesterday's [C]wine
But [F]soon the morning sun of [C]today will touch my [Dm]bed
And [F]burst the pretty [G7]bubble in my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[Am]Now my eyes are open remi[C]niscing dreams are broken
By the [Dm]lips of one [E7]mistake I made a while [Am]bac[E7]k
For [Am]I chose her in [E7]place of you so when I need a [C]taste of you
I [Dm]look into my [E7]mind and see you [Am]smile back
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
And [F]visions of [C]sugar plumbs [F]race through my [C]head
You and [F]I drinking [G7]yesterday's [C]wine
But [F]soon the morning sun of [C]today will touch my [Dm]bed
And [F]burst the pretty [G7]bubble in my [C]mind
