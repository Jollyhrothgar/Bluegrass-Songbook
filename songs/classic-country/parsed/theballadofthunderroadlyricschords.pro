[G7]He'd go by like they were standing still on thunder [C]road

And [F]there was thunder thunder over thunder [C]road
[G7]Thunder was his engine and white lightning was his [C]load

Your [G7]tank is filled with hundred-proof you're all tuned up and [C]gassed

I'd [G7]rather have you back again than all that mountain [C]dew

He [G7]shot the gap at Cumberland and screamed by [C]Maynardville

The [G7]mountain boy took roads that even angels feared to [C]tread
