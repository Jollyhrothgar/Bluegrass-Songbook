[C]Steps 1 and 2 [F]steps 3 and 4
[G7]And each day I love you [C]more (I love you more)
Steps are often taken [F]I took 1 and 2
[G7]Now I'm so much closer closer to [C]you
Everyone I talk to [F]knows about you
And this [G7]old heart of mine keeps saying
I want to know her [C]too

[F]What's this [G7]world coming [C]to
[F]Could it [G7]be that I love [C]you
I've taken steps 3 and 4
And [F]why I'll never know
My [G7]path is set my minds made up
I just knocked upon your [C]door

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Steps 1 and 2 [F]steps 3 and 4
[G7]And each day I love you [C]more (I love you more)

I [G7]want you now I need you now
For else I'll lose my [C]mind

To Little Joe that's where I'll go
I [F]know I'll find you there
I'll [G7]take his wine to ease my mind
[F]Imagine your [G7]lips next to [C]mine

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]What's this [G7]world coming [C]to
[F]Could it [G7]be that I love [C]you
I've taken steps 3 and 4
And [F]why I'll never know
My [G7]path is set my minds made up
I just knocked upon your [C]door
