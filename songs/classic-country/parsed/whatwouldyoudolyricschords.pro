{meta: title What Would You Do}
{meta: artist Jim Reeves}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]You call me a cheater well maybe that's [F]true
But [G7]if you could hold heaven what would you [C]do
She offered me true love that I never [F]knew
I [G7]saw the doors to heaven and just walked [C]through
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You'll never believe me I tried to be [F]true
But with [G7]heaven at my fingertips what else could I [C]do
Maybe you'd be different if this happened to [F]you
But [G7]with your feet in my shoes I wonder what you'd [C]do
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
If it's wrong to long for lost love then I'm wrong as I can [F]be
You [G7]say it's wrong and that may be true but it sure seems right to [C]me
And you say you'd be different if this happened to [F]you
But with [G7]heaven at your fingertips what would you [C]do
{end_of_verse}
