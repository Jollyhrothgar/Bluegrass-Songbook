{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]My grandparents came here [F]from Yell Arkan[C]sas
They built them a soddie [D7]on the Sulphur Springs [G7]draw
[C]Scratched out a living for a [F]family of [Em]ten
With a [C]faith that was strong [G7]as the panhandle [C]wind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
All those tall Texas tales Grandpa [F]passed down to [C]me
Are still just as vivid as [D7]when I sat on his [G7]knee
[C]But what I remember about the [F]tales he would [Em]spin
Is [C]how he would cuss that [G7]blamed panhandle [C]wind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
It [F]taught the coyote to howl makes the tumbleweeds [C]roll
It controlled the migration [D7]of the great buffa[G7]lo
Makes the [F]salt cedar sing and the cottonwood [Em]bend
Your [C]constant companion [G7]is the panhandle [C]wind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
It sweeps off the Rockies like [F]a fast movin' [C]train
Brings a sky full of dust [D7]and a few drops of [G7]rain
It [C]usually blows from the North but [F]it's subject to [Em]change
As [C]it sculpts the face [G7]of the panhandle [C]plains
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
It just took my hat off and [F]blowed it a [C]mile
I broke out a cussin' [D7]and I managed to [G7]smile
I'd [C]rather be here than any [F]place I have [Em]been
But [C]I'll never get used to [G7]this panhandle [C]wind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
It [F]taught the coyote to howl makes the tumbleweeds [C]roll

You never get used to [G7]this panhandle [C]wind
