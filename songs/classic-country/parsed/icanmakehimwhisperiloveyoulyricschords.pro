{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Lately I have [C]caught myself still [G]thinking
[C]Of someone that I haven’t seen in [D7]years
[G]I lose myself in my [G][C]imagination
[C]And pretty soon I find myself in [D7]tears
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G]Funny how a [C]gal goes right on [G]hoping
[C]Even after years of hope is [D7]gone
[C]I know by now I’ve faded from his [G]memory
[C]But in my heart his memory’s still so [D7]strong
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G]I can tell myself that [C]he still thinks about [G]me
[C]And find some comfort thinking that it’s [G]true
[C]Right here within my own [G]imagination
[C]I can make him [D7]whisper I love [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]After all this time I should be [G]over
[C]The heartaches that one time caused such [D7]pain
[G]And by this time I [C]should have found a new [G]love
[C]But years have not extinguished all the [D7]flames
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[G]So I’ll go right on [C]living with his [G]memory
[C]Even if it’s just for my hearts [D7]sake
[C]For as long as I have my [G]imagination
[C]I’ve got a hope that no one else can [D7]take
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G]I can tell myself that [C]he still thinks about [G]me

[C]Right here within my own [G]imagination
[C]I can make him [D7]whisper I love [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
