[G]People keep asking and [C]wondering [G]why
There’s always a [D7]tear in your [G]eye
You’ve lived a hard life one I’d [C]rather not [G]lead
I ought to be [D7]glad it’s not [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But when [C]tears fill your eyes and [G]clouds hide the sky
Your [C]heart is so sad and you [G]have a worried [D7]mind
You’ll [G]know my heart is with you 
And my [C]love for you ain’t [G]blind
Your worries and [D7]troubles are [G]mine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now the nights are hard to get through as [C]I wait restless[G]ly
My letters are [D7]written in [G]vain
Unsure of your feelings my [C]tears fall endless[G]ly
And my heart’s beating [D7]rhythm with the [G]rain
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
But when [C]tears fill your eyes and [G]clouds hide the sky
Your [C]heart is so sad and you [G]have a worried [D7]mind

And my [C]love for you ain’t [G]blind
Your worries and [D7]troubles are [G]mine
