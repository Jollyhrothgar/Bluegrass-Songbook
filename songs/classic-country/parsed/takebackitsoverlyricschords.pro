{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I’m the one and [C]only one to [G]blame
Cause when love’s [C]fire was [G]burning [C]low I [G]didn't fan the [D7]flame
[G]Now I’d gladly walk across [C]hell itself on a [G]single piece of [C]bread
If only [G]you’d take [C]back it’s [G]over and [D7]say we’ll try again [G]instead
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You’re the one and [C]only place I [G]want to be
Forget those [C]crazy [G]things I [C]said this [G]freedom’s killing [D7]me
[G]I’d gladly be a [C]beggar with a [G]sidewalk for my [C]bed
If only [G]you’d take [C]back it’s [G]over and [D7]say we’ll try again [G]instead
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Take back it’s [C]over and say we’ll [D7]try to try [G]again
We’ve [C]loved each other too [Em]much and too long to [A7]try to be just [D7]friends
[G]Now I’d gladly walk across [C]hell itself on a [G]single piece of [C]bread
If only [G]you’d take [C]back it’s [G]over and [D7]say we’ll try again [G]instead
If only you’d take [C]back it’s [G]over and [D7]say we’ll try again [C]in-stea[G]d
{end_of_verse}
