{meta: artist Hank Williams}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]You will meet many just like [D7]me upon [G]life’s busy street
With shoulders stooped and heads bowed [C]low and eyes that stare in [G]defeat
For souls that live within the past where [C]sorrow plays all parts
For a [G]living death is all that’s [D7]left for men with broken [G]hearts
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You have no right to be the [D7]judge to criti[G]cize and condemn
Just think but for the grace of [C]God it would be [G]you instead of him
One careless step a thoughtless deed and [C]then the misery starts 
And to those [G]who weep [D7]death comes cheap [G]these men with broken hearts
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Humble you should [D7]be when they come passing [G]by 
For its written that the greatest of [C]men never get to [G]big to cry
Some lose faith in love and life [C]when sorrow shoots her darts 
And with hope all [G]gone [D7]they walk alone [G]these men with broken hearts
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
You've never walked in that [D7]man's shoes or saw things through his [G]eyes
Or stood and watched with helpless hands [C]while the heart inside you [G]dies
Some were paupers some were kings [C]some were masters of the arts 
But in their [G]shame they're [D7]all the same [G]these men with broken hearts
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Life sometimes can be so [D7]cruel that a [G]heart will pray for death
[C]God why must these living dead know pain with every [G]breath 
So help your brother along the road [C]no matter where he starts
For the God that made [G]you made them [D7]too [G]these men [C]with broken [G]hearts 
{end_of_verse}
