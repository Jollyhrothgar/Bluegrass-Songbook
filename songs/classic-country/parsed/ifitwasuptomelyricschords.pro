[G]All our friends are [D7]asking me [G]about you

And move the highest [G]mountain just to see
[F]Your loving [C]smile a[G]gain
If [C]it was up to me
I'd turn the hands of time back  
To the [G]way we used to be
And we'd be [D7]one again if it was up to [G]me [C]

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
They [G]ask me when [D7]we're gettin' back to[G]gether
[D7]They don't know it's all out of my [G]hands

Any [G]more than I can [D7]help the way I [G]am
{end_of_verse}
