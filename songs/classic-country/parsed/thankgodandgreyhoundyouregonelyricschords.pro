[C]I've made a small fortune and you [C7]squandered it [F]all
You shamed me till [C]I feel about one inch [G7]tall
But I [C]thought I loved you and I hoped [C7]you would [F]change
So I gritted my [C]teeth and [G7]didn't [C]complain
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Now you come to me with a [C7]simple [F]goodbye
You tell me you're [C]leaving but you don't tell me [G7]why
Now we're [C]here at the station and [C7]you're getting [F]on
And all I can think of [C]is 
Thank [G7]God and Greyhound you're [C]gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Thank God and Greyhound you're [F]gone
I didn't know how much longer I could go [G7]on
Watching you take the respect out [C]of me
[F]Watching you make a total wreck out of [G7]me
That [C]big diesel motor is a [F]playing my [C]song
Thank God and [G7]Greyhound you're [C]gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Thank God and Greyhound you're [F]gone
That load on my mind got lighter when you got [G7]on
That shiny old bus is a beautiful [C]sight
[F]With the black smoke a-rolling up around the tail [G7]light
It [C]may sound kinda cruel but I've been [F]silent too [C]long
Thank God and [G7]Greyhound you're [C]gone
