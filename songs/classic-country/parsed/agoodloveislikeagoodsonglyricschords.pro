[G7]I was a lonely soul no [F]voice in the [C]crowd
[F]Just whispering [C]sadly with my [G7]head always bowed
I hadn't anything of [F]which to be [C]proud
[D7]And then I saw you and my [G7]heart sang out loud

Oh a [C]good love is like a good song
It grows [F]on you till it's so [C]strong
It never leaves you it never [G7]goes wrong
You know a [F]good [C]love is like a [G7]good [C]song
{end_of_verse}

[G7]We introduced ourselves my [F]heart simply [C]soared

We listened to the [F]rain as it [C]poured
[D7]And I heard the echo of an [G7]ol' familiar chord
