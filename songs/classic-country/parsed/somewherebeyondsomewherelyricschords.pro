{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]As daylight was dawning I woke up this morning
Still feeling the pain from last [G7]night
And the dream of a woman with a beckoning body
Another dream that didn’t turn out [C]right
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I’ve had many dreams and tried many schemes 
That keeps dying [C7]as I’m trying to [F]win
With no [G7]feel of belonging once more this morning
I woke up in nowhere [C]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]Somewhere beyond nowhere there’s somewhere I wish I could [C]find
I keep combing the beaches searching the reaches of my [G7]mind
Is the [C]answer’s within me wish someone [C7]would show me a [F]sign
And [G7]point me to somewhere so I could be nowhere [C]behind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Back alley’s are gloomy the city park’s roomy
I’ve tried to sleep there [G7]before  
But the benches are hard and they don’t have the contours   
And a body wakes up stiff and [C]sore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
So I sleep where I can with the darkness at hand
Whispering the [C7]mysteries of [F]time 
Is there [G7]hope in the future with someone who will care
And somewhere a place I can [C]find
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]Somewhere beyond nowhere there’s somewhere I wish I could [C]find
I keep combing the beaches searching the reaches of my [G7]mind
Is the [C]answer’s within me wish someone [C7]would show me a [F]sign
And [G7]point me to somewhere so I could be nowhere [C]behind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
And [G7]point me to somewhere so I could be nowhere [C]behind
{end_of_verse}
