{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Every jukebox that I see holds a memory for [C]me
[D7]And I cry along with every tune I [G]play
[C]My radio is always on I know the words to every song
[D7]But I still can't seem to cry him [G]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]I keep asking myself why can't I just lay down and die
[D7]I don't really think there's any other [G]way
[C]I go to my lonely room and I cry there in the gloom
[D7]But I still can't seem to cry him [G]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]I can't cry him away [D7]I see him [G]everywhere
[A7]Though the pillow here beside me's empty his memory is [D7]there
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[G]I sometimes wake up with the dawn and my radio is [C]on
[D7]And I didn't even hear the tunes they [G]played
[C]So I turn it way up high so no one can hear me cry
[D7]For I know I'll never cry him [G]away
{end_of_verse}

[D7]But I still can't seem to cry him [G]away
