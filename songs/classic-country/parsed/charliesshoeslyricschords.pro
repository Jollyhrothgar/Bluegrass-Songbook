{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I'd like to be in Charlie's [C7]shoes   that's what I always [F]said
Cause [G7]he had you and every-thing  tied with a golden [C]thread
Then Charlie left and went away  [C7]and when I got the [F]news
It [G7]wasn't long till I was walking round in Charlie's [C]shoes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Now I'm wearing out the [C7]shoes that Charlie [F]wore
[G7]Walking back and forth across the [C]floor
The troubles that drove him away [C7]I've got for [F]company
These [G7]nights in Charlie's shoes are killing [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The greener grass that turned my head [C7]so swiftly did turn [F]brown
Cause [G7]every little dream I built   she's always tearing [C]down
I never knew old Charlie's [C7]shoes   could have so many [F]tacks
Of [G7]disappointing sorrows and I wish   he had them [C]back
