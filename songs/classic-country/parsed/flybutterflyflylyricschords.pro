[C]When you were [F]only five [G7]you caught a [C]butterfly
You held it [F]for a while it [C]made you smile [G7]you caught a butter[C]fly
Finally it [F]flew away [G7]you cried and [C]cried that day
To see it [F]fly so high [C]an eagle came [G7]and caught the butter[C]fly

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
So don't [G7]fly too high in the [C]sky butterfly
If you [G7]fly very high in the sky you'll find the sun may [C]burn your wings
And each [G7]song you hear let it [C]go in and out your ear
Don't be [G7]fooled by the beautiful songs the night birds [C]sing
{end_of_verse}

Your daddy [F]loves you best [G7]much more than [C]all the rest
I watched you [F]grow to be a [C]lady fair [G7]you’ve been my butter[C]fly
Learn to fly [F]butterfly [G7]before you [C]fly too high
An eagle [F]waits for you [C]watch what you do [G7]be careful butter[C]fly
