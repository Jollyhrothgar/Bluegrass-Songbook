{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I lost count of the hours and I've lost track of the days
[F]In fact I've lost just about everything since you went away
[C]Everything that is except the memories you left me
[G7]And that's one thing no man can ever mar
[C]I don't know who you're with I don't even know where you are
[F]My only hope is that someday you might hear this song
[C]And you'll know I wrote it especially for you
[G7]And I love you wherever you [C]are

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Spoken:
This flame in my heart is like a torch of fire
[F]For everyday it burns hotter and everyday it burns brighter
[C]And I haven't been able to put out one little flicker
[G7]Not even with all of these tears
[C]My friends say I'm crazy  and  maybe I am
But I'll carry this torch just as long [F]as I can
For someday you just might decide to [C]come home
[G7]And I want you to know I'm still [C]here
