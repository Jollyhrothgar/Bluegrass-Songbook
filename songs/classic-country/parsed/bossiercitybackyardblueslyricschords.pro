[C]I got these achin' Bossier City backyard blues
Been rollin' cigarettes with holes in both my [G7]shoes
Tryin' to [C]write a song that fits just me and [F]you
I got these [C]achin' Bossier [G7]City backyard [C]blues

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
This is just the song to try and check my wit

I could write a song about my buddy Tom
But he'd probably write a song about a line that I used [G7]wrong
His [C]dictation and his grammar are the [F]best
And the [C]world will never [G7]let a genius [C]rest

Try these [C]achin' Bossier [G7]City backyard [C]blues
