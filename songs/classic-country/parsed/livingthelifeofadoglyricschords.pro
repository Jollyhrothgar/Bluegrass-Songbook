{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I came home last night just a little [F]late
I [G7]opened the door and she hit me with my supper [C]plate
Can't see a whole lot through these two black [F]eyes
But I could [G7]see enough to know
I was sleeping with the dog [C]tonight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Yeah I'm living the life of a [F]dog
I [G7]get down on all fours when I [C]walk
Scratching flees and sleeping on the ground
[F]Running with the coldest noses in town
I'm [G7]living the life of a [C]dog
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well I built me a little bitty house way out [F]back
I had [G7]all intentions of using it before I [C]passed
But I've been in the dog house so many times
I [F]started to chasing cars 
And when you [G7]wrote my name on the pole baby 
That's going just a little too [C]far
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Well this dog business is gettin' out of [F]hand
Why that [G7]woman's forgot that I'm really a [C]man
Well I was upon the couch a scratching
I fell [F]off and I hurt my neck
She [G7]loaded me up in the back of the truck
Said she was taking me to the [C]vet
{end_of_verse}
