{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]It was just some boards of rough cut pine 
And a quilt of patch work [G]cotton
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
A place to lay your body down
Was that [D7]big four poster [G]bed
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Daddy built it out of pine
Two [C]days before the [G]wedding
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
They say the neighbors cheered and hollered
[A7]Till his face got [D7]red
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
And Mama brought the feather [G]pillows 
[C]And some handmade [G]bedding
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
And they spent their wedding night
In that [D7]big four poster [G]bed
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
That night they swore like that bed
Their [C]love would last [G]forever
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
And they'd ask no more of life
Than [A7]the simple things they [D7]had
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 9}
So they planed there [G]future 
As [C]they laid close [G]together
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 10}
And later I was born there
In that [D7]big four poster [G]bed
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 11}
It was just some boards of rough cut [C]pine 
And a quilt of patch work [G]cotton
A [C]place to lay your body [G]down 
A [A7]place to rest your [D7]head
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 12}
[C]A field of fluffy mountains 
For a little girl to hide [G]in
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 13}
Clouds and chasing rainbows
Was that [D7]big four poster [G]bed
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 14}
I remember as a child waking up
[C]On a winter [G]morning
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 15}
With Sound of laughing voices
And [A7]the smell of baking [D7]bread
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 16}
And running across that coal wood [G]floor 
[C]Jumping there with [G]them
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 17}
And Lord I felt so safe and warm
In that [D7]big four poster [G]bed
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 18}
The day that daddy died
He [C]whispered something soft to [G]mama
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 19}
To this day she's never told a soul
[A7]The words he [D7]said
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 20}
She just smiled through her [G]tears 
And [C]held his hand and [G]nodded
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 21}
And my daddy looked so much at rest
In that [D7]big four poster [G]bed
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 22}
Now time has dried up all the tears
[C]Here I stand a [G]woman
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 23}
Your arms reach out to touch my soul
Your [A7]sweet words turn my [D7]head
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 24}
Darling won't you tell me [G]first 
[C]This will be [G]forever
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 25}
Before you lead me up the stairs
To that [D7]big four poster [G]bed
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 26}
Cause only love has ever touched
That [D7]big four poster [G]bed
{end_of_verse}
