{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]You know my love my [Em]only wish is [C]happiness for [F]you
So I [C]work real [Em]hard to [Am]strike it [C]rich [D7]but every time I [G7]do
I [C]blow it all on [Em]some old witch I [C]hardly ever [F]knew
[C]How come [Em]every [Am]time I [C]itch I [D7]wind up [G7]scratching [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
When every thing's ain't [Em]going right I [C]hurry home to [F]you
You [C]kiss my [Em]lips and you [Am]comfort [C]me [D7]as only you can [G7]do 
But the [C]eagle flies on [Em]Friday night and my [C]senses fly off [F]too
[C]How come [Em]every [Am]time I [C]itch I [D7]wind up [G7]scratching [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I [D7]dream of coming home to you a knight in shining [G7]armor
Cause it seems [F]to me that you rate much [C]more
Than a [D7]broken down busted [G7]farmer
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]Every time I [Em]get ahead I [C]act like someone [F]new
I [C]waste the [Em]whole night [Am]talking [C]big and [D7]spending money [G7]too
Then I [C]sneak in bed [Em]beside you [C]feeling broke and [F]blue
[C]How come [Em]every [Am]time I [C]itch I [D7]wind up [G7]scratching [C]you 
{end_of_verse}
