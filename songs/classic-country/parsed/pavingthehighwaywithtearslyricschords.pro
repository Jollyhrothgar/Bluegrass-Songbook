[G]I'm travelin' down a [D7]lonesome road of [G]sorrow

Without your love I [D7]face a blue [G]tomorrow
[D7]Paving the highway with [G]tears
{end_of_verse}

You [C]found another sweetheart that's [G]why I couldn't stay
Though [A7]I still love you darling [D7]I'm only in your way
So [G]step by step I [D7]walk away from [G]heaven
[D7]Paving the highway with [G]tears
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I've cried for you with [D7]every step I've [G]taken
[D7]Paving the highway with [G]tears
The road ahead is [D7]lonesome and [G]forsaken
When [D7]I look back on all those happy [G]years
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I'll [C]always love you darling and [G]should your new love fail
You'll [A7]find me if you follow the [D7]teardrops on the trail
[G]Without you dear [D7]I'll just go on [G]forever
[D7]Paving the highway with [G]tears
