{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I happened to walk into a honky tonk one night down in New [F]Orleans
[G7]Up above the bar hung a big guitar like none I'd ever [C]seen
The neck was set with diamonds and though the strings were [F]old
[G7]Like Kings of Sound they wound around six keys of solid [C]gold
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
A man stepped up beside me his breath was strong with [F]wine
[G7]He said you know that guitar once belonged to a mighty close pal of [C]mine
He used to play it right here I forget the year around '4[F]5 I think
[G7]Ha I could tell you quite a story friend if you'd care to buy me a [C]drink
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well possessed by every weakness that makes a man a [F]fool
[G7]I bought a round he drank it down and then he rocked back on his [C]stool
He said yeah I remember now it was '45 [F]alright
[G7]He just returned from the Great War that's where he lost his [C]sight 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
His buddies gave him that guitar at the time it was [F]simple and plain 
[G7]He added the gold and the diamonds as he played his way to [C]fame
He was doing a show in Shreveport the night he received the [F]call
[G7]To come appear on the Grand Ole Opry the greatest show of [C]all
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I was drivin' him to Nashville it was cold and misting [F]rain
[G7]The signals flashed and the whistle screamed 
But I swear Mr. I never saw that [C]train
I heard the doctor tell him just after he used his [F]knife
[G7]You're lucky son it was just your arm it could have been your [C]life
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
But he died that night life just demanded more than he could [F]give
[G7]I think he couldn’t've made it he just lost his will to [C]live
But this world's loss is heaven's gain and tonight he's [F]still a star
[G7]He plays with a band of angels that's my son's golden [C]guitar
{end_of_verse}
