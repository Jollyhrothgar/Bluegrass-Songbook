{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G7]As a [C]boy I believed it was [F]best just to leave
With a [C]shirt on my back and my [G7]heart on my sleeve
It was [C]time I was out on my [F]own
So I left [C]you and I left [G7]home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And I’ve [C]slept in some cars and I’ve [F]slept in some bars
And I’ve [C]slept in the yard of some [G7]fast falling stars
But there [C]ain’t been one dream that’s come [F]true
Since I left [C]home  [G7]since I left [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
In the [Am]col[F]d just one [C]memory’s warm
And in the [F]dark just one [G7]light comes on
Though I’m [C]lost there’s one [F]thing I’ve found
[C]I know the way to you [G7]I know the way to you by [C]heart[G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I [C]know what I’m feeling for [F]you is real
Like the [C]palm of my hand on this [G7]old steering wheel
And I’m [C]still on the road I’ve come [F]down
But thanks to [C]you  [G7]I’m homeward [C]bound
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
In the [Am]col[F]d just one [C]memory’s warm
And in the [F]dark just one [G7]light comes on
Though I’m [C]lost there’s one [F]thing I’ve found
[C]I know the way to you [G7]I know the way to you by [C]heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
I know the way to you [G7]I know the way to you 
[F]I know the [G7]way to you by [C]heart
I know the way to you [G7]I know the way to you 
[F]I know the [G7]way to you by [C]heart
I know the way to you [G7]I know the way to you 
[F]I know the [G7]way to you by [C]heart
{end_of_verse}
