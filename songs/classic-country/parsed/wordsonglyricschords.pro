{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I don't like big long words like [D7]Geography
All the little words are good [G]enough for me
Every time I try to say a [C]big word I get stuck
Like [G]fortopolyismin aww shucks
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I like little words that only [D7]have one part
Rat and cat and dog they make me [G]sound so smart
I try to say big words but I mess [C]up each time I do
Like [G]fortopolyismin aww bull
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well I wish they didn't have so many [D7]words so long
It makes it even worse when they get [G]in a song
I know that big long words were never [C]meant for me
Like [G]fortopolyismin well I'll be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I'd like to learn one big word to [D7]impress my friends
But I know I could never ever [G]get it in
One word that I know I will never ever [C]learn to say
Is [G]fortopolyismingpreed[D7]inphycho[G]lay
Hey I did it
Fortopolyismin aww shucks
{end_of_verse}
