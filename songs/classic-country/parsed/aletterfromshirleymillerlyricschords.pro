{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I got a letter to[F]day from [C]Shirley [D7]Miller
She’s [G7]living in [C]Ohio in a Presbyterian [G7]home
She’s [C]married a preacher and [F]rai[C]sing a [D7]family
She [G7]said she wrote the [C]letter [G7]cause she was scared to [C]phone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
She said she still remembers [F]things she [C]said she [D7]wouldn’t
She [G7]asked about my [C]travels and if Cleveland’s on my [G7]route
[C]Shirley says she’s chilly in that [F]cold [C]Ohio [D7]weather
But I [G7]think she’s warmer [C]than the hell [G7]her husbands talks [C]about
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
She [G7]says she was happy and [C]hoped that I was too
But [G7]I could read between the lines knowing [F]Shirley like I [G7]do
[C]She can’t hide the way she feels be[F]hind the [C]perfume [D7]note
I [G7]could tell her hand was [C]shaking [G7]in the letter Shirley [C]wrote
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Shirley said she didn’t [F]expect [C]me to [D7]answer
She [G7]said she only [C]wanted to get a few things off her [G7]chest
I [C]tore up those letters and said a [F]prayer [C]for the [D7]preacher
I’ll [G7]let him and the [C]good Lord [G7]take care of the [C]rest
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
She [G7]said she was happy and [C]hoped that I was too 
But [G7]I could read between the lines knowing [F]Shirley like I [G7]do
It’s [C]probably just a passing thing I [F]think [C]she’ll be al[D7]right
And [G7]I’m glad that Shirley [C]never wrote [G7]what she sat down to [C]write
{end_of_verse}
