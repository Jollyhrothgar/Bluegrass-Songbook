[Em]Knowing all the [G]while our [A7]love was [D7]wrong

[C]Were few and far [A7]between
[G]I knew we could [C]never [D7]love for [D7][G]long

[G]I shouldn't give a second thought of [C]how it might have [G]been
[Em]I shouldn't even [G]miss you [A7]when you're [D7]gone

[C]I knew at times you missed him
[G]Cause I heard you when you cried

[G]When you finally said goodbye
[A7]Oh how could I have ever been so [D7]blind

[G]I could never blame you cause I knew [C]it from the [G]start
[Em]You never really [G]tried to [A7]lead me [D7]on

[G]When I knew we could [C]never [D7]love for [G]long
