{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]We really shouldn't be a [D7]doing this 
And we both know [G]why
Just being close enough to [D7]think like this 
Enough to make you need to [G]lie
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
This kinda talk will lead us to [G7]somewhere 
We're gettin' way too close to [C]going there
The [A7]farther off the better to [D7]resist 
We really shouldn't be doing [G]this
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Only an isolated [D7]incident 
But the acquaintance left me [G]stunned
The first attraction was the [D7]hardest hit 
I thought I'd ever [G]overcome
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
This kinda situation [G7]has to pass 
This chance encounter has to [C]be the last
To [A7]take it further we would [D7]be remiss 
We really shouldn't be a doing [G]this
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
We'd each be hurting some[G7]body else 
If we don't say our good[C]byes real fast
Won't even think about a [D7]farewell kiss 
We really shouldn't be a doing [G]this
{end_of_verse}
