{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G7]All too [Dm]soon we were [F]blown upon our [G7]separate ways [C]again
And our [Dm]warm summer dreams
Joined the [F]fallen leaves that [G7]tumbled in the [C]wind
With the [Am]echoes and traces of [F]voices and faces
And [Dm]places that [F]I've left [G7]behind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But there's [C]times in the [F]morning
And there's [G7]times at the close of [C]day
When your memory comes easy as [F]smiling
And that's [G7]something they can't take [C]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G7]I may [Dm]die without [F]ever knowing [G7]happiness [C]again
Leaving [Dm]nothing behind 
But a [F]line of lonely [G7]footprints in the [C]sand
But I [Am]know that wherever I [F]go I will never trade 
[Dm]Anything [F]I'll ever [G7]find
