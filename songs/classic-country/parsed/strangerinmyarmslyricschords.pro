{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I don't thrill you like I used to do there's something on your [C]mind
Now [D7]you treat me cold instead of [G]warm
And you're not just not the same old you that I used to call [C]mine
[D7]And you feel like a stranger in my [G]arms
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]When I hold you close to me you still seem far [G]away
I [C]tried my best to bring you back but [G]something's in the [D7]way
And even [G]when I'm kissing you I'm missing all your [C]charms
[D7]And you feel like a stranger in my [G]arms
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I don't see the love light in your eyes for me no [C]more
The [D7]flame is cold that used to burn so [G]warm
There's a strangeness in your ways I'd never known [C]before
[D7]And you feel like a stranger in my [G]arms
{end_of_verse}
