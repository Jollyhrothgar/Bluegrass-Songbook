{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]There are times I don't know where I'm [F]going
For I [G7]keep looking back at where I've [C]been
Always searching for some new [F]beginning
To [G7]only end up where I've always [C]been
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C7]Don't like [F]thinking it only feeds the [C]memory
That keeps [D7]fighting for a way to [G7]survive
I [C]know there were those that could have loved [F]me
But they'd [G7]only keep your memories [C]alive
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Even time just couldn't down your [F]memories
In a [G7]way I may never be [C]free
Oh but I've kept my mind at least that's [F]something
While [G7]you and I  were running out on [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C7]Don't like [F]thinking it only feeds the [C]memory
That keeps [D7]fighting for a way to [G7]survive
I [C]know there were those that could have loved [F]me
But they'd [G7]only keep your memories [C]alive
