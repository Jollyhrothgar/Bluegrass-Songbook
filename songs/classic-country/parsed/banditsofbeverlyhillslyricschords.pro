{meta: artist Kris Kristofferson}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]She knew the moment their eyes came together 
They'd never need to [G7]explain
He was a bandit behind his behavior 
She was precisely the [C]same
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Laughing and dancing those gay caballeros 
They looked so wild and so [F]free
She [G7]likes him a little light on the loafers 
But bless his heart so does [C]he 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And he [F]covers for her and she [C]covers for him 
If it's [F]wild and they want to they [C]will
But the [F]dangers are real and the [C]chances are slim
And there [G7]ain't nothing cheap 
But the thrill in the badlands of Beverly [C]Hills
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
He had a mustache that made him look macho 
And she wore a [G7]mole on her cheek
Makin' the run around Rodeo Avenue 
Dancing boutique to [C]boutique
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
And the truth is a question with too many answers 
And so hard to face on your [F]own
[G7]Beauty is only as deep as the skin 
Ugly goes clear to the [C]bone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And he [F]covers for her and she [C]covers for him 
If it's [F]wild and they want to they [C]will
But the [F]dangers are real and the [C]chances are slim
And there [G7]ain't nothing cheap 
But the thrill in the badlands of Beverly [C]Hills
{end_of_verse}
