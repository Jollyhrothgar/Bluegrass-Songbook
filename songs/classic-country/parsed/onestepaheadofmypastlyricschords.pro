{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]The love that I've waited [C]and longed [G]for 
Is here in my [C]arms at [G]last
But [C]she doesn't know all about [G]me 
I'm just one step [D7]ahead of my [G]past
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Now I'm walking the old [C]straight and [G]narrow 
But yesterday's [C]coming up [G]fast
Cause [C]you can't keep people from [G]talking 
I'm just one step [D7]ahead of my [G]past
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Cause when I played at [C]love 
I made my mistakes where [D7][G]every-one could [D7][G]see
Now [G]wondering if she'll [A7]understand 
Is always haunting [D7]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Will the [G]news break the [C]heart of my [G]darling
And close the door to my [C]future at [G]last
Till [C]the day she knows all about [G]me 
I'm one step [D7]ahead of my [G]past
{end_of_verse}
