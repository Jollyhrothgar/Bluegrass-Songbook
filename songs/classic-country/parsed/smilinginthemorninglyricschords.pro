{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]She was smiling in the morning
But was crying in the afternoon
I had to tell her I was leaving
And I guess I went and changed her [Dm]tune
Even though we said a [G7]sad goodbye
Was [C]something we would not [A7]do
She was [F]smiling in the morning
And [G7]crying in the after[C]noon
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I got a transatlantic ticket in my pocket
And I'll soon be gone
I thought we had it understood
That I wouldn't be staying [Dm]long
And where I'm going ain't the [G7]kind of place
A [C]woman can feel at [A7]home
I got a [F]transatlantic ticket in my [G7]pocket
And I'll soon be [C]gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Oh we [F]thought we'd draw just a [Em]little bit of love
Then [Dm]say goodbye what were we [G7]thinking of
