{meta: artist Kris Kristofferson}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I built my own chains in the [F]land of the [G]free
A slave to a job that meant [A7]nothing to [D7]me
With three [G]shiny new cars and a [F]split-level [G]home
To furnish the tomb I was [F]dying to [G]own
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Then [C]one day I wakened with fear in my eye
[G]Aware of a world that was passing me [D7]by
And I [G]knew that my savings of [F]silver and [G]gold
Would mean not a thing when my [F]body was [G]cold
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Because life is a song for the [C]dying to [G]sing
It’s got to have feeling to [A7]mean any[D7]thing
And a [G]man can get by without [C]silver or [G]gold
With bread for the body and [F]song for the [G]soul
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I’m living my life by the [F]lesson I’ve [G]learned
And not looking back at the [A7]bridges I’ve [D7]burned
Cause the [G]time that we travel from [F]cradle to [G]grave
Was meant to be spent and not [F]meant to be [G]saved
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
And I [C]know there are some who will say I’m a fool
But I [G]don’t give a damn for the people that [D7]do
Cause if [G]down in a dungeon is [F]where they [G]belong
Well that’s their misfortune and [F]none of my [G]own
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Because life is a song for the [C]dying to [G]sing
It’s got to have feeling to [A7]mean any[D7]thing
And a [G]man can get by without [C]silver or [G]gold
With bread for the body and [F]song for the [G]soul
{end_of_verse}
