{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]The warden led [D7]a prisoner 
Down the [C]hallway to his [G]doom
I stood up to say goodbye like all [D7]the rest
I [G]heard him tell [D7]the warden 
Just [C]before he reached [G]my cell
Let my guitar playing [D7]friend do [G]my request
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Let him sing me back [D7]home 
With the [C]songs I used [G]to hear
Make my old memories come [D7]alive
[G]Take me [D7]away and [C]turn back the [G]years
Let him sing me back [D7]home before [G]I die
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I recall last Sunday [D7]morning 
A [C]choir came off the [G]street
Came in to sing a few old gospel [D7]songs
I [G]heard him tell [D7]the singers
There's a [C]song my mamma [G]sang
Could I hear it once [D7]before you move [G]along
