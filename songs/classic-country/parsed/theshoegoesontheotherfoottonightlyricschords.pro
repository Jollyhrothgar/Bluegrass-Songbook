[G]How [C]long did you think you could go on hurting [G]me

Cause the shoe goes on the other foot [D7]tonight

Each [C]time you walk out the door you walk on [G]me
And [D7]you leave the door wide open for the [G]blues
[C]You fly away from me like you are [G]free
[D7]You must think there's wings upon your [G]shoes
