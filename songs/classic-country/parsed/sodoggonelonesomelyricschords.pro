{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I do my best to hide this lowdown feeling 
I try to make believe there's nothing [G7]wrong
But [C]they're always asking me about you [F]darling
And it [C]hurts me so to [G7]tell 'em that you're [C]gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
If they ask me I guess I'd be denying
That I've been unhappy all [G7]alone
But [C]if they heard my heart they'd hear it [F]crying
[C]Where's my darling [G7]when's she coming [C]home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I [F]ask myself a million times what's right for me to [C]do
To [F]try to lose my blues alone or [C]hang around for [G7]you
[C]But I make it pretty good until that moon comes shining [F]through
And [C]then I get so doggone [C][G7]lonesome
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Time stands still when you're a waiting
Sometimes I think my heart is stopping [G7]too
[C]One lonely hour seems [F]forever 
[C]Sixty minutes [G7]more to wait for [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
But I guess I'll keep waiting till you're with me
Cause I believe that loving you is [G7]right
But [C]I don't care if the sun don't rise [F]tomorrow 
[C]If I can't have you with [G7]me [C]tonight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
[F]Well I know I'll keep on loving you cause true love can't be [C]killed 
I [F]ought to get you off of my mind but I [C]guess I never [G7]will
[C]I could have a dozen others but I know I'd love you [F]still
[C]Cause I get so doggone [C][G7]lonesome
{end_of_verse}
