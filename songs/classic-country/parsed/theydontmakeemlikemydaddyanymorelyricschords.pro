{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I wasn't much more than a baby I thought he was a bear
The way my daddy carried me [D7]around 
They said I learned to walk 
While holding on to just one finger 
On the hand of a man that's standing six foot [G]three 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Not old enough to understand the meaning of depression 
Just something people talk about a [D7]lot
My Daddy wasn't one to try to make no big impression 
Just one heck of a man that worked for what he [G]got 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
They don't [C]make men like my daddy anymore 
Guess they've [G]thrown away the pattern through the years 
[C]In the great big land of freedom  
At a [G]time when we really [C]need 'em 
They don't [G]make 'em like my [D7]daddy any [G]more 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
From the Johnson County court house  
To the hills of West Virginia 
My daddy worked down in them dark cold [D7]mines 
Education didn't count so much as what you had born in you    
Like the will to live and a dream of better [G]times 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Daddy never took a hand out we ate pinto beans and bacon 
But he worked to keep the wolf back from the [D7]door 
And it only proves one thing to me  
When folks start bellyaching 
They don't make 'em like my daddy any [G]more 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
They don't [C]make men like my daddy anymore 
Guess they've [G]thrown away the pattern through the years 
[C]In the great big land of freedom  
At a [G]time when we really [C]need 'em 
They don't [G]make 'em like my [D7]daddy any [G]more 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
They don't make 'em like my [D7]daddy any [G]more
