{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Baby when I met you there was peace unknown
I set out to get you with a fine tooth c[C7]omb
I was [F]soft inside there was something going [C]on
You do something to me that I can't explain
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Hold me closer and I feel no [C7]pain every [F]beat of my heart
We got something going [C]on
Tender love is [F]blind  it requires a dedication
[Fm]All this love we feel needs no conversation
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
We r[C]ide it together uh huh 
Making love with each other un huh
Islands in the stream  that is what we [F]are
No one in between how can we be wrong
Sail away with [C]me to another [F]world
And we re[C]ly on each other uh huh
From one [F]lover to another uh [C]huh
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I can't live without you if the love was gone
Everything is nothing if you got no [C7]one 
And you did w[F]alk in the night
Slowly losing sight of the [C]real thing       
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
But that won't happen to us and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and we got no way [C7]out
And the me[F]ssage is clear this could be the year
For the re[C]al thing
No more will you [F]cry  baby I will hurt you never
We s[Fm]tart and end as one in love for ever we can
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
We r[C]ide it together uh huh 
Making love with each other un huh
Islands in the stream  that is what we [F]are
No one in between how can we be wrong
Sail away with [C]me to another [F]world
And we re[C]ly on each other uh huh
From one [F]lover to another uh [C]huh
