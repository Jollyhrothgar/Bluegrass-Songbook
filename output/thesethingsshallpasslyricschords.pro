{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]These things shall pass and some great [C]morning 
We'll look [G]back and smile at heartaches we have [D7]known 
So don't forget [G]when shadows [C]gather 
The Lord our [G]God is still the King [D7]upon His [G]throne 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
A [D7]rose looks gray at midnight but the flame is just [G]asleep 
And [A7]steel is strong because it knew the hammer and white [D7]heat 
These [G]things shall pass and life be [C]sweeter 
When love and [G]faith are strong they [D7]cannot long [G]endure 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
These things shall pass so don't you [C]worry 
The darkest [G]time is just one hour before [D7]dawn 
So hold up high [G]and face your [C]troubles 
And don't [G]despair if you must face [D7]them all [G]alone 
{end_of_verse}
