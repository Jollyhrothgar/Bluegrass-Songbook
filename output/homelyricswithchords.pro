{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]The only the thing I see ahead 
Is [F]just the heat a [G7]rising off the [C]road
The rainbows I've been [G7]chasing 
Keep on [F]fadin' before I [G7]find my pot of [C]gold
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And [F]more and more I'm thinking that 
The only treasures that I'll ever [C]know[Am]
Are [C]long ago and far behind 
[G7]Wrapped up in my memories of [C]home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]Home was a swimming hole and a fishing pole 
And the feel of a muddy road between my [C]toes
[F]Home was a back porch swing where I would sit 
And mom would sing [C]Amazing Grace 
While she hung out the [G7]clothes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[F]Home was an easy chair with my daddy there 
And the smell of Sunday supper on the [C]stove[Am]
My [C]footsteps carry me away 
But [G7]in my mind I'm always going [C]home[G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Now the [C]miles I put behind me 
Ain't as [F]hard as the [G7]miles that lay [C]ahead
And it's way too late to [G7]listen 
To the [F]words of wisdom [G7]that my daddy [C]said
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
The [F]straight and narrow path he showed me 
Turned into a thousand winding [C]roads[Am]
My [C]footsteps carry me away 
But [G7]in my mind I'm always going [C]home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]Home was a swimming hole and a fishing pole 
And the feel of a muddy road between my [C]toes
[F]Home was a back porch swing where I would sit 
And mom would sing [C]Amazing Grace 
While she hung out the [G7]clothes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[F]Home was an easy chair with my daddy there 
And the smell of Sunday supper on the [C]stove[Am]
My [C]footsteps carry me away 
But [G7]in my mind I'm always going [C]home[G7]
