{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]A memory often [G7]comes to [C]visit 
As I [C7]lay in my bed late at [F]night
Of momma alone in the [C]kitchen 
Mending clothes by a little oil [G7]light
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
She [C]sewed till her [G7]fingers were [C]swollen 
Till she [C7]couldn't keep sleep from her [F]eyes
Then daddy would go in to [C]wake her 
He'd kiss her and [G7]I'd hear him [C]sigh
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
There won't be any [G7]patches in [C]heaven
You'll look so pretty with a [C7]halo in your [F]hair
And if angels are judged by the [C]deeds they have done
Mom you'll be the best [G7]dressed angel [C]there
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I was the [G7]oldest of [C]seven 
So I was the [C7]first to leave [F]home
And my dreams were designed for my [C]momma 
All the pretties that she'd never [G7]known
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
But the [C]first pretty [G7]dress that I [C]gave her 
She smiled and [C7]then bowed her [F]head
She said honey the kids need these things more than [C]I do
And the tears filled [G7]my eyes as I [C]said
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
She [C]sewed till her [G7]fingers were [C]swollen 
Till she [C7]couldn't keep sleep from her [F]eyes
Then daddy would go in to [C]wake her 
He'd kiss her and [G7]I'd hear him [C]sigh
