{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]A list of things that I would do to [D7]get you back again
[G7]Would use up all the paper in the [C]world
I've done so many crazy things I'll [D7]never make them right
[G7]And I know you won't ever come back [C]girl
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But I hope at least I [G7]get to see you [F]every now and then
[G7]Somewhere in a crowd if nothing [C]more
And I'd hate to think of [G7]going through life [F]never more to see
The [G7]girl who was so close to me [C]before
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I know that me calling you would [D7]only bring you down
[G7]And I don't want you no more down on [C]me
I care how you feel so I'll just [D7]stay out of your life
It [G7]looks like this is how it's got to [C]be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But I hope at least I [G7]get to see you [F]every now and then

And I'd hate to think of [G7]going through life [F]never more to see
The [G7]girl who was so close to me [C]before
