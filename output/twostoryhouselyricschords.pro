{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]We always wanted a [G7]big two story [C]house
Back when we lived in that [G7]little two room [C]shack
We wanted fame and fortune and we'd live life the [C7]way the rich folks [F]do
We [C]knew some how we'd make it [G7]together me and [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
With dreams and hopes of things to come we [G7]worked and never [C]stopped
Not much time for you and me we [G7]had to reach the [C]top
We bought that big two story house and soon be[C7]came the envy of the [F]town
With [C]all our work behind us we'd [G7]finally settle [C]down
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now we live (yes we live) in a [F]two story [G7]house
Whoa what [C]splendor but there's [F]no love [G7]about
[C]I've got my [G7]story and [C]I've got mine [F]too
How sad it [C]is we now live in a [G7]two story [C]house
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
The house is filled with rare antiques there's [G7]marble on the [C]floor
Beauty all around us like we've [G7]never seen [C]before
There's chandeliers in every room imported [C7]silks and satin all [F]about
We [C]filled the house with everything but [G7]somehow left love [C]out
{end_of_verse}
