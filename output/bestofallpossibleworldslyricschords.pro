{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I was [E7]runnin' through the summer rain 
Tryin' to catch that evenin' train
And [A7]kill that old familiar pain 
Weevin' through my tangled brain
But [D7]when I tipped my bottle back 
I smacked into a cop I didn't [G]see
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
That [E7]policeman said Mr. Cool 
If you're ain't drunk then you're a fool
I said [A7]well if that's against the law 
Then tell me why I never saw
A [D7]man locked in that jail of yours 
Who wadn't just as lowdown poor as [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well that was when someone turned out the [Am]lights
And [D7]I wound up in jail to spend the [G]nights
And dream of all the wine and lonely [C]girls 
In [D7]this best of all possible [G]worlds
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Well I [E7]woke up next morning 
Feelin' like my head was gone
And like [A7]my thick old tongue was lickin' 
Somethin' sick and wrong
And I [D7]told that man I'd sell my soul 
If somethin' wet and cold is that old [G]cell
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
That [E7]kindly jailer just grinned at me 
All eaten up with sympathy
Then he [A7]bought himself another beer 
And came and whispered in my ear
That [D7]booze was just a dime a bottle boy 
You couldn't even buy the [G]smell
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
I said I knew there was somethin' I liked about this [Am]town
But [D7]it takes more than that to bring me [G]down down down down
But there's still a lot of wine and lonely [C]girls 
In [D7]this best of all possible [G]worlds
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Well [E7]they finally came and they told me 
They was a gonna set me free
And I'd [A7]be leavin' town 
If I knew what was good for me
I [D7]said it's nice to learn that 
Everybody's so concerned about my [G]health
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
I [E7]said I won't be leavin' 
No more quicker than I possibly can
Cause [A7]I've enjoyed about 
This much of this as I can stand
And I [D7]don't need this town of yours 
More than I never needed nothin' [G]else
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 9}
Cause there's still a lotta drinks that I ain't [Am]drunk
Lots [D7]of pretty thoughts that I ain't never [G]thunk oh yeah
Lord there's still so many lonely [C]girls 
In [D7]this best of all possible [G]worlds
{end_of_verse}
