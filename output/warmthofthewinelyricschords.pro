[C]I'll open the [Em]bottle that [F]closes the [G7]past
[C]Just filling up [Em]top by [F]draining my [G7]glass
[C]She's out of my [Em]life but she's [F]still on my [G7]mind
[C]So I'm chilling her [Am]memory in the [G7]warmth of the [C]wine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The taste is so [Em]bitter but the [F]glow is so [G7]sweet
[C]The man she dis[Em]mantled is [F]once more [G7]complete
[C]The pieces of [Em]my life she [F]scattered so [G7]fine
[C]Once more fused [Am]together in the [G7]warmth of the [C]wine

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The [G7]warmth of the wine is my [F]soul saving [C]fire
[G7]Without it I'd freeze in the [F]storm of d[C]esire
But with it I'll [Am]make it and [F]I feel so [G7]fine
My [F]cold glass of love is the [G7]warmth of the wine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]For some it's too [Em]early but for [F]me it's too [G7]late
[C]The wine sets me [Em]free but won't [F]let me [G7]escape
[C]So I'll sit here each [Em]night till they [F]turn out the [G7]sign
[C]Out of the [Am]cold in the [G7]warmth of the [C]wine 
{end_of_verse}
