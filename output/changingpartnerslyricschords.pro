[G7]We were [C]waltzing together to a dreamy melo[F]dy
[A7]When they [Dm]called out change [G7]partners and you [C]waltzed a[G7]way from [C]me
[G7]Now my [C]arms feel so empty as I gaze [E7]around the [A7]floor 
And I'll [Dm]keep on [G7]changing [C]partners [A7]till I [Dm]hold [G7]you once [C]more

[G7]Though we [C]danced for one moment and too soon we had to [F]part 
[A7]In that [Dm]wonderful [G7]moment something [C]happened [G7]to my [C]heart
[G7]So I'll [C]keep changing partners till you're in my [E7]arms and [A7]then 
Oh my [Dm]darling [G7]I will [C]never [A7]change [Dm]partners [G7]a-ga[C]in
