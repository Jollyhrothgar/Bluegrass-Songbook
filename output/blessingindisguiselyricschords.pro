{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]You wouldn't read my [C7]letter if I [F]wrote you
You [G7]asked me not to call you on the [C]phone [G7]
But there's [C]somethin' I [C7]wanted to [F]tell you
So I [G7]wrote it in the words of this [C]song
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Well I guess you know [F]you took me by sur[C]prise [F]  [C]
When you [G7]told me that you'd [F]broken all the [C]rules [F]  [C]
And the future felt as [F]empty as your [C]eyes [F]  [C]
When I [G7]realized how far I was from [C]you  [C7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
But they t[F]ell me that the truth will set you f[C]ree
[G7]From the sad con[F]fusion of your [C]lies  [C7]
And it [F]led me to a side of you that [C]I'd refused to [F]see
So I [C]guess it's been a [G7]blessing in dis[F]guise
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]So there's nothing left to [F]keep us holding [C]on now [F]  [C]
To the [G7]mystery we [F]used to be [C]before [F]  [C]
What we ever shared to[F]gether there is [C]gone now [F]  [C]
And what [G7]might have been don't matter any[C]more  [C7]
