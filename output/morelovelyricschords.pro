{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G7]When we [C]met I [G7]told her I'd [C]give her the [F]moon
And I [G7]did on a [C]silver [F]spoon
If I'd only [C]known the [G7]promise I [C]kept would be [F]wrong
Well [G7]she might [C]not be [F]gone
Now it's [Em]easy to [Am]see
The [Dm]only thing [C]she [F]needed from [G7]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Was [C]more love [Am]more time
[Dm]More of her knowing that [G7]she's on my mind
[C]More of her heart [G7]would have suited her [Am]fine
Cause [F]that's what she was dreaming [G7]of
She [F]only needed [G7]more [C]love [G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
She [C]tried [G7]telling me [C]time and [F]again
But [G7]I didn't [C]listen back [F]then [G7]
Oh my [C]God it [G7]took her [C]saying [F]goodbye
To [G7]finally open [C]up my [F]eyes
And if my [Em]prayers came [Am]true
I [Dm]know just [C]what I'd [F]do[G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I'd give her [C]more love [Am]more time
[Dm]More of her knowing that [G7]she's on my mind
[C]More of my heart [G7]would have suited her [Am]fine
Cause [F]that's what she was dreaming [G7]of
She needed [C]more love [Am]more time
[Dm]Less of the things that [G7]money can buy
[C]More of my arms [G7]just [Am]holding her tight
When it [F]all adds up to the [G7]bottom line
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
The [C]answer's the same [F]every time
Of [Dm]all that she was dreaming [G7]of
She [F]only needed [C]more love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
I [Dm]nearly gave her [G7]enough
She [F]only needed [G7]more [C]love
{end_of_verse}
