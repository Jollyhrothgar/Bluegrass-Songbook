{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[D7]Do you re[G]call [C]  when I was six
I got [Bm]lost out in the [G]woods 
And you [D7]worried yourself sick
What about the [G]day  I [C]got in my first fight
[Bm]Momma she got [G]mad but [D7]you swelled up with pride
I [Em]never knew how deep a [C]fathers love could [D7]run [Em]
Until I [C]had a [D7]son
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
From [G]watching him learn how to crawl
To [Em]skinned up knees from skateboard falls
To [C]praying he'd get through football [D7]alive
From [G]hearing his first words spoken
The [Em]first time his heart got broken
And [C]knowing soon he'll spread his wings and [D7]fly
I [Am]guess I didn't know what a daddy goes [D7]thru
'Til I was a daddy [G]too
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[D7]Real [G]love the kind that you [C]can't understand
Until you [Bm]hold it in your [G]arms 
And [D7]touch it with your hands
Pure [G]joy the kind that you can only [C]find
When you [G]live your life for them
And [D7]leave yourself behind
[Em]More and more I'm [C]seeing life go [D7]by
Thru my daddy's eyes

[D7]The fast [G]pace of time goes racing
From [Em]first grade to graduation
