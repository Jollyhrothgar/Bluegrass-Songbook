He [F]said that when he [G7]kissed her [F]her kisses were like [C]wine
And [G7]suddenly I [C]wondered if [D7]she'd break his heart like [G7]mine
[C]But I sat there in [G7]silence and [F]smoked my [C]cigarette
His heart [G7]would soon [C]discover heartbreak [F]in [C]silhouette

Two broken [G7]hearts were [C]sharing heartbreak [F]in [C]Silhouette 
Heartbreak [F]in [C]silhouette
