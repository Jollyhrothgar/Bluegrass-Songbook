{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]In a garden of city streets I watched her [C]growing there[Am]
Prettier by [D7]far than the flowers in her own [G]black hair
And the traffic kinda [G7]cools it and it [C]stops for awhile[Am]
Just to [G]watch her walk and [D7]smile a pretty [C]smi[G]le
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And I wouldn't know her even if I [C]never heard her name
Cause [A7]no matter what they call her to [D7]me it's all the same
So a [G]rose by any other name is still a [C]rose[Am]
Though I [D7]know her Christian name is [C]Mari[G]a 
But a rose by any other name is still a [C]rose[Am]
And my [G]friend you'll know what I [D7]mean the moment you [C]see [G]her
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Oh yesterday we touched for the [C]first time[Am]
It was with a [D7]weight when I felt her cherry [G]lips on mine
And the tears ran down her [G7]cheeks 
And she whispered darling [C]I love you[Am]
Oh even [G]being in the [D7]ghetto dreams [C]come [G]true
