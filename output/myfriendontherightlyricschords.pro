My Friend On The Right
Recorded Faron Young
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]Well this ol' picture is so [G7]faded you can [C]hardly see
And that smilin' face there in the [G7]middle well you can [C]see it's me
And that pretty girl there on my left was [F]mine to hold so tight
But I lost [C]her to my [F]friend there on the [C]right
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And that big house you [G7]see there in the [C]background
That big shiny car I [G7]bought to drive [C]her around
And just to keep her [C7]happy I worked hard [F]both day and night
Now it [C]all belongs to my [F]friend there on the [C]right
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
The [F]picture showed the truth but I was [C]oh so blind
I was a guy in the [D7]middle all the [G7]time
I [C]built my hopes up till they [C7]were out of [F]sight
And then she [C]walked away with my [F]friend there on the [C]right
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[F]Yes she [C]walked away with my [F]friend there on the [C]right
{end_of_verse}
