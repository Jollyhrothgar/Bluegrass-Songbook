{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[D7]The lights go out each evening at [G]eleven
[D7]And up and down our block there's not a [G]sound
[D7]I close my eyes and search for peaceful [G]slumber
[C]And just then the local [D7]memory comes [G]around
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]Piles of blues against the door
[G]To make sure sleep will come no more
[D7]He's the hardest working memory in this town
[C]Turns out happiness again and then lets loneliness back [G]in
[C]And each night the local [D7]memory comes [G]around
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[D7]Each day I say tonight I may escape [G]her
[D7]I pretend I'm happy and never even a [G]frown
[D7]But at night I close my eyes and pray sleep finds [G]me
[C]But again the local [D7]memory comes [G]around
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]Rids the house of all good news then sets out my crying [G]shoes
[D7]What a faithful memory never lets me down
[C]We're both up till light of day chasing happiness [G]away
[C]And each night the local [D7]memory comes [G]around
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]Piles of blues against the door
[G]To make sure sleep will come no more
[D7]He's the hardest working memory in this town
[C]Turns out happiness again and then lets loneliness back [G]in
[C]And each night the local [D7]memory comes [G]around
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[C]And each night the local [D7]memory comes [G]around
{end_of_verse}
