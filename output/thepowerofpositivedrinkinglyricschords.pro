[C]Only come here once a day at [F]hurtin' time 
[G7]Payday Charley knows I'm good for [C]every dime 
And I ease up on the barstool where I [F]ease my pain 
I'm [G7]never strong enough to face that lonely night [C]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh the power the powers of [F]drinkin' 
[G7]And it's foolin' all of my negative [C]thinkin' 
And it hurts so good I never notice [F]the sinkin' 
Thanks a [G7]lot to positive [C]drinkin'
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well Charley always lets me take a [F]bottle home 
[G7]After all a man he can't fake it when he's [C]all alone 
And when the whiskey's talkin' I can't hear [F]your memory 
Cause a [G7]little drinkin' drowns out a lot of you and [C]me
