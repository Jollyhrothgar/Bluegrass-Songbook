{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]My buddy Jim has [F]loved a lot and [C]broke a lot of [G7]vows
I’ve [C]seen him laugh while [F]others cried his [C]head was [G7]never [C]bowed
But fate has ruled [F]he be repaid and [C]gave his heart to [G7]Sue 
But [C]Jim can’t seem to [F]find a way to [C]make her [G7]love him [C]too
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
If [F]I were Jim I’d [C]laugh in her face [F]find someone to [C]take her place 
[F]And I wouldn’t cry if [C]I were him but I’m [G7]glad that I’m not [C]him
[G7]Glad that I’m not [C]him
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Last night he saw her [F]cuddled in the [C]arms of someone [G7]else
The [C]way he cried [F]has he no pride or [C]could he [G7]help him[C]self
The things she’ll do to [F]make him blue just [C]makes him love her [G7]more 
It’s [C]strange how much a [F]heart can take [C]before it [G7]locks its [C]door

[G7]Glad that I’m not [C]him
