{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]When I   [C7]stop [F]dreaming that's [C]when I'll [G7]stop loving [C]you
The worst that I've ever been [F]hurt in my [C]life 
The [G7]first time I've ever have [F]wanted to [C]die
Was the night when you told me you loved someone [F]else
And [C]asked me if I could [G7]forget
[C]When I   [C7]stop [F]dreaming that's [C]when I'll [G7]stop wanting [C]you

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You may teach the flowers to bloom in the snow
And [G7]you may take a pebble and [F]teach it to [C]grow
You may teach all the rain drops to return to the [F]clouds
But [C]you can't teach my heart to [G7]forget
[C]When I  [C7]stop [F]dreaming that's [C]when I'll [G7]stop loving [C]you
