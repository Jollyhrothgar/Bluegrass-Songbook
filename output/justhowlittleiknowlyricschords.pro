{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I remember my granddaddy carvin' on a block of pine
He shortly laid his [F]old knife down and opened up his [C]mind
He said we never [F]know how long we'll be [C]around
I wanna [F]share with you a nugget of truth 
[G7]Somethin' that an old man found
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Every livin' [F]soul is like a sack of [C]seed
You need room to [G7]grow and room to [C]breathe
There ain't much [F]more I'm [G7]sure of 
[C]This far down the [F]road
Cause the longer I live the more I learn 
[G7]Just how little I [C]know[F]  [Fm]    [C]
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus: Repeat 1}
Every livin' [F]soul is like a sack of [C]seed
You need room to [G7]grow and room to [C]breathe
There ain't much [F]more I'm [G7]sure of 
[C]This far down the [F]road
Cause the longer I live the more I learn 
[G7]Just how little I [C]know[F]  [Fm]    [C]
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus: Repeat 2}
Every livin' [F]soul is like a sack of [C]seed
You need room to [G7]grow and room to [C]breathe
There ain't much [F]more I'm [G7]sure of 
[C]This far down the [F]road
Cause the longer I live the more I learn 
[G7]Just how little I [C]know[F]  [Fm]    [C]

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
He said I wish I had a dollar for every bridge I've turned
But there's nothin' that'll [F]substitute 
For the things we live and [C]learn
And Lord knows I've [F]lived and I'm still [C]alive
And the [F]school of hard knocks has taught me 
A little [G7]horse sense I'll get you by
