{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]We started out so poor but we were happy
Then fortune smiled upon us for a [C]while
We bought a great estate out in the [F]country
Com[G7]plete with obligations social [C]style
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
From [G7]that time on a [D7]wall was thrown be[G7]tween us
While moving from our [D7]old ways to the [G7]new
And [C]you did things you never would have [F]thought of
Cause they were [G7]socially accepted things to [C]do
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I'll swear at times I couldn't recog[G7]nize you
Among the crowd of diamonds dye and [C]mink
But then I didn't see you very [F]often
Because of [G7]social obligations I [C]think
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
In [G7]fact I see you [D7]now more than I [G7]used to
I read the local [D7]papers every[G7]day
But [C]things that they won't print I hear a[F]bout you
But they're your [G7]social obligations you'd [C]say
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
And you've got [G7]social obligations every[C]day
{end_of_verse}
