{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Ain't got much learnin' I ain't a yearnin'
For the [C7]bright lights that shine upon [G7]Broadway
In my heart there's a burnin' for the old home I'm yearnin'
I guess I'm just a plain old country [C]boy
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
This may sound funny the skies would all be sunny
If I was [C7]doing chores back on the [G7]farm
Though we ain't got lots of money got bees to make our honey
I guess I'm just a plain old country [C]boy
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Oh I [F]want to go back down [C]among the sleepy pines
[D7]That's where I'll find that [G7]old sweetheart of mine
Each day I'm [C]scheming each night I'm dreaming
Bout a [C7]place where cloths don't make the [G7]man
Soon my pappy I'll be seeing hear the neighbors sayin' we'un 
I’ll always be a plain old country [C]boy
{end_of_verse}
