{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]The whole big town of Knoxville 
Is your playground every [G7]night
It seems I'm just your everyday plaything 
And honey that ain't [C]right
But my kinda love turns strong and steady 
Not off and on like a neon [F]flash
But if [G7]you don't like my sweet kinda love then baby
Then go on out and pick up Sally [C]Trash
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]She's been picked up many times 
Then [C]dropped like a hot potato
And she's been [D7]squeezed and handled 
Like an overripe [G7]tomato  
But [C]she don't really love your lovin' 
She just likes your [F]cash
So if [G7]you don't want my sweet kinda love then baby
Then go on out and pick up Sally [C]Trash
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I kept the home-fires burnin' just as long as I [G7]intend
It seems you're just a little bit tired of what you're gettin' [C]in
I'm not just gonna stand around and wait for you to [F]crash
If [G7]you don't like my sweet kinda love then baby
Then go on out and pick up Sally [C]Trash
