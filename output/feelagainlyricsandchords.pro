{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]All the [G7]times I can't be with you and you get tired of being left [C]alone
And your [G7]mind needs reassurance that to me you're still the only [C]one
This love I have for you is stronger now than it's ever [G7]been
So if you ever get the feeling I don't love you feel [C]again

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]Baby all you [G7]have to do is feel [F]the love I have [G7]for you is touch [C]me
[G7]Then you can't help but know there's a wealth of love that's burning deep [C]within
Ever day I'm thankful that I have you as a lover and a [G7]friend
So if you ever get the feeling I don't love you feel [C]again
