{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Though I watched you [B7]with the [C]smile as you started [B7]down the [C]aisle
I was [G7]listening to the bells that broke my [C]heart
They were ringing [B7]out the [C]joy of a lucky [B7]girl and [C]boy
But for [G7]me they were the bells that broke my [C]heart [C7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
For they [F]told me I have lost you now [C]forever
And I hoped and prayed we'd made just one more [G7]start
[C]And I saw what [B7]might have [C]been from the outside [B7]looking [C]in
As I [G7]listen to the bells that broke my [C]heart [C7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
For I [F]knew that I could never love [C]another
And they told me that forever we must [G7]part
[C]Still my eyes are [B7]filled with [C]tears and I know down [B7]through the [C]years
I'll be [G7]listening to the bells that broke my [C]heart
{end_of_verse}
