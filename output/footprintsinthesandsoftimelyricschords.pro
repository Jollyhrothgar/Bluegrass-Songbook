{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]The strange lonely [C]whistle of the [G]distant movin' train
Breaks the silence of the gray winter [D7]skies
As I [G]walk with my be[C]longings down the [G]road I've never seen
While the bitter wind brings [D7]teardrops to my [G]eyes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Oh [D7]where will I [G]be when [C]tomorrow wakens [G]me
Am I [C]looking for a [D7]dream I'll never [G]find
Will [D7]I ever [G]be the [C]man I want to [G]be
Or for[C]gotten footprints [G]in the [D7]sands of [G]time
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus: Repeat 1}
Oh [D7]where will I [G]be when [C]tomorrow wakens [G]me
Am I [C]looking for a [D7]dream I'll never [G]find
Will [D7]I ever [G]be the [C]man I want to [G]be
Or for[C]gotten footprints [G]in the [D7]sands of [G]time
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus: Repeat 2}
Oh [D7]where will I [G]be when [C]tomorrow wakens [G]me
Am I [C]looking for a [D7]dream I'll never [G]find
Will [D7]I ever [G]be the [C]man I want to [G]be
Or for[C]gotten footprints [G]in the [D7]sands of [G]time
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
As I'm walking down the [C]road my thoughts keep [G]running back to you
And I hope it's in your heart to under[D7]stand
Though [G]you never made me [C]sorry for the [G]love I gave to you
I'm just sorry that I'm [D7]not your kind of [G]man
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Oh [D7]where will I [G]be when [C]tomorrow wakens [G]me
Am I [C]looking for a [D7]dream I'll never [G]find
Will [D7]I ever [G]be the [C]man I want to [G]be
Or for[C]gotten footprints [G]in the [D7]sands of [G]time
