{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]The church door was opened  and I stepped [G7]inside
I went there hoping  that she'd change her [C]mind
There were beautiful roses  in a bridal [F][C7]bouquet
Where she stood at the [C]alter  in a [G7]veil of white [C]lace
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
A stranger in silence  reached out for her [G7]hand
And placed on her finger  a gold wedding [C]band
There was happiness written  in the [C7]smile on his [F]face
But I couldn't [C]see hers beneath the [G7]veil of white [C]lace
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I pitied that stranger  for all he could [G7]see
Was their life together  until [C]eternity
My heart filled with anger  as I [C7]pictured the [F]face
Of a false hearted [C]quitter  beneath a [G7]veil of white [C]lace
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I reached in my pocket  when the wedding was [G7]done
My hand touched a locket  then it fell on a [C]gun
It shattered the silence  as it [C7]left its [F]trace
Stains of red [C]crimson  on a [G7]veil of white [C]lace
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I ran from the church house  as I threw down the [G7]gun
But stopped on the door step  for there crossing the [C]lawn
My darling said she had  [C7]decided to [F]wait
Death to a [C]stranger  beneath a [G7]veil of white [C]lace
{end_of_verse}
