{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]He's got a U S flag on his front porch
To [F]remind everyone where he [C]lives
And up [F]in the attic there are papers that [C]prove
The [Am]old house is finally [G7]his
After [Em]thirty-five years the grass still don't [F]grow
In that [Dm]rock hard west [Am]Texas [C]ground
Where [F]my old dad still [C]clings to that old [G7][F]coyote [C]town
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Like [Em]horses the pick-ups are parked out in [F]front
Of a [Em]cafe that don't need a [F]name
Where the old [Am]men rock and the tumbleweeds [C]roll
Past the [F]boarded up windows down [G7]Main
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]Waist high weeds hide a for sale sign
At the [F]drive-in where my innocence [C]died
With a rusty [F]advertisement dangling by a [C]nail
Says [Am]popcorn and Pepsi for a [G7]dime
And [Em]down at the depot where I left for [F]good
There's a [Dm]hobo with his [Am]three-legged [C]hound
Waiting [F]for a train that no [C]longer comes to that old [G7][F]coyote [C]town
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
And the [Em]interstate rumbles like a river that [F]runs
To a [Em]rhythm that don't ever slow [F]down
As [Am]cars and trucks and time pass [C]by 
That [F]old coyote [G7]town
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[C]Daddy falls asleep in the living room
On [F]the sofa with the TV [C]on
Sometimes [F]he waits for a phone call from [C]me
[Am]Sometimes he waits too [G7]long
But I [Em]still think of the people and the place that he [F]loves
How much [Dm]longer will they [Am]be [C]around
Till its [F]ashes to ashes [C]dust to dust for that old [G7][F]coyote [C]town
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Like [Em]horses the pick-ups are parked out in [F]front
Of a [Em]cafe that don't need a [F]name
Where the old [Am]men rock and the tumbleweeds [C]roll
Past the [F]boarded up windows down [G7]Main
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
[Em]And the interstate rumbles like a river that [F]runs
To a [Em]rhythm that don't ever slow [F]down
As [Am]cars and trucks and time pass [C]by 
That [F]old coyote [C]town
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
God bless that [F]old coyote [C]town
{end_of_verse}
