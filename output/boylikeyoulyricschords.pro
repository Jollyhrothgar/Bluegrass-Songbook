{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]There's a jukebox [D7]in my [G]ear playin' so loud I can [C]hardly [G]hear
It's tellin' a [D7]story about a boy like [G]you
And each selection [D7]that I [G]make tells me how my [C]heart will [G]break
For fallin' in [D7]love with a boy like [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Though it's [D7]just an ol' machine without a [C]heart but oh so [G]mean
It says I'll probably spend my whole life feelin' [D7]blue
So I'll [G]put in [D7]one more [G]dime and play that same song [C]one more [G]time
Cause I wanna [D7]hear about a boy like [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Though it's [D7]just an ol' machine without a [C]heart but oh so [G]mean
It says I'll probably spend my whole life feelin' [D7]blue
I know [G]that I should [D7]go on [G]home but I can't stand [C]to be [G]alone
Cause I always [D7]dream about a boy like [G]you
Yes I always [D7]dream about a boy like [G]you
{end_of_verse}
