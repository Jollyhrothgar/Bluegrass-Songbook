[G]Your lips warm me like wine and [G7]your love is oh so sweet
And I [C]just gotta see you one more [G]time
But we both know I'm no good I'd settle [G7]down if I could
So let me [G]love you one more [D7]time then let me [G]go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Let me go  [C]set me [G]free
To say these words to you sweetheart is killing [D7]me
To leave [G]your arms I'd rather die
But I'm no [G7]good for you that's why
Let me [G]love you one more [D7]time then let me [G]go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
A girl like you is hard to find
But you're too [G7]good for love like mine
You may [C]think you want me now but give it [G]time
You'll learn to hate my wandering ways
The lonely [G7]nights and empty days
So let me [G]love you one more [D7]time then let me [G]go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Let me go  [C]set me [G]free
To say these words to you sweetheart is killing [D7]me
To leave [G]your arms I'd rather die
But I'm no [G7]good for you that's why
Let me [G]love you one more [D7]time then let me [G]go
