{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]There's a lighthouse on a hillside that [F]overlooks the [C]sea
When I'm tossed it sends out a light [D7]that I might [G7]see
But the [C]light that shines in darkness now will [F]safely lead us [C]o'er
If it wasn't for the lighthouse [G7]my ship would be no [C]more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
And I thank God for the lighthouse I [F]owe my life to [C]Him
For Jesus is the lighthouse and [D7]from the rocks of [G7]sin
He has [C]shown a light around me that [F]I can clearly [C]see
If it wasn't for the lighthouse tell me [G7]where would this ship [C]be
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus: Repeat 1}
And I thank God for the lighthouse I [F]owe my life to [C]Him
For Jesus is the lighthouse and [D7]from the rocks of [G7]sin
He has [C]shown a light around me that [F]I can clearly [C]see
If it wasn't for the lighthouse tell me [G7]where would this ship [C]be
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus: Repeat 2}
And I thank God for the lighthouse I [F]owe my life to [C]Him
For Jesus is the lighthouse and [D7]from the rocks of [G7]sin
He has [C]shown a light around me that [F]I can clearly [C]see
If it wasn't for the lighthouse tell me [G7]where would this ship [C]be
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Everybody that lives about us says [F]tear that lighthouse [C]down
The big ships don't sail this way anymore 
There's [D7]no use of it standing '[G7]round
And my [C]mind goes back to the stormy night
When [F]just in time [C]I saw the light
Yes the light from that old lighthouse
That [G7]stands up there on the [C]hill
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
And I thank God for the lighthouse I [F]owe my life to [C]Him
For Jesus is the lighthouse and [D7]from the rocks of [G7]sin

If it wasn't for the lighthouse tell me [G7]where would this ship [C]be
