{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]May this tenderness cling when the [G7]fire of spring is a [C]memory
May you [D7]still be my own when a hundred years have [G]flown
But if it can't be give this [G7]moment to me [C]while our dream is bright
Put your sweet arms [G]around me  [D7]and love me [G]tonight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Love me [D7]tonight let me feel your lips on [G]mine
And though I [Em]pray forever and a [A7]day I'll be possessing [D7]you
I'll confess to [C]you if I [G]knew that our love would be [G7]gone
With the stars in the [C]dawn's gray light
I'd still hold you close and [G]whisper  [D7]love me to[G]night
{end_of_verse}
