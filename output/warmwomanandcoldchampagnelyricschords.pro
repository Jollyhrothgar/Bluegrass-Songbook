[G]I spent a lot of lonely nights when [C]she walked out the door

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And it's warm women [C]and cold cham[A7]pagne
That's [D7]all I need to get me back on my feet [G]again
When you mix sweet love with booze

So give me [D7]warm women and lots of cold cham[G]pagne

New friends and new faces with [C]words of good cheer
Make it [D7]hard to think about her in a party atmos[G]phere
So goodbye blues and hello love the [C]name of my new game
Su[D7]rrounded by warm women and ice cold cham[G]pagne
