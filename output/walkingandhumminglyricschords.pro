{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I feel so alone as I [F]walk from my [C]home
With no one to help me share my [G7]blues
Oh [C]what could be worse than be born [F]with a [C]curse
That everything you [G7]love you always [C]lose
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I'd feel better inside if I [F]opened up and [C]cried
But I guess I'm one of those that just can't [G7]cry
So [C]I’ll just walk and hum wait [F]for the day to [C]come
When I can [G7]lay down and [C]die
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I don’t feel [F]like [C]talking
I [F]just feel like [G7]walking
[F]And keep on a [C]humming
Hum [F]hum hum [C]hummm 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Maybe someday you'll know what it [F]means to feel [C]low
When the one you love turns you from the [G7]door
You [C]won't want to eat you'll [F]ache down to your [C]feet
All you'll do is [G7]hum and walk the [C]floor
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
You won’t feel [F]like [C]talking
You [F]just feel like [G7]walking
[F]And keep on a [C]humming
Hum [F]hum hum [C]hummm 
{end_of_verse}
