{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Well I guess you must have had [D7]a change of [G]heart 
You don't [C]treat me like you used [G7]to at the [C]start
You're campaign of love was quite a work of [G]art
But I guess you must have had [D7]a change of [G]heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Guess I took too much for [D7]granted [G]anyway
But it's [C]just cause I'd [G7]believe those things you'd [C]say
Not so long ago you'd swore we'd never [G]part
Well I guess you must have had [D7]a change of [G]heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well goodbye to all those [D7]castles in the [G]air
And goodbye [C]to all the [G7]plans we used to [C]share
They were fragments of a dream that fell [G]apart
Now they're gone because you had [D7]a change of [G]heart
They're all gone because you had [D7]a change of [G]heart
{end_of_verse}
