Even A Fool Would Let Go
By John Anderson
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G7]It's funny how [C]love goes
Cause I [Am]know this will never work [Dm]out
But [G7]honey my love [C]grows
Even [Am]though there's no reason to [Dm]doubt  [G7]this can never [C]be  
[G7]You keep sayin' it's [C]wrong
Neither of [G7]us is [C]free and [Dm]still I want to [F]hold on [G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And even a [C]fool would let go
When he [Am]knows that there's no use in [C]tryin'
Even a [Dm]child would say no
When he knows that it'd end up [G7]crying
Tell me [Am]now is it [F]worth holding [D7]you
When [G7]even a fool would let [C]go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[G7]Our love is no [C]reason
Like the [Am]words in a song that don't [Dm]rhyme
Our [G7]love's got no [C]season
I [Am]just know that it's there all the [Dm]time  [G7]baby just you and [C]me  
[G7]I can't believe that it's [C]wrong
Thinkin' '[G7]bout you and [C]me it [Dm]makes me want to [F]hold on [G7]
