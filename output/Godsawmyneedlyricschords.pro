{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I grew up reciting bible [D7]verses
Committing everyone to memo[G]ry
But like [Em]Nicodemus when he [C]met the [G]teacher 
I could [A7]finally see the pharaohcy in [D7]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I have [G]always believed I [D7]believed in
The right things to do and to [G]say
But like [Em]Paul I was travel[C]ing and [G]blinded [C]
Till I [G]saw the light the [D7]truth and the [G]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
In the darkness [C]God saw my [G]need
Saw my sorrow my [Em]lust and my [D7]greed
Just one [G]touch of His [C]hand I was [G]free
In my darkness [D7]God saw my [G]need
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus: Repeat 1}
In the darkness [C]God saw my [G]need

In my darkness [D7]God saw my [G]need
{end_of_chorus}

{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I could name you every book in the [D7]bible
And I knew all the pretty words it took to [G]pray
But like [Em]Zacchaeus I was [C]short on things that [G]mattered
Still the [A7]Lord stopped in at my house one [D7]day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Ah it's [G]a thin thin line between a [D7]good man
And one who knows he’s been [G]saved
Like [Em]Lazarus I’m [C]now a friend of [G]Jesus [C]
And this [G]body is all I'm [D7]taking to the [G]grave
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
In the darkness [C]God saw my [G]need
Saw my sorrow my [Em]lust and my [D7]greed
Just one [G]touch of His [C]hand I was [G]free
In my darkness [D7]God saw my [G]need
{end_of_chorus}
