Recorded Dale Watson
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]Hello I'm an [G7]old country [C]song 
I [F]ain't been around in a [C]while 
But it ain't like I'd [G7]really been [C]gone 
I'm more [D7]like an old suit that's just [G7]gone out of style 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Hey I [C]heard you found [G7]somebody [C]new 
Someone [F]younger more hip more [C]alive 
[F]Not much to say so I [C]just lift [F]away 
Till I [C]slid off your [G7]radio [C]dial 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I'm [F]here if you ever [C]want me 
An old [G7]friend you forgot that you [C]had 
If those [F]yearnings ever [C]haunt you 
[F]Lend an [C]ear I'll [G7]give you a [C]hand 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
We’ve been through a [G7]lot you and [C]I 
We've [F]cursed we've laughed we've [C]cried 
Through [F]love and divorce and the [C]horrors of war 
When the [D7]young ones were born and the [G7]old folks they died 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
[C]Sometimes I hit [G7]too close to [C]home 
And the [F]truth ain't what you want to [C]hear 
We're old [F]friends you and I I wouldn't [C]tell you a [F]lie 
[C]Even if it [G7]spared you a [C]tear 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Hey I [C]heard you found [G7]somebody [C]new 
Someone [F]younger more hip more [C]alive 
[F]Not much to say so I [C]just lift [F]away 
Till I [C]slid off your [G7]radio [C]dial 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Perhaps I'm too [G7]sad and for[C]lorn 
A [F]product of some bygone [C]age 
A little too [G7]haggard and [C]worn 
Since I [D7]kicked out the footlights and [G7]walked off the stage 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
[C]I thought I'd just [G7]drop you a [C]line 
And let you [F]know hey I'm still [C]around 
If you're [F]ever in need just [C]listen to [F]me 
And say [C]hello to that [G7]old country [C]song 
{end_of_verse}
