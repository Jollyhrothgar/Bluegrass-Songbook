{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I don't want my golden slippers when I [F]reach my heaven's [C]home
I just want to see my Jesus sitting [D7]there upon his [G7]throne
I don't [C]want no fancy mansions just a [F]place to rest my [C]head
Where I rest in peace eternal when I [G7]pay my earthly [C]debt
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I don't want my golden slippers when I [F]enter heaven's [C]door
I'll be free to sing his praises where the [D7]sun shines ever[G7]more
Just a [C]plain and simple cottage down the [F]street from Jesus' [C]door
Where I'll visit with my loved ones who have [G7]journeyed on be[C]fore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I don't want my golden slippers just a [F]plain and simple [C]shoe
I don't want my golden pathways just a [D7]country road will [G7]do
Love to [C]see the devil tremble when he [F]sees me on my [C]knees
I don't want my golden slippers I'm just [G7]longing to be [C]free
{end_of_verse}
