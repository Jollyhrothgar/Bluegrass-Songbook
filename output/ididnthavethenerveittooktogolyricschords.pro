{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I’ve always tried to tell you that someday I’d [G7]change
That I wouldn’t let you hurt me any[C]more
But you would laugh and say that I would stay the [G7]same
That I didn’t have the nerve it took to [C]go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I’ve [F]locked the house and in the mailbox is the [C]key
I only took the things that are my [G7]own
[C]You’ll regret the words sweetheart you’ve often said to [G7]me
That I didn’t have the nerve it took to [C]go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Every step I take I leave a tear in its [G7]place
I know that without you I can’t go [C]on
But in my mind I hear the same ol’ things you told [G7]me
That I didn’t have the nerve it took to [C]go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I’ve [F]taken back the key and I’ve unlocked the [C]door
I realized that pride I can’t live [G7]on 
I [C]guess that in my heart you were right all [G7]along
That I didn’t have the nerve it took to [C]go
{end_of_verse}
