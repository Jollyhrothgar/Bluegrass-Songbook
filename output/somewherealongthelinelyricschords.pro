{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Somewhere along the [C]line I lost my love for [G]you
I can't [C]explain just why [G]I feel the way I [D7]do
I only want [G]to know what made my love grow [C]cold
What made me [G]change my mind [D7]somewhere along the [G]line
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The happiness I've [C]known no longer lives with [G]me
I hold a [C]passion for [G]the yearning to be [D7]free
Whatever [G]caused the change has left this mark so [C]strange
My eyes for [G]love went blind [D7]somewhere along the [G]line
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well it [C]might have been the night you tossed your wedding rings [G]away
[A7]And it could have been the many little things I meant to [D7]say
[G]A mystery I know I can't [C]define 
For I [G]lost my love for you [D7]somewhere along the [G]line
[D7]Somewhere along the [G]line
{end_of_verse}
