{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Now listen while I tell you 'bout a place I know
Down in Tennessee where the tall corn [G7]grows
[C]Hidden from the world in a bunch of pines
[D7]Where the moon's a little bashful and it seldom [G]shines
[D7]Civilized people live there alright
Ah but they all go native on Saturday [G]Night 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh well the music is a fiddle and a cracked guitar
They get their kicks from an old fruit [G7]jar
[C]They do the boogie to an old square dance
[D7]The woods are full of couples looking for [G]romance
[D7]They struggle and they shuffle till broad daylight 
Yes they all go native on Saturday [G]night 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
When they really get together there's a lot of fun
They all know the other fellow packs a [G7]gun 
[C]Everybody does his best to act just right 
[D7]Cause there's gonna be funeral if you start a [G]fight 
[D7]Somebody takes a brogan and knocks out the light 
Yes they all go native on Saturday [G]night
