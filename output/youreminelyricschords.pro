{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I won't say that I'm the only one who [D7]loves you
I can't say I make you happy all the [G]time
There's someone you [D7]can't for[G]get you [C]never will and yet
As [D7]far as my heart’s concerned you're [G]mine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You never once have told me that you [D7]need me
And you forget when I'm around you some[G]times
There are words I [D7]try to [G]say when you [C]turn and walk away
But as [D7]far as my heart’s concerned you're [G]mine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
You're [D7]mine and yet I know someday I'll [C]lose [G]you
But [D7]you can't take this happiness I've [G]found
I [D7]know it may sound foolish when I [C]tell [G]you
That I'm satisfied just having you [D7]around
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[G]Even when you're in my arms I know you're [D7]lonely
Wish that I could take that someone all for [G]mine
But it seems you [D7]can't for[G]get you [C]never will and yet
As [D7]far as my heart’s concerned you're [G]mine
{end_of_verse}
