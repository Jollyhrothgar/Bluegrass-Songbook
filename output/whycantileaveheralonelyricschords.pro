Just [C]kills me  oh it [G7]kills me

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I've [C]dropped by her momma's stoned out of my mind
Just to [F]hear that it's over from her one more time
As [G7]if I didn't see that red Chevy not slowing down
Loaded down and rolling down [F]our road
Yeah she's [Dm]already left
So [G7]why can't I leave her [C]alone
{end_of_verse}

Back[F]sliding [C]hiding [F]away from the truth
Until the [C]tears run oh here [G7]comes one
