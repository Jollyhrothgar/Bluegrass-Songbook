{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]My heart is a playground and a [D7]hobby horse of love
You make my hopes skyrocket [G]into the stars above
But then you take and [G7]knock me down [C]just like a bowling pin
I [D7]guess I'm just a sideshow till the main event [G]begins
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You [C]spin me like a [G]tilt-a-whirl I'm [D7]dizzy as a [G]clown
I'm [C]living in the [G]jilted world I'm [A7]on a merry-go-[D7]round
The [G]wheel of fortune [G7]slowly turns and [C]shows I lose again
My [D7]heart is a playground where you walk out and [G]in
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
My heart is a playground and a [D7]hobby horse of love
My kisses are like scooter cars [G]that you just bump and shove
You've got me on a [G7]loop-a-plane I'm [C]really upside down
My [D7]heart is like a fun house where you just play [G]around
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I'm [C]riding on a [G]Ferris-wheel [D7]getting nowhere [G]fast
Like [C]eatin' cotton [G]candy I [A7]knew it just couldn't [D7]last
Our [G]roll-a-coaster [G7]love affair was [C]just a holiday
My [D7]heart is a playground where you laugh and walk [G]away
{end_of_verse}
