{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]God bless my daddy I learned so much from him
He taught me at an early age I had to sink or [G7]swim 
He said [C]boy that old river of life can wash away your [F]dreams
But you [C]gotta keep right on [G7]kicking and swimming up[C]stream
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Before I knew it I was out there on the street
That old gal they call lady luck she wasn't kind to [G7]me
As a [C]matter of fact you could say she was downright [F]mean
She [C]kept me in way over my [G7]head and swimming up[C]stream
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Swimming upstream swimming upstream
Fightin' every inch of the way for a poor boy's [G7]dream
Things'll get [C]rough times'll get [F]lean
But the [C]only choice you [G7]got is to keep swimming up[C]stream
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Every time I think my ship is comin' in
That old tide will turn and it'll take it back out [G7]again
If I [C]just lay back and float I'll be in trouble you [F]see
So I [C]gotta keep working and [G7]kicking a swimming up[C]stream
