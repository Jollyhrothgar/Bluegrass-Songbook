{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[D7]When I get to [G]thinking [D7]about the [G]past
And all of the [C]good things that were too good to [G]last
I cry in my heart for [A7]each little part
[D7]Of yesterday's [G]love ([C]yesterday's [G]love)
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[D7]A few tender [G]moments [D7]when heaven was [G]mine
The vows that you [C]whispered with each kiss was [G]divine
How empty they seem they're [A7]lost in a dream
[D7]With yesterday's [G]love ([C]yesterday's [G]love)
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Somewhere [C]I lost you [D7]along the [G]way
Lost [D7]without knowing the price that I'd [G]pay
I can't help but [C]wonder how things would have [G]been
If I could start [A7]over and try it [D7]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
But love has its [G]problems [D7]and bridges to [G]burn
You have to cross [C]over and you never [G]return
For dreams have their day [A7]and then fade away
[D7]With yesterday's [G]love [C]yesterday's [G]love
{end_of_verse}
