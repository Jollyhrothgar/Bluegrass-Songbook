{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Mom and Dad want me to have a college edu[D7]cation
But I disagree and if you were me
You would [C]see my sit[G]uation
Because I have gone and fell in love
So I might as well [C]confess
[D7]I don't want a PHD
I just want to be an MR[G]S

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[D7]I don't want a PHD
But I [C]don't want an [G]MA
[A7]All I want is the man I love
And [D7]we'll work it out someway
[G]ABC's don't interest me
I'm ready to say [C]yes
[D7]I don't want a PHD
I just want to be an MR[G]S

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I can't be the way I want
With my head stuck in a [D7]book
I just want to be his wife
And [C]learn to sew and [G]cook
I'd rather make love by candle light
Than study for a [C]test
[D7]I don't want a PHD
I just want to be an MR[G]S
