{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]My transistor radio comes from far [D7]away
And when it's night over here over there it's a breaking [G]day
I remember all the good times I had walking in the [D7]sand
With a beautiful girl that I met made in [G]Japan
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The beauty of her face was beyond my wildest [D7]dreams
Like cherry blossoms blooming in the mountains in the early [G]spring
As we walked by the river and she softly took hold of my [D7]hand
That's when I fell deep in love with a girl made in [G]Japan
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
In the dark of night we would lay on Tokyo [D7]bay
And the singing of the birds woke us up at the break of [G]day
Her smiling eyes always seemed to try to [D7]understand
All the love in my heart for the girl made in [G]Japan
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
My transistor radio comes from far [D7]away
And when it's night over here over there it's a breaking [G]day
She cried when she said she'd been promised to another [D7]man
That's when I left my heart with the girl made in [G]Japan
[D7]Yes my heart will always be with the girl made in [G]Japan
{end_of_verse}
