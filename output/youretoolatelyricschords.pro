{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]If I had some[C]one that's [G]true
It would [C]thrill me through and [G]through
I'd be happy [C]oh so [G]happy night and [D7]day
Seems each [G]one has a perfect mate
But for [C]me I’m always [G]late
And it kills my soul to [D7]hear my sweetheart [G]say
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Too [D7]late too late you're too [G]late
I have [D7]waited oh so long
But you [C]never did come [G]home
So just go on [D7]alone you're too [G]late
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I have built my [C]castles [G]high
Just to [C]watch them fade and [G]die
Makes me wonder [C]if I [G]really have a [D7]mate
But I’ll keep [G]looking o'er the hills
For some[C]one and I always [G]will
But maybe it’s just my [D7]fate to be too [G]late
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Too [D7]late too late you're too [G]late
When I [D7]search for heaven’s door
I hope these [C]words won’t ring no [G]more
And a voice say here’s a [D7]gate but you’re too [G]late
{end_of_verse}
