{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G7]Well I [C]don't believe I've ever felt so [F]lonely
And my [C]heart is never hurt this bad [D7]before[G7]
I woke [C]up this morning to find 
My one and [F]only sayin' good[C]bye
Said she wouldn't be [D7]hangin' a[G7]round no [C]more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
My baby walked [F]out on me this morning
Left me [C]behind now I'm lonely and wonderin'
If maybe there were [G7]something I could do
To make her [C]change her mind and stay
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
This wonderin' [F]why my baby left me
Is breakin' my [C]heart and it's driving me crazy
She didn't say [G7]why she was sayin' goodbye
She just walked [C]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I guess I'd be a fool to keep on [F]tryin'
Cause I [C]know that it won't do no good no-[D7]how [G7]
It's [C]already passed the point of her [F]return
I know that it's [C]true
I guess I'd be better [D7]off to [G7]forget her [C]somehow
{end_of_verse}
