{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]The moon was a [D7]thin slice of [G]silver
Sailing the [G7]dark southern [Am]skies
An old flame still burned in my [D7]memory
Long after we said [G]goodbye
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
They say love can [D7]rise from the [G]ashes
If the moon and the [G7]moment are [Am]right
But I never dreamed it could [D7]happ[G]en
Till I [C]ran into [D7]you to[G]night
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G7]A new moon is [C]shining [D7] an old flame is [G]burning [G7]
Nights for [C]believing [D7]a dream can come [G]t-ru[G7]e
Whirling [C]around us [D7] weaving it's [G]magic [G7]
A [C]new moon  an [D7]old flame  and [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
We laughed and we [D7]talked about [G]old times
What we'd been [G7]doing since [Am]then
As time passed you moved ever [D7]closer
And I felt those feelings [G]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I wondered where [D7]all this was [G]leading
Till the moment we [G7]touched and I [Am]knew
Love was still there and just [D7]wait[G]ing
For a [C]new moon an [D7]old flame and [G]you
