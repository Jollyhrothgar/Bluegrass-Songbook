[C]You can buy you a house and a big shiny car
You can go without but you won't get to far
[G7]Cause you need someone to see you through
Someone to tell you it's [C]alright
And you [G7]get back what you've given
And love is somethin' you can't [C]buy
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You can wear your fancy clothes and all those diamond rings
You can go where you go but it won't mean a thing
[G7]Till you find someone to see you through
Someone to tell you it's [C]alright
And you [G7]get back what you've given
And love is somethin' you can't [C]buy
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Your [F]world is turnin' it's turnin' upside [C]down

You [C]get everything you see and you wonder why
What you got you don't need and you can't be satisfied
{end_of_verse}
