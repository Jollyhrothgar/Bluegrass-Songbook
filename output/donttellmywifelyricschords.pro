{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Don’t tell my wife who wrote this song cause she might leave [G7]me
If she found out I’m pouring words into this [C]pen
Maybe time we’ll work things out without her [F]knowing
Cause [G7]I’m not sure of her even though she’s back [C]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
She’s proved to me a hundred times she’s really [G7]sorry
But there’s still something between us deep [C]within
I know I love her could it be trust that’s [F]missing
Cause [G7]I’m not sure of her even though she’s back [C]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]She’s back again and I’m so [G7]happy cause I worshiped [C]her
But [G7]somehow it’s not the same as [C]before
And [F]tonight a cold sweat [G7]broke out all over [C]me
When [D7]she was just ten minutes late getting home from the [G7]store
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]Don’t tell my wife who wrote this song I’ll find the [G7]answer
But I know the chance to save our home is [C]thin
There’s something gone and I’m afraid it’s gone [F]forever
And [G7]I’m not sure of her even though she’s back [C]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
No [G7]I’m not sure of her even though she’s back [C]again
{end_of_verse}
