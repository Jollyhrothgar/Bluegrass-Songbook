{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Well I sit here all alone no one's [F]gonna do me [C]wrong tonight[Fm]
It seems I've [C]been through it all 
And there's [F]no one I could call to get it [C]right[Fm]
And every[C]where I go everyone seems so settled [F]in 
And sure of where they're [Am]going
Well I don't [F]know what I need since [G7]I've been freed
I'm a [Am]horse without a rid[G7]er [F]
And there's no one [G7]left to take the [C]lead[Fm]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And [F]I've been loving [C]blind [F]loving every heart I could call [C]mine
[F]I've been loving [C]blind so [F]sure there was something I could [C]find[F]
But I just couldn't [C]see [F]there was [G7]nothing there for [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Now there's a smile on my face no [F]there's no trace of the [C]pain[Fm]
I know I've [C]been through it all 
And I [F]know those tears won't fall [C]again[Fm]
But oh the [C]times I thought someone's heart I'd caught
Well I was [F]fooled oh and I [Am]regret
I was [F]so naive oh and [G7]I'd believe them when they'd [Am]tell me[G7]   [F]
That's as [G7]good as love can [C]get [Fm]
