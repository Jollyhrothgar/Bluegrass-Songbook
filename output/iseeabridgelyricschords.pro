{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I see a bridge a way to [Am]cross the [G7]river of [C]strife [F]river of [C]strife
I'm not smart I'm not strong many [F]deeds I’ve done were [C]wrong
And my heart is often [Am]drear when troubles [D7]appear [G7]
But when the [C]night is dark and long oh how [F]peaceful is the [C]dawn
I see a bridge a way to [Am]cross the [G7]river of [C]strife [F]river of [C]strife
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
When the [F]valley I must cross is so [C]dark I lose my way
When the [F]river is so wide my [D7]courage fails[G7]
I see a [C]bridge straight and wide spanning [F]o'er the raging [C]tide
I see a bridge a way to [Am]cross all [G7]trouble and [C]strife [F]trouble and [C]strife
Spoken:
[F]As I journey through this life its days and its nights
I [C]know I must cross dark and lonely [F]valleys
When at times the path is so dim I can hardly find my way
And [D7]great rivers of [G7]trials and tribulations
Will cross the narrow [C]road that I feebly travel
But I will feel no danger [F]for I'm never alone nor [C]forsaken
With faith I shall look up and see a [Am]bridge
Yet there will [G7]always [C]be a way provided [F]for my [C]escape
