{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I'm not looking for a [F]sweetheart  just [G7]a gentle lady [C]friend
Someone I can softly [G7]turn to  when I need to now and [C]then
When my head gets kinda [F]tangled  and my soul is laying [C]bare
I reach over in the [G7]corner of my life  and I find you waiting [C]there
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You're a number I can [F]phone  you're a letter I can [C]write
You're my water when I'm [G7]thirsty  in the middle of the [C]night
You're a warm and tender [F]body  you're a woman not a [C]wife
And just knowing you has [G7]brightened  the corner of my [C]life
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
There's a special kind of [F]feeling  [G7]when we're simply touching [C]hands
There's a special kind of [G7]comfort  knowing someone [C]understands
I'm no knight in shining [F]armor  I'll never carry you [C]away
But you're filling up the [G7]corner of my life  in the nicest kind of [C]way
