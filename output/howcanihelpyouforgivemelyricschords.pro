{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]As morning breaks and I awake [G7]my eyes open wide
To see the sunlight melting all the [C]dreams I had last night
A memory flashes through the cobwebs [F]of my tangled mind
In [G7]search the clues for what to do to leave the past [C]behind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
How can [G7]I help you for[C]give me
How can [G7]I ever for[C]get you
Wild thoughts of you run through my mind 
Like [F]rivers to the sea
How can [G7]I help you for[C]give me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Darkness falls and lonely calls and [G7]I'm alone again
Wishing I could turn around and [C]see you walkin' in
Then I lay me down to weep and [F]wonder what to do
To [G7]let you know I love you so I never meant to [C]hurt you
