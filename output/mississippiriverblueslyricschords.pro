{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Oh you Mississippi river with [F]waters so deep and [C]wide
My [G7]thoughts of you keep rising just like an evening [C]tide  
I'm [F]just like a seagull that's left the [C]sea
Oh your [G7]muddy waters keep on calling [C]me  
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I'm gonna [F]pack my grip and head that way
You'll see me [C]hanging round again some day
Cause I know [G7]that's the only way to lose
The Mississippi river [C]blues
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I've often ridden on your bosom from [F]Memphis down to New O[C]rleans
Floating [G7]over muddy waters drifting through familiar [C]scenes  
And when I [F]hear that whistle of an old steam [C]boat
Down that [G7]Mississippi river again I'm a going to [C]float   
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I'm gonna [F]pack my grip and head that way
You'll see me [C]hanging round again some day
Cause I know [G7]that's the only way to lose
The Mississippi river [C]blues
