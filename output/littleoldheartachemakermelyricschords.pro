{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Well I left a little girl out in Frisco 
Countin’ the days till I get back
And a [F]girl I used to know in Buffalo 
Threw herself on the railroad track
Now [G7]who do you think is the one 
That’s causing all of this misery
Just that little old heartache maker [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Everywhere I’ve been I’ve left a sting of broken hearts behind
[F]East and west north and south of the Mason Dixon line
Now [G7]who do you guess is making this mess 
Well that’s pretty plain to see
Just that little old heartache maker [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now [G7]from what I’ve said I bet you think 
That I’m [C]kinda low down and mean
But [D7]I’ve never done anything to anybody 
That I [G7]didn’t want done to me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]All I really want is a little place a wife to call my own
I [F]had one once but her old man came and took her on back home
Now [G7]I don’t want the name I’ve got but I guess I’ll always be
Just that little old heartache maker [C]me
{end_of_verse}
