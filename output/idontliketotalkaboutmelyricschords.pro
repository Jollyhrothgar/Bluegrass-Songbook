{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G7]I just walked through the [C]door asking questions [F]again
Because I’ve got no [G7]answers only that I’ve [C]been
The [G7]mirror won’t tell a [C]lie it will show what it [F]sees
But you ain’t asking [G7]why I don’t like to talk about [C]me [G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
No I [C]don’t like to talk about [F]me 
Or [Dm]remember my [G7]whole used to [C]be [G7]
I guess [C]sometimes that I ought to [F]see
Cause [Dm]I don’t like to [G7]talk about [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G7]Sure I’ll just go [C]again tell you just how I [F]feel
I’m just scared of the [G7]outcome [Dm]cause I’ve never been [C]real
I [G7]feel like running right [C]now and make the easy way [F]out
Yeah I’m fast on my [G7]feet but I don’t like to talk about [C]me [G7]
