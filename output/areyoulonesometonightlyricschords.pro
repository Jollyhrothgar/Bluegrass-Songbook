{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Are you lonesome tonight do you miss me tonight 
Are you sorry we [A7]drifted [Dm]apart 
Does your [G7]memory stray to a brighter sunny day
When I [Dm]kissed you and [G7]called you sweet[C]heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Do the [C7]chairs in your parlor seem [F]empty and bare 
[Cm]Do you [D7]gaze at your doorstep and [G7]picture me there 
Is your [C]heart filled with pain shall I [D7]come back again 
Tell me [G7]dear are you lonesome [C]tonight
Recitation: 
I wonder if you're lonesome tonight
You know someone said that the worlds a stage
And each must play a part
Fate had me playing in love you as my sweet heart
Act one was when we met I loved you at first glance
You read your line so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came act two you seemed to change and you acted strange
And why I've never known
Honey you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than go on living without you
Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you wont come back to me
Then make them bring the curtain down
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G7]Is your [C]heart filled with pain 
Shall I [D7]come back again
Tell me [G7]dear are you lonesome to[C]night
{end_of_verse}
