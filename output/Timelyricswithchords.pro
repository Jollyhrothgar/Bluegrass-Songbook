{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Who knows why the wind blows [D7]who knows where it ends
[Am]Who can say how long it takes to [C]come around again
But I [Em]guess you had to ride it as [Bm]far as you could go
[Am]It might bring you [C]back this way [D7]time only knows
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But time doesn't [G]hear and time doesn't [D7]care 
Time doesn't [Em]wait no time isn't [C]fair
Time is a [G]healer time is a [D7]thief 
And every[Em]thing it steals it [C]keeps
Can you just cruise on [G]down the [D7]line 
And there's [C]nothing [G]left be[D7]hind but [C]time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G]Who knows all the reasons two [D7]people drift apart
[Am]I used to always feel you here right [C]up against my heart
But [Em]wind can change directions oh [Bm]you could change your mind
[Am]I could learn to [C]heal this heart in [D7]time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[G]But time doesn't hear [D7]and time doesn't care 
Time doesn't [Em]wait no time isn't [C]fair
Time is a [G]healer time is a [D7]thief 
And every[Em]thing it steals it [C]keeps
It just moves on [G]down the [D7]line 
And there's [C]nothing [G]left be[D7]hind but [G]time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[C]Time moves too [G]slowly time slips [D7]away
There's a lot of [Em]things time won't [C]replace
It just moves on [G]down the [D7]line 
And there's [C]nothing [G]left be[D7]hind but [C]time
Nothing but [G]time
{end_of_verse}
