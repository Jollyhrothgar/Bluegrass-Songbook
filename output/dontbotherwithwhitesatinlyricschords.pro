{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I've [G7]walked a starlit mountain road
Felt the [F]earth turn when I'm [C]high
Heard a [F]universe that's singing
I'm [C]not afraid to die
Is there [F]really any difference
On this [G7]earth for me or [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
So don't [A#7]bother with white satin
When my old [F]blue jeans will [C]do
In[Am]side my mind I feel
The singing [F]ocean's mighty [C]call
Of soft breezes [F]gentle waves
That shelter one and [Dm]all
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
From the [G7]rocky land we cling to
As [C]if we didn't know
Where [Dm]all that lives has come from
[G7]In the end we'll [C]know
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Why the [Am]fear and why the sorrow
Yester[F]day is but to[C]day
That we dreamed of [F]in our [C]childhood 
And now a word put [Dm]away
For a [G7]promise of tomorrow 
And [C]all too soon we’ll know
That the [Dm]circle meets and here we stand
We [G7]said that long [C]ago
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
As I [G7]traveled in my mind
And reached the [F]stars as they came [C]near
Built the [F]universe of beauty 
And it’s [C]banished all my fears 
Lay me [F]anywhere you will
And I’ll [G7]still be part of [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
So don’t [A#7]bother with white satin 
When my [F]old jeans will [C]do
So don’t [A#7]bother with white satin 
When my [F]old jeans [G7]will [C]do
{end_of_verse}
