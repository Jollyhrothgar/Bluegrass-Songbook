[C]I went to see my honeydew she [F]lived just down the way
[C]I got stuck and the truck froze up and I [F]only got half [C]way

The [C]rain won't stop it's a beatin' on the top 
And [F]should have stayed at [C]home

Must have been a half a day be[F]fore I got back home
[C]The roads all mud the creeks gonna flood and [F]I'm here all a[C]lone
Sure feels good a gettin' back to [F]my old shack again
But [C]I'm all soaked and the radios broke and the [F]rain keeps pouring [C]in
