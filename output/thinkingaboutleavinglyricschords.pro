{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I used to think love was the [G7]soft rope meant to tie me [C]down
And all that could ever own me was a [G7]guitar and another [C]town
[F]Ten years can disappear real fast 
When every [C]morning just leaves somewhere else [F]behind
But I've been [C]thinking about leaving [G7]long enough to change my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Lyin' here beside you I can [G7]feel it start to pull me [C]away
The thought I'll have again tomorrow that [G7]just came back from yester[C]day
But [F]your embrace makes any reason for those [C]memories hard to [F]find
And I've been [C]thinking about leaving [G7]long enough to change my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Some[F]times I miss the warm bright lights some[C]times I miss the crowds
Some[F]times I miss the women I [C]wrapped each song [G7]around
Some[F]times I miss that world out there so [C]empty hard and un[F]kind
But I've been [C]thinking about leaving [G7]long enough to change my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Some[F]times I miss the warm bright lights some[C]times I miss the noise
Some[F]times I miss the fading sounds of [C]every cheering [G7]voice
Some[F]times I miss that world out there so [C]empty hard and un[F]kind
But I've been [C]thinking about leaving [G7]long enough to change my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
And I've been thinking about leaving [G7]long enough to change my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}
