{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]It all began the [C]day my conscience [G]died
I reached for her and [A7]she pushed me [D7]aside
And [G]where a thing like this will ever [C]end God only [G]knows
When a man feels [C]more at [G]home [D7]away from [G]home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
At home I lied just to [D7]pacify her [C]cry and make [G]excuses
And wonder why she'd [C]even miss the [G]love she never [D7]uses
Here [G]in my home away from home I [C]hide from my de[G]ceit
And the one time that [D7]I'm an [G]honest [C]man is 
[G]When I come [D7]here to [G]cheat
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
By right I guess [C]I've been doing everything [G]wrong
And it may not be the [A7]proper thing to [D7]do
But [G]I can't find this kind of peace of [C]mind 
When I'm [G]around her
I'm more at [C]home [G]away from [D7]home with [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
At home I lied just to [D7]pacify her [C]cry and make [G]excuses
And wonder why she'd [C]even miss the [G]love she never [D7]uses
Here [G]in my home away from home I [C]hide from my de[G]ceit
And the one time that [D7]I'm an [G]honest [C]man is 
[G]When I come [D7]here to [G]cheat
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
And the one time that [D7]I'm an [G]honest [C]man is 
[G]When I come [D7]here to [G]cheat
{end_of_verse}
