{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]They said in her younger [Am]days 
Her [C]beauty was enough to drive men [F]wild 
But the [G7]hunger in her body [F]then 
Was [G7]not the hunger of some lonely [C]child
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Like a butterfly in spring[Am]time 
Searching [C]every field for lovin's sweetest [F]rose
The em[G7]brace of many stran[F]gers 
Still [G7]could not release her from the [C]hold
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
In the back streets and the bed[Am]rooms 
All [C]she's found is disappointments bitter [F]weeds
While the [G7]love that she's too often [F]found 
Is not [G7]enough to satisfy her [C]needs
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
She's older than the years she [Am]holds 
And [C]aging fast with each day passing [F]by
On a [G7]downhill run to no[F]where 
Cause the [G7]hunger never can be satis[C]fied
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
The [F]reflection in her [Em]mirror's 
Not the [F]image she [Em]remembers in her [C]mind
Her [F]beauty has been [Em]eaten by the [D7]hunger 
And the acid winds of [G7]time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
She has [C]danced the tune the [Am]demons play 
And [C]paid the piper dearly for his [F]song
Empty [G7]now of all the [F]pride 
Still in[G7]side the hunger's just as [C]strong
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Like a butterfly in spring[Am]time 
Searching [C]every field for lovin's sweetest [F]rose
The em[G7]brace of many stran[F]gers 
Still [G7]could not release her from the [C]hold
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
In the back streets and the bed[Am]rooms 
All [C]she's found is disappointments bitter [F]weeds
While the [G7]love that she's too often [F]found 
Is not [G7]enough to satisfy her [C]needs
