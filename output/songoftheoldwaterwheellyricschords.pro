{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]By the valley road the lilacs are [C]growin'
[D7]Around the mill with an old water [G]wheel
[C]In his dusty coat the river sits dreamin'
[D7]Of his true love the pretty [G]Lucille
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[D7]The old water wheel keeps turning and [A7]turning
[D7]It seems to speak of the kisses it sees
[G]Of the soft summer nights when the hearts were alive
[A7]Making love to the sound of the old water [D7]wheel

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[D7]In her eyes [G]of blue to heaven lay [C]dreaming
[D7]And her hair was brown as the meadow lark's [G]wings
[C]Every smile revealed white pearls empty dreamin'
[D7]And nature made her lips just to [G]sing
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
[D7]But fate was unkind she sleeps neath the [A7]lilacs
[D7]The busy world keeps moving along
[G]But the old river seems to be lost in his dreams
[A7]While the water wheel turns gently singin' their [D7]song
[A7]Lost in the song of the old water [D7]wheel
[A7]The old water [D7]wheel the [A7]old water [D7]wheel
{end_of_verse}
