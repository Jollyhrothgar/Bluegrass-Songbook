I've Thought Of Leaving You
Recorded Kitty Wells
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]I can see what's on your mind 
I can tell you every time you thought of [G7]leavin'
Thought that I'd just wait and see  
How long you'd keep deceivin' me with all[C] your cheatin'
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Lots of times you'd almost slip 
But oh how quick those lyin' lips would cover [G7]up for you
All you had to do was say 
I'd like to pack and get away I thought of [C]leaving too
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[F]You don't have to tell me things I already knew
[C]Every time your lips would lie your eyes would tell on you
[F]Never even give our love a good chance to win
Till you were [D7]out and lookin' [G7]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Before you [C]go I'll tell you true 
I used to follow her and knew your secret [G7]places
I wasn't too blind then to see 
You wanted her instead of me your happy [C]faces
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Guess it's over this is it 
Might as well just call it quits you're free to [G7]go now
Hope she doesn't think 
That she can hold you better than me you'll never [C]slow down
{end_of_verse}
