{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]The children are sleeping [G7]our talk can begin 
We've waited until they've gone to [C]bed
We knew they would cry [F]when we said [Dm]goodbye 
And [G7]I'd rather leave quietly [C]instead
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
We can never be happy [G7]we both know it's true
We've quarreled from the day that we [C]met
Our love was too weak to [F]pull our dreams [Dm]through 
But [G7]too strong to let us [C]forget
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I [F]hope we can salvage a [C]few memories 
To [D7]carry us through the long [G7]nights
The [F]clock's striking midnight [C]yesterday's gone 
And [G7]there's no tomorrow in [C]sight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
In our efforts to break through [G7]the thick walls of pride
With harsh words that burned to the [C]core
The walls still remain [F]but the words broke [Dm]inside 
And [G7]strengthened the walls even [C]more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I [F]hope we can salvage a [C]few memories 
To [D7]carry us through the long [G7]nights
The [F]clock's striking midnight [C]yesterday's gone 
And [G7]there's no tomorrow in [C]sight
