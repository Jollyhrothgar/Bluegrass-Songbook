I didn't feel so cold and tired stretched out before her fire
Rolling smokes and drinking up her [G7]wine

Well now that my song is sweeter I think I'd like to greet her
And thank her for the favors that she [G7]gave

I [Dm]sat and sang my [G7]songs on Susan's [C]floor

In the [F]morning I'd go [G7]on 
Buying [F]kingdoms with my [C]songs knowing I'd be back in just a [G7]while

Reliving all the wonder of those [G7]nights

And [Dm]sang another [G7]song on Susan's [C]floor
