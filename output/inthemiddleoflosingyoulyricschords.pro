[G]You no longer turn to me when [C]you need turnin' on
[D7]You've got a lotta love to give but [C]you don't give at [G]home
You don't touch me with your eyes the [C]way you used to do
I could [D7]be half blind and see 
That I'm in the [C]middle of a losing [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
And I'm just one step ahead of a [C]heartache
[D7]One jump in front of the [G]blues
And I'm way behind on your [C]sweet love
And I'm [D7]right in the middle of losing [G]you
{end_of_chorus}

And I'm just one step ahead of a [C]heartache

{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Every time I pull you close [C]you just pull away
[D7]Holding on to someone who's gone gets [C]harder every[G]day
You say everything's all right I [C]know that that's not true
Deep [D7]inside I know that I'm in the [C]middle of a losing [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
And I'm just one step ahead of a [C]heartache
[D7]One jump in front of the [G]blues
And I'm way behind on your [C]sweet love
And I'm [D7]right in the middle of losing [G]you
