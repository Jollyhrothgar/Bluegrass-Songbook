{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]You don't smoke and you don't swear 
You wouldn't [G7]do wrong on a dare 
And a good girl just can't chase away my [C]blues 
But I'm out fighting loneliness 
Dating [G7]girls I know will kiss 
But if I ever need a lady I'll call [C]you 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You drink [F]cokes and I drink wine
You [C]don't stay out after nine 
And [G7]that's when I'm getting up to lace my [C]shoes 
So don't [F]cry when you see painted [C]women out with me 
Cause if [G7]I ever need a lady I'll call [C]you 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Check inside your sweet heart 
Looks as [G7]pure where mine is dark 
And an angel is the one thing I just [C]can't use 
I need girls of the night all [G7]aglow with neon lights 
But if I ever need a lady I'll call [C]you
