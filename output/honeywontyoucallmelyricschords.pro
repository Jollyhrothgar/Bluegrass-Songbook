[G]I can see the home fire burning and the [C]kids playing [D7]in the [G]yard
As the [G]red sun is slowly fading on this [A7]rock and roll cowboys [D7]farm
Now I [C]wish had my [D7]woman to [Bm]kiss and love and hold me [C]tight 
But the [Am]only thing in [D7]my arms is [C]my gui[D7]tar to[G]night
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Now Honey won’t you [C]call [G]me
It [C]gets so lonely on the [G]road 
If I heard your [C]sweet [Bm]voice oh [F]darlin’ 
I’d [D7]turn around and come back [G]home

Well I dreamed that I had you with me I [C]smelled the perfume [D7]in your [G]hair
You were laying so warm beside me telling [A7]me how much you [D7]care
But I [C]woke up without you [D7]darlin’ to [Bm]tell me everything’s [C]alright 
But the [Am]only thing in [D7]my arms is [C]my gui[D7]tar to[G]night
