{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]It's the same old street in the same old town
The [F]same old places where we hung around
The [C]same old corner that I [F]once lingered [C]on
The whole world seems different to [G7]me since you're [C]gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
It's the same old crowd that we used to know
The [F]same old Mary and the same old Joe
The [C]same old places where we [F]danced until [C]dawn
The whole world seems different to [G7]me since you're [C]gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]Lonesome old house by the railroad track
Make's [C]me stop and wonder [D7]why I ever came [G7]back
The [C]house is so dark and filled with gloom
Your [F]faded old picture still hangs in my room
[C]Memories haunt me [F]they go on and [C]on
The whole world seems different to [G7]me since you're [C]gone
{end_of_verse}
