{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]As night time falls these old four walls become a [G7]prison
Where I’m condemned to live on love maned [C]alone
Oh I broke the only [C7]heart that ever [F]loved me
[C]Yes I built my own [G7]prison stone by [C]stone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
What a [G7]fool (what a fool) what a [C]fool (what a fool)
Looked in her eyes and told her lies and she [G7]believed me
She trusted me to be just hers and hers [C]alone
I never thought that she’d find [C7]out the truth and [F]leave me
And I [C]built my own [G7]prison stone by [C]stone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
What a [G7]fool (what a fool) what a [C]fool (what a fool)
I didn’t know I loved her so until I [G7]lost her
I never thought that I would reap the seeds I’d [C]sown
And now I’m sitting by [C7]myself and live [F]forever 
[C]In a prison that I [G7]built stone by [C]stone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
What a [G7]fool (what a fool) what a [C]fool (what a fool)
What a [G7]fool (what a fool) what a [C]fool (what a fool)
{end_of_verse}
