{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I've just been to heaven with [C]someone so [G]true
[D7]I dreamed about mama last [G]night
[C]She read me the Bible like she used to [G]do
[D7]I dreamed about mama last [G]night
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
She never closed her eyes and sleep till we were all in bed
[C]And on party nights [G]till we came home she often sat and [D7]read
[G]We little thought about it then for we were young and gay
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Just how much mama worried when we children were away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]We only knew she never slept then when we were out at [G]night
[D7]That she waited just to know that we'd all come home all [G]right
[C]Why sometimes when we'd stay away till one or two or three
[G]It seemed to us that mama heard the turnin' of the key
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[A7]For always when we'd step aside she'd call and we'd [D7]reply
[G]But we were all too young back then to understand the reason why
[C]Until the last one had returned she'd always keep a [G]light
[D7]For mama couldn't sleep until she kissed us all [G]goodnight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
She had to know that we were safe before she went to rest
[C]For she seemed to fear the world might harm the ones she loved the [G]best
[D7]And once she said when you're grown to women and to [G]men
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Perhaps I'll sleep the whole night through I may be different then
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
[C]And so it seemed that night and day we knew a mother's [G]care
[D7]That always when we got back home we'd find her waitin' [G]there
[C]Then came the night that we were called together round her bed
[G]The children are all with you now the kindly doctor said
[A7]And in her eyes there gleamed again that old time tender light
[D7]That told that she's just been waitin' to know that we were all [G]right
[C]She smiled that old familiar smile and prayed to God to [G]keep
[D7]Her children safe from harm throughout the years
[G]And then she went to sleep
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 9}
[C]My dream is a treasure that I'll always [G]keep
[D7]I dreamed about mama last [G]night
{end_of_verse}
