[C]When I was but a young man I was wild and full of [Am]fire

I [F]know it grieved them so [G7]to think there only boy was [Am]bad

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]I fell in with an outlaw bunch there names were known quite [Am]well
[C]How many times we robbed and plundered I could never [Am]tell
[C]This kind of sinful living leads only to a [Am]fall
I [F]learned that much and more the [G7]night I heard my Master [Am]call
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
One [F]night we rustled [C]cattle a [F]thousand head or [C]so
And [F]started them out on the [C]trail that leads to [Am]Mexico
When a norther started [G7]blowing and [C]lightning flashed [F]about
I [C]thought someone was [F]calling me I [G7]thought I heard a [C]shout
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
And at that moment lightning struck not twenty yards from [Em]me
And [F]left there was a giant cross where once there'd been a [C]tree
This time [Am]I know I heard a voice a voice so sweet and [Dm]strange
A [Em]voice that came from everywhere a voice that called my [Am]name

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[C]So frightened I was thinking of sinful deeds I'd [Am]done

My [F]pony ran but stumbled [G7]and he threw me to the [Am]ground
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
I [F]felt the end was [C]nearing that [F]death would be the [C]price
When a [F]mighty bolt of lightning [C]showed the face of Jesus [Am]Christ
And I cried oh Lord [G7]forgive me [C]don't let it happen [F]now
I [C]want to live for [F]you alone oh [G7]God these words I [C]vow
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
My wicked past unfolded and I thought of wasted [Em]years
When [F]another bolt of lightning killed a hundred head of [C]steers
And the [Am]others rushed on by me but I was left to [Dm]live
The [Em]master had a reason life is His to take or [Am]give
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
[C]A miracle performed that night I wasn't meant to [Am]die
[C]The dead ones formed a barricade least six or seven [Am]high
[C]And right behind it there was I afraid but safe and [Am]sound
I [F]cried and begged for mercy [G7]then and there upon the [Am]ground
{end_of_verse}

[C]A pardon I was granted my sinful soul set [Am]free
[C]No more to fear the angry waves upon life’s stormy [Am]seas

I [F]gave my life and soul the [G7]night the Savior called my [Am]name
{end_of_verse}
