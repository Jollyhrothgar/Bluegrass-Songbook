{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I'm going to Mon[F]tana to spend the [C]winter
I hear the snows are deep up there and the [F]winds are cold
Way out there the blues will never [C]find me
Oh I'm [F]going to Mon[Dm]tana to rest my [G7]soul
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [F]wish that special [G7]someone was [C]going along
But [F]she don't love me [G7]anymore so [C]I'll be gone
Maybe [F]I can find some[G7]one who cares 
Bout the [C]man I am stead of [Am]clothes I wear
Cause [F]I ain't taking nothing but my [G7]boots 
And jeans and a [F]big ole coat [G7]along
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]But o-h Lord [G7]wouldn't her warm [C]skin feel good at night
[F]Making love in a [G7]sleeping bag and [C]holding each other tight
We'd [F]spend the days [G7]side by side [C]riding upon the [Am]great divide
And [F]look across [G7]America and [F]feel so free [G7]inside
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[F]Oh Lord that would [G7]be quite a change for a [C]country boy like me
[F]Out there in the [G7]snow drifts [C]right up to my knees
And as I [F]warm my hands [G7]by the fire I'd [C]have to fight off a [Am]great desire
To [F]call that girl and [G7]ask her to come [F]out here for a [G7]while
{end_of_verse}

[C]I'm going to Mon[F]tana to spend the [C]winter

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I [F]wish that special [G7]someone was [C]going along
But [F]she don't love me [G7]anymore so [C]I'll be gone
Maybe [F]I can find some[G7]one who cares 
A [C]sweet simple girl who'd [Am]like to share
This [F]love I've held in[G7]side me for so [F]long 
[Dm]And help me sing my Montana [C]song ooh
