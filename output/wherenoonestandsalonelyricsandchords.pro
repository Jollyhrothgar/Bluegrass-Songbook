{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Once I stood in the [G7]night with my [C]head [F]bowed [C]low
In the d[G7]arkness as black as could be
And my [C]heart felt [G7]alone and I [C]cried oh [F]Lord
Don't [C]hide your [G7]face from [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Like a king I may [G7]live in a [C]palace [F]so [C]tall
With great riches to call my [G7]own
But I [C]don't know a [G7]thing in this [C]whole wide [F]world
That's [C]worse than [G7]being a[C]lone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Hold my hand all the [F]way every [G7]hour every [C]day
From [G7]here to the great un[C]known [C7]
[F]Take my [C]hand [G7]let me [F]stand where [C]no one [G7]stands a[C]lone
[F]Take my [C]hand [G7]let me [F]stand where [C]no one [G7]stands a[C]lone
{end_of_verse}
