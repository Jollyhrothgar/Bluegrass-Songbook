{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I've dodged the flame of love 
My heart's been slippery and cold
I always thought I'd walk this path 
[F]Least until I was [C]almost [G]old
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Those sweet lips and eyes of green 
Cut me like a blade of steel
Pull my heart like an eighteen wheel 
[F]Running up a [C]Tennessee [G]hill
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]I was a [G]rollin' stone 
My [F]feet never [C]touch the [G]ground
[C]She was the [G]only one 
That [F]ever could [C]tie me [G]down
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Feel like I left behind 
Trapped to an angel's wings
Bounded to a new born love 
[F]Tied up in the [C]apron [G]strings
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I used to live alone 
Never needed anyone
And she turned my head around 
I [F]didn't even [C]try to [G]run
{end_of_verse}

{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Lookin' back I realize happy is not what I was
When you run across a woman
It's your true love 
That [F]stronger than a [C]moonshine [G]buzz
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]I was a [G]rollin' stone 
My [F]feet never [C]touch the [G]ground

That [F]ever could [C]tie me [G]down
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Yeah [C]I was a [G]rollin' stone 
My [F]feet never [C]touch the [G]ground
