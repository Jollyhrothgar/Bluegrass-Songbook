{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]One has my name  the other has my [G7]heart
With one I'll remain  that's when my heartaches [C]start
One has brown eyes  the [C7]other's eyes are [F]blue
To [D7]one I am tied  but to the [G7]other I am true
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]One has my love  the other has only [G7]me
But what good is love to a heart that can't be [C]free
So I'll go living [C7]my life just the [F]same
While [C]one has my heart and the [G7]other has my [C]name
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
One has my love  the other only [G7]me
But what good is love to a heart that can't be [C]free
If I could live over my life [C7]I would [F]change
The [C]one who has my heart would [G7]also have my [C]name
{end_of_verse}
