{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I was once a broken man I [C]was once a broken [G]fool
Lost my wife and children to one basic broken [D7]rule
[G]Now I live my life in silence though I'm not [C]quite in a [G]shell
I drink and listen to that song a [C]whiter shade of [G]pale
Oh a [C]whiter shade of [G]pale
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I was a good shade tree mechanic so I sent [C]myself to [G]school
They smoothed out my rough edges in my hands they put new [D7]tools
The [G]instructor once he told me I [C]could work on any [G]line
I could tune and make a diesel sing just [C]like Patsy [G]Cline
Oh [C]just like Patsy [G]Cline
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well I met my wife to be [C]through my mother's best friend [G]son
She'd been a barroom singer she was as good as [D7]anyone
But I [G]asked her to stop singing and the girl [C]she did not [G]flinch
Next day she went and bought that man a brand [C]new crescent [G]wrench
Oh a [C]brand new crescent [G]wrench
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Well we had three fine children as [C]eight years went on [G]by
I learned to supervise a line my knuckles stayed bone [D7]dry
But after [G]supper I kept hearing her by the [C]kitchen [G]radio
Singing sweet but desperate harmony a [C]little bit too [G]low
Oh a [C]little bit too [G]low
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
She left three months later I'd [C]just come home for [G]lunch
The note said easy come hard go but [C]still love you so [G]much
She said I don't know if I'll be back or if you'll [C]want me if I [G]come
But if and when that happens dear you better [C]let my sweet dream [G]run
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Oh [C]let my sweet dream [G]run
{end_of_verse}
