{meta: artist Hank Williams}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[Am]I can settle down and be doing just fine
Till I [E7]hear an old train rolling down the [Am]line
Then I hurry straight home and pack
And if I [E7]didn't go I believe I'd blow my [Am]stack
I love you baby but you gotta understand
When the [E7]Lord made me He made a rambling [Am]man
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Some folks might say that I'm no good
That [E7]I wouldn't settle down if I [Am]could
But when that open road starts to calling me
There's something [E7]over the hill that I gotta [Am]see
Sometimes it's hard but you gotta understand
When the [E7]Lord made me He made a rambling [Am]man
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I love to see the towns a passing by
And to [E7]ride these rails 'neath God's blue [Am]sky
Let me travel this land from the mountains to the sea
Cause that's the [E7]life I believe He meant for [Am]me
And when I'm gone and at my grave you stand
Just say [E7]God called home your rambling [Am]man
{end_of_verse}
