{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]She was standing at the front door 
When [F]I came home last [C]night
A good book in her left hand 
And a [G7]rollin' pin in the right
She said [C]you've come home for the last time 
With [F]whiskey on your [C]breath
If you don't listen to my preaching boy 
I'm gonna [G7]have to beat you half to [C]death
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Give me just a one more last chance 
[F]Before you say we're [C]through
I know I drive you crazy baby 
It's the [G7]best that I can do
We're just some [C]good ol' boys a making noise 
I ain't [F]running round on [C]you
Give me just a [F]one more [C]last chance 
[G7]Before you say we're [C]through
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
At first she hid my glasses 
Because she [F]knows that I can't [C]see
She said you ain't going nowhere boy 
Until you [G7]spend a little time with me
Then the [C]boys called from the honky tonk 
Said there's a [F]party going on down [C]here
Well she might've took my car keys 
But she [G7]forgot about my old John [C]Deere
