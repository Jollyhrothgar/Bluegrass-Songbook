[G]From the very first hello until the [C]very last goodbye
[D7]From here to there and everything [G]between [D7]
All [G]I ever did was try my best to [C]keep you satisfied
And all [D7]you ever did was make a fool of [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I tried [D7]every way I knew to give you [G]everything I had
And all [A7]I ever did was try to treat you [D7]right
Still the [G]best that I could do was never [C]good enough for you
I couldn't [D7]please you but the good Lord knows I [G]tried
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
My old friends they tried to warn me but I [C]paid them all no mind
When [D7]I see them now we don't have much to [G]say [D7]
For [G]you took everything I had and left me [C]nothing but behind
Feeling [D7]like some old forgotten yester[G]day
