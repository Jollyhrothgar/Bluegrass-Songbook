[G7]Is the magic still [C]there  whenever I hold [Dm]you
Do these lips of mine send chills down [G7]your spine 
Like they [F]u-sed [G7]to
Or is it slipping away  baby come out and [C]say
I'm [F]asking because I [Dm]care
I just need to [G7]know is the magic still [Dm][C]there

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh I still [C]recall our first time [Dm]together
Oh we kissed and we [G7]touched
We couldn't get enough of each [G7][C]other
And when we said goodnight beneath that old porch [C]light
It left us wanting [F]more
But I'm wondering now if time has [G7]somehow
[F]Changed what we felt [C]before

So baby I'm asking only because I [F]care
