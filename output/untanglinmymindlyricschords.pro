{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I guess you're glad to [G7]see I'm finally [C]leaving
I know [Am]things for you will [Em]change now for the [Dm]good[G7]
But it's [F]all that I can do to pack my [C]suitcase
[D7]And walk away from you the way I [G7]should
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]And I can't seem to [G7]find the voice of [C]reason
Every[Am]thing seems upside [Em]down and right side [Dm]wrong[G7]
While a [F]part of me is here and won't like [C]leaving
The rest of me the [G7]best of me is [C]gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I'm [F]sure no one will [A]wonder [F]where I've [C]gone to
But if [F]anyone should [D]ask from [A]time to time
[F]Tell them that you [A]finally [F]drove me [C]crazy
And I'm somewhere [G7]untanglin' my [C]mind [G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Well [C]tell 'em I won't be [G7]ridin' I'll be [C]walking
[Am]Cause I don't think [Em]a crazy man should [Dm]drive[G7]
[F]Anyway the car belongs to [C]you now
Along [D7]with any part of me that's still [G7]alive
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
But there's [C]really not much [G7]left you could hold [C]on to
And if you [Am]did it wouldn't [Em]last here any[Dm]way[G7]
It would [F]head to where the rest of me rolled [C]on to
So even if I wanted to [G7]I couldn't [C]stay
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
[F]I'm sure no one w[A]ill won[F]der where I[C]'ve gone to
But if [F]anyone should [D]ask from [A]time to time
[F]Tell them that you [A]finally [F]drove me [C]crazy
And I'm somewhere [G7]untanglin' my [C]mind [Am]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
I'm [Dm]somewhere [G7]untanglin' my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}
