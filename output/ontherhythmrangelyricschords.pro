{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I was born a rover on the rhythmic [G7]range
A [C]rootin' tootin' terror and I never will [G]change
I sing a [D7]tune to the day travel all of the way in [G]rhythm[D7]
[G]Everything around me is a part of my [G7]song
They [C]seem to want to follow as I ramble [G]along
The lazy [D7]hawk in the sky is even tempted to try my [G]rhythm[G7]

On the rhythm [C]range (on the rhythm range)

Every[D7]thing is keepin' time
To a sort of runic rhyme and [G]rhythm

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Every time a Sunday comes a rolling [G7]around
[C]Down beside the water hole I'm sure to be [G]found
I'll be [D7]scrubbin' and rubbin' in a manner profound in [G]rhythm[D7]
[G]Water from a thousand feet is colder than [G7]air
I [C]always thought the devil kept it warmer down [G]there
I guess it [D7]weren't to his path so I'll be takin' my bath in [G]rhythm[G7]

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I asked the prairie chicken when he started to [G7]scratch
If [C]sandy fleas and bumble bees could hatch a better [G]hatch
He said the [D7]only thing found beneath this doggone ground is [G]rhythm[D7]
He [G]started into workin' with a pause of his [G7]head
And [C]then he turned around to me and here's what he [G]said
I ain't a [D7]diggin' for gold but when I'm scratchin' my soul’s got [G]rhythm[G7]
