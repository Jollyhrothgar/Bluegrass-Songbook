{meta: artist Hank Williams}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I tried so hard my dear to show that you're my every [G7]dream
Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil [C]scheme
A memory from your lonesome past keeps [C7]us so far [F]apart
Why [G7]can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your Cold Cold [C]Heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Another love before my time made your heart sad and [G7]blue
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't [C]do
In anger unkind words are said that [C7]make the teardrops [F]start 
Why [G7]can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your Cold Cold [C]Heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
You'll never know how much it hurts to see you sit and [G7]cry
You know you need and want my love yet you're afraid to [C]try
Why do you run and hide from life to [C7]try it just ain't [F]smart
Why [G7]can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your Cold Cold [C]Heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
There was a time when I believed that you belonged to [G7]me
But now I know your heart is shackled to a me[C]mory
The more I learn to care for you the [C7]more we drift a[F]part
Why [G7]can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your Cold Cold [C]Heart
{end_of_verse}
