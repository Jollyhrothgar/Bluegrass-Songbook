{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Oh Christmas candle please light up the way
[D7]Back to my memories of yester[G]day
Icicles hanging on evergreen trees
[D7]Buttery snowflakes that fell on my [G]cheeks
[C]Momma's sweet singing and [G]daddy's big hands
And Christmas [D7]all over the [G]land
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh Christmas candle please light up the way
[D7]To when I would ride on a small wooden [G]sleigh
Riding on snow just as pure as the heart
[D7]Of sweet baby Jesus in His mother's [G]arms
[C]Starlight that glistened on [G]snow covered hills
When Christmas [D7]was holy and [G]still
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Oh Christmas candle please light up the way
[D7]Into the past and the innocent [G]days
When we were just children with hearts full of trust
[D7]And we thought that Christmas was all about [G]us
[C]There by the fireside with [G]sweet smelling wood
We made a promise [D7]that we would be [G]good
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Oh Christmas candle please light up the way
[D7]I want to go back there for one Christmas [G]day
Be with my loved ones and breathe in the air
[D7]I light this candle and send up this [G]prayer
[C]Starlight that glistened on [G]snow covered hills
When Christmas [D7]was holy and [G]still
{end_of_verse}
