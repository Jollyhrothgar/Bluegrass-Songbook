{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]From where I stand I can see all the lights in the [D7]city
[G]For one man to love one woman so much it's a pity
[D7]From where I stand I can see the cantina she goes to
[A7]Where she's not supposed to but goes [D7]anyway
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G]From where I stand I can hear the music and [D7]laughter
[G]Camelia keeps telling me that's all her young heart is after
[G7]I see it differently I see her there with a [C]man
[D7]Camelia keeps lying I see from where I [G]stand
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[D7]If there was one ounce of man left in me I'd accuse her
[G]What's left of a man knows for certain if I do I'll lose her
[D7]It wouldn't do to let her know I know she's lying
[A7]Or that I've been spying she'd never come [D7]back
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[G]Camelia I almost despise the ground that you walk [D7]on
[G]The reason I don't is it's me not the ground that you walk on
[G7]Constantly tormented knowing you're just partly [C]mine
[D7]Camelia I hate you and love you at the same [G][C][G]t-i-m-e
{end_of_verse}
