{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I have the world to offer you
Yes you have the world to hold
[D7]Till the day when God declares
[G]Time on earth shall be no more
Fire and brimstone shall rain down
And melt it like was snow
What will you have to offer then
[D7]To a dying [G]soul
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But think of all you're giving up
I'm giving up the chance to die
And [D7]spend eternity in hell
[G]Burning in a lake of fire
I think God has made a way
That I might escape
By the living grace of God
[D7]I shall see His [G]face
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
You don't sin you're good enough
There's not a just man upon earth
That [D7]doeth good and sinneth not
All [G]we like sheep have gone astray
We have turned everyone to his own way
And the Lord hath laid on him
The [D7]iniquity of us [G]all
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
But life will be too dull for you
Everything you offer me
[D7]Don't mean nothing to my heart
[G]For from sin I've been set free
Praise the Lord I'm going home
Ever to rejoice take the world and get behind
I have found a peace of mind everlasting joy is mine
[D7]Jesus is my [G]all
{end_of_verse}
