{meta: artist Hank Thompson}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I never thought you’d be [G7]sorry
That you told me goodbye that [C]day
I [C7]thought that after you left [F]me
With [D7]another you’d go far [G7]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]I didn’t think that you’d miss [G7]me
But heartaches you say you’ve been [C]through
If [C7]I’d only thought that you’d want [F]me
I’d have [G7]never found somebody [C]new
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I guess it’s too late to turn back [G7]now
To recapture our sweet used to [C]be
The [C7]one that I have has been [F]faithful
I’ll [D7]not hurt her like you hurt [G7]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]I’d give anything to start [G7]over
There’ll never be no one like [C]you
If [C7]I’d only thought that you’d want [F]me
I’d have [G7]never found somebody [C]new
{end_of_verse}
