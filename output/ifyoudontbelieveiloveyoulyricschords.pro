{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I’d crawl a million miles on my knees through flames
To be somewhere someone spoke [F]your name
I’d even [C]marry your cat just to get in your [G7]family
I’d turn inside out if you wanted [C]me to
Even be the town crier and I’d really [F]sound blue 
And if you [C]don’t believe I love [G7]you just ask [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I’d walk to the ends of the earth [F]every night
[C]Just to see you got safely home
[F]Call you long distance around the world on [D7]a pay [G7]telephone
So if there’s doubt in your mind that my love’s still [C]true
I’d save the broken pieces of my heart [F]for you
And if you [C]still don’t believe I love [G7]you just ask [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well I’d drive through the rain sleet and the snow
With no defrosters and my heater [F]on low
Take a [C]dog sled across Alaska to be by your [G7]side
I’d count all of the stars in the [C]heavens above
Even lay down and die just to prove [F]my love
And if you [C]still don’t believe I love [G7]you just ask [C]me
