[C]Through your heart there runs a highway
[F]Where loves traffic comes and [D7]goes

[F]I keep searching for the stop sign I know I'll never [D7]find
[G7]Cause I'm just another love passing [C]through

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]How I'd like to linger  how I'd love to [C]stay
[F]But it says no parking on [C]your heart's [G7]highway
[C]So I'll just keep a-traveling down [F]this highway paved with [D7]blues
[G7]Cause I'm just another love passing [C]through
