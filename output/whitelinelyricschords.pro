{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Seems like I was [F]there from the [G7]start 
A witness to your wild and reckless [C]heart
You showed me the [F]way but now you're [G7]gone
Quicker than the trigger of an outlaw's gun living fast and dying young
A victim of this road you left me [C]on
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
[F]White [C]line [G7]took my [C]baby
[F]Led him [C]down that [G7]dark high[C]way
[F]Headlight [C]blind [G7]driving [C]crazy
[F]If my [C]wheels keep [G7]turnin' gonna roll that white line [C]away

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
We worked the road as [F]hard as we could [G7]drive her
But now I am the only [C]survivor
From night to night at [F]every place I [G7]play in
The sweetness of your song remains I'll be the keeper of the flame
Till every soul hears what your heart was [C]saying

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
All the [Am]nights you spent [F]alone 
All the [C]love I'd never [G7]shown
All the [Am]words I could not [F]say
Till that [C]white line took you [G7]away [F]white [C]line [G7]took you [C]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I'll follow the white [F]line down where it's [G7]winding
Cause somewhere up ahead your light's still [C]shining
The sound of the silver strings will [G7]guide me
I've stood and watched the bridges burn I'm past the point of no return
Oh how I wish that you were here [C]beside me
