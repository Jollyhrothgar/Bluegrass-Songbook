{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Here in this room this narrow room where life began 
When we were [C]young last [G]night
I feel your back [D7]pressed close to me 
And [C]hear your steady breathing as [D7]you [G]sleep
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Then as the first soft glow of dawn
Moves silver grey like paint [C]along the [G]wall
I touch your hand [D7]and feel your ring 
And [C]know this night is [D7]all we'll ever [G]have
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Suddenly I look into your sleepy [D7]eyes
You breathe my name and it just seems to [C]dangle [G]there
Then I feel your fingers running through my [D7]mind
Jumbling up my thoughts to leave them [C]tangled [G]there
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus: Repeat 1}
Suddenly I look into your sleepy [D7]eyes
You breathe my name and it just seems to [C]dangle [G]there
Then I feel your fingers running through my [D7]mind
Jumbling up my thoughts to leave them [C]tangled [G]there
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus: Repeat 2}
Suddenly I look into your sleepy [D7]eyes
You breathe my name and it just seems to [C]dangle [G]there
Then I feel your fingers running through my [D7]mind
Jumbling up my thoughts to leave them [C]tangled [G]there
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I know so well that this is all there is
And when we leave this [C]room it's [G]gone
My mind is clear as [D7]we walk down 
The [C]crooked little steps to the [D7]front [G]door
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
A ray of sun that ricochets
From off the rooftop lights our [C]stumbling [G]way
I touch your hand [D7]and feel your ring 
And [C]know this night is [D7]all we'll ever [G]have
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Suddenly I look into your sleepy [D7]eyes
You breathe my name and it just seems to [C]dangle [G]there
Then I feel your fingers running through my [D7]mind
Jumbling up my thoughts to leave them [C]tangled [G]there
{end_of_chorus}
