{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Those [Am]stormy years leave [Em]deep and endless
[F]Trails across his [C]face
He'll wander back when [G7]morning rolls [C]around
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
For it's an [Am]old man's right to [Em]spend his life 
Just [F]searching for a [C]place
Where he can sit and [G7]watch the sun go [C]down
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Time's [Am]run its course and [Em]freed the horse 
That [F]pulled him through his [C]prime
And placed a different [G7]light above his [C]brow
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Now [Am]towering rows of [Em]buildings grow
In [F]fields he left be[C]hind
And life seems twice as [G7]heavy as a [C]plow
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
So [Am]crowd around the corner boys
And [C]take your good old time
And pass along a piece of yester[F]day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
A [Am]tender breeze of [Em]memories 
Is [F]blowing through your [C]mind
Softer than those [G7]strands of silver-[C]gray
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
The [Am]golden chain the old [Em]men clings
To the [F]watch inside their [C]vest
That tells them when it's [G7]time to move [C]along
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
Just [Am]rambling through the [Em]avenues 
They'll [F]sometimes stop to [C]rest
But it's hard to find a [G7]place where they [C]belong
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 9}
So [Am]crowd around the corner boys
And [C]take your good old time
And pass along a piece of yester[F]day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 10}
A [Am]tender breeze of [Em]memories 
Is [F]blowing through your [C]mind
Softer than those [G7]strands of silver-[C]gray
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 11}
And sweeter than the [G7]things we've seen [Am]today
{end_of_verse}
