{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]A friend of mine bought himself a shovel said I'm gonna tunnel me a [G7]mine
He set out to be a rich man happiness is what he thought he'd [C]find
Got in too deep to see the diamonds down too dark to see the [F]gold
Now he won't let go of the [C]shovel and he [G7]can't dig out of the [C]hole

[F]Deeper and [C]deeper [F]he's goin' [C]down
[F]Driving his [C]future [D7]right into the [G7]ground
He [F]thinks he's [C]closer the [F]further he [C]goes
But [F]he's st[C]ill on the bot[G7]tom and he can't dig [C]out of the hole
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I tried to throw the man a lifeline I tried to send him down a [G7]rope
I don't think he hears me calling but every day I pray and I [C]hope
Somehow he finally gets the message every spade of dirt he [F]throws
Only gets him close to the [C]devil and he [G7]can't dig out of the [C]hole

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Maybe we could learn a little lesson maybe this'll shine a little [G7]light
There's no healthy way to mess with the line between wrong and [C]right
Use the one chance you've been given cause once you're in the ground and [F]cold
It's too late to start [C]livin' you see you [G7]can't dig out of the [C]hole
