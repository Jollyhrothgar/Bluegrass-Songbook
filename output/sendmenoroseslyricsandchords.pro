[G]I would send her a [C]rose when I couldn't make it [G]home
I was always [C]away she was always [G]alone
But roses couldn't hold her [C]tight or keep her warm in the [G]night
And in time she slipped [C]away  I can [D7]still hear her [G]say
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Send me no roses send no roses [D7]today
Just like our dreams the fragrance will soon fade [G]away
The magic is gone our love has [G7]died on the [C]vine
Send me no [D7]roses  roses can't bring it back this [G]time
{end_of_verse}

Empty arms reaching [C]out left so [G]unsatisfied
Needing so much to [C]find love that she was [G]denied

I remember the [C]day  that I [D7]heard baby [G]say
{end_of_verse}
