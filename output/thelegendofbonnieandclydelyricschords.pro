[G]Bonnie was a waitress in a [D7]small [G]cafe

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The poems that she wrote of the life [D7]that they [G]led
Told of the lawmen left [D7]dying or [G]dead
Some say that Clyde made [C]her life a [G]shame
But the legend made Bonnie the [D7]head of the [G]game
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The rampage grew wilder with [D7]each passing [G]day
The odds growing smaller with [D7]each get a [G]way
With the end growing closer the [C]harder they [G]fought
With blood on their hands they were [D7]bound to get [G]caught
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
They drove back from town on one [D7]bright summer [G]day
When a man they befriended stepped [D7]out in the [G]way
With no thought of dying they [C]pulled to the [G]side
But death lay there waiting for [D7]Bonnie and [G]Clyde
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Two years or running was [D7]ended that [G]day
For robbing and killing they [D7]both had to [G]pay
But we'll always remember how [C]they lived and [G]died
So goes the Legend of [D7]Bonnie and [G]Clyde
{end_of_verse}
