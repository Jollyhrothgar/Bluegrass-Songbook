{meta: artist Conway Twitty}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I think that I just wrote my [D7]first country song
I've had this lonesome hurtin' feeling all night [G]long
I didn't know I love her [C]and now she's gone
[D7]I think that I just wrote my first country [G]song
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G7]I always like to hear those [C]country singers sing
And the [A7]way they play those guitars boy [D7]they sure do make 'em ring
[G]But when they sing the words I can [C]never sing along
[D7]I didn't believe things happen that way
I thought our love was here to stay
Till yesterday she walked away and now they're hittin' [G]home

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G7]I wrote some words about the [C]good times that we had
And [A7]then some lines about losing my mind or [D7]missing you so bad
[G]And I didn’t leave out a thing about the [C]way you done me wrong
[D7]I sang my song to the saddest note that anybody ever wrote
And I think that I just wrote my first country [G]song
