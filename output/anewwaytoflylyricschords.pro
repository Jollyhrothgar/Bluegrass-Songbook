{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Like birds on a high line they line up at night time at the [D7]bar
They all once were love birds now bluebirds are all that they [G]are
They landed in hell the minute they fell from love's [C]sky[G]   [Am]
And now they [G]hope in the wine that [D7]they'll find a new way to [G]fly
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
A [C]new way to [G]fly far away from good[Em]bye
Above the clouds and the [C]rain the memories 
And the [D7]pain and the tears that they [G]cry[D7]
Now the lesson's been [G]learned they've all crashed and [Em]burned
But they can leave it [C]behind if [A7]they could just [D7]find a new way to [G]fly
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
By the end of the night they'll be high as a kite once [D7]again
And they don't seem to mind all the time or the money they [G]spend
It's a high price to pay to just find a way to get [C]by [G]  [Am]
But it's [G]worth every dime if [D7]they find a new way to [G]fly
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
A [C]new way to [G]fly far away from good[Em]bye
Above the clouds and the [C]rain the memories 
And the [D7]pain and the tears that they [G]cry[D7]
Now the lesson's been [G]learned they've all crashed and [Em]burned
But they can leave it [C]behind if [A7]they could just [D7]find a new way to [G]fly
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
They'll leave it [C]behind as [A7]soon as they [D7]find a new way to [G]fly
{end_of_verse}
