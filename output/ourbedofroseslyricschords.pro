{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]The morning we moved in this house [C]you said let's make a bed [G]of [G][C]roses
[D7]So hand in hand we found that special place and I broke [G]the [D7]ground
[G]I wiped that delta dirt from [C]your face as you knelt there [G]to sow [G][C]them
[Am]Oh I'd give anything a mortal man [D7]could give if you could see them [G7][G]now
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]Through the kitchen windowpane I can see [G]the [G][C]roses
[D7]The ones we planted that first spring are blooming like they did when you [G]were [G7]here
[C]Someone's always left behind when the door of this life [Em][G]closes
[Am]So I sit alone and watch it [D7]rain on our bed [G]of [C]roses
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G]Some days I sit for hours at the [C]time just stirring at [G]those [G][C]roses
[D7]They seem so young and full of life but soon they'll face the winter [D7][G]chill
[G]I don't know how long I can [C]survive but one thing that [G]I know [G][C]is
[Am]Come spring time the roses [D7]will return but you [G]never [D7]will
