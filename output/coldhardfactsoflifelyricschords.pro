{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I got back in town a day [G7]before I'd planned [C]to
I [G7]smiled and said I'll sure surprise my [C]wife
[F]I don't think I'll call I'll just get on [C]home
For I didn't know the [G7]cold hard facts of [C]life
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I passed a little [G7]wine store on the [C]corner
I [G7]pictured pink champagne by candle [C]light
I [F]stopped the car right then got out and hurried [C]in
My mind not on the [G7]cold hard facts of [C]life
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
A [F]stranger stood there laughing at the [C]counter
He [G7]said I'll have two bottles of your [C]best
Her [F]husband's out of town and there's a [C]party
He winked as if to say you know the [G7]rest
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I [C]left the store two steps [G7]behind the [C]stranger
From [G7]there to my house his car stayed in [C]sight
It [F]wasn't till he turned into my drive that I [C]learned
I was witnessing the [G7]cold hard facts of [C]life
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I [F]drove around the block till I was [C]dizzy
Each [G7]time the noise came louder from [C]within
And [F]then I saw our bottle there beside [C]me
I drank a fifth of courage and walked [G7]in
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
[C]Lord you should have [G7]seen their frantic [C]faces
They [G7]screamed and cried please put away that [C]knife
I [F]think I'll go to hell or I'll rot here in this [C]cell
But who taught who the [G7]cold hard facts of [C]life
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
But who taught who the [G7]cold hard facts of [C]life
{end_of_verse}
