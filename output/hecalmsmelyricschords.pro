[G]Troubled waters came my way the [C]angry [G]storm grew near
I [D7]prayed for God to speak the words and [A7]make it dis[D7]appear
It [C]seems the waves would [G]not obey the [G7]Master's call for [C]peace
But then the Lord [G]spoke to my soul [C]reminded me He [G]had control  
And [C]said His time His [D7]works were meant for [G]me

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Sometimes He calms the storm [C]sometimes He calms [G]me
Sometimes the storm still rages on but [A7]I feel the sweetest [D7]peace
It's [G]such a joy to know that my Lord [C]knows just what I [G]need
Sometimes He calms the storm [C]sometimes [D7]He calms [G]me

Circumstance may overtake and [C]bring me [G]to my knees
But [D7]when I feel I cannot cope with [A7]this life's troubled [D7]seas
I call on [C]Him whose [G]voice can still much [G7]greater storms than [C]these
His words bring peace [G]into my soul [C]when He says child [G]I'm in control
And [C]with one touch He [D7]calms the storm in [G]me
