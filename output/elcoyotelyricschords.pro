From staring to long at the [C]sun

But he's true to his school and he's nobody's fool

That he was determined to [G7]climb
Then he caught the scent of a sister in spirit 
Who taught him to love her in [C]time

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Somehow or other she gathered together 
The cubs [C7]that he sired on the [F]way
And they run by his side through 
The [C]chill hungry night
And they [G7]sleep to his sweet [C]serenade

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
There's a [F]part of his heart up in [C]heaven 
And a [F]part that will always be [C]wild

To [G7]run for the rest of their lives 
lonesome coyote [C]survives
