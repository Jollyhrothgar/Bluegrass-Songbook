{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Isn't there anyone who'll take me like I am
Someone who's willin' to take a foolin' [C7]man
[F]Someone that's pleased enough with himself to let me be
[C]Someone who'll love me and try to understand my needs
[G7]No I guess there isn't and there's no place I can go
I guess I'm destined to be [C]alone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Good thing that somewhere in this world there'll be
Someone who wouldn't always try to change [C7]me
[F]Someone who might be trying to prove their way is right
[C]Take a flame that's burnin' and just put out the light
[G7]No I guess there isn't and there's no place I can go
I guess I'm destined to be [C]alone
{end_of_verse}
