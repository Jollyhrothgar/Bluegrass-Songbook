{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]In the quiet of the evening I sing a mournful [C]song
[G]As the night wind blows a low lonesome [D7]moan
[G]Oh she left without a warning my world came tumbling [C]down
[G]Our love ended with [D7]the sad heartbreaking [G]sound
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
[C]Now the blues are moving in I can't help the way I feel
[G]What an awful price for love I've had to [D7]pay

[G]What a cold world when [D7]the blues are moving [G]in

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]I heard her walk across the floor heard the closing of the door
[G]And the sound of silence cut me like a [D7]knife
