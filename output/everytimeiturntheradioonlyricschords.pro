{meta: title Every Time I Turn The Radio On}
{meta: artist Bill Anderson}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Every time I turn the radio on some [F]cat's singing a happy song
About a [C]woman who wakes him up every morning and loves [G7]him
[C]Scrambles his eggs and unscrambles his life 
[F]Butters his toast with a golden knife
Bears his [C]kids and nearly bout [G7]all of his [C]burdens
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And I just sit there staring at the wall [F]wondering how I missed it all
I've [C]been out half of the night and I'm hung [G7]over
[C]Nobody woke me rubbing my feet 
[F]Just the sound of a jackhammer out in the street
And this ole [C]room ain't exactly a [G7]field of [C]clover
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Am I the only tavern-hopping [F]beer-can-popping fool left in the [C]world
Am I the only sad-and-lonely [F]meek-weak-freak without a [C]girl
No one to love and make me happy [F]call me baby or call me pappy
[G7]Am I the only low-and-lonely woman-needing jukebox-feeding
Suffering son of a gun left in the [C]world
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Every time I turn the radio on some [F]cat's singing a happy song
About [C]the woman who serves him love on a silver [G7]platter
[C]Makes his coffee sweet and warm 
[F]Holds him in her loving arms
I look in the [C]mirror and I wonder [G7]what's the [C]matter
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Am I the only tavern-hopping [F]beer-can-popping fool left in the [C]world
Am I the only sad-and-lonely [F]meek-weak-freak without a [C]girl
No one to love and make me happy [F]call me baby or call me pappy
[G7]Am I the only low-and-lonely woman-needing jukebox-feeding
Suffering son of a gun left in the [C]world
