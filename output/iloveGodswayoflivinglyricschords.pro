{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I was on the sea of death drifting onward to distress
Didn't think I needed Jesus in my [D7]soul
I couldn't [G]bear to lose my pride thought that I was satisfied
Praise His holy name He [D7]found and saved my [G]soul
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh I love (oh yes I love) God's way of living
I'm so thankful I accepted when He [D7]called
He will [G]keep me out of jail He has saved my soul from hell
I love God's way of [D7]living best of [G]all (best of all)
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Many times I went in debt for the drink I could not quit
And old Satan urged me on to break the [D7]law
Tore my [G]little home apart broke my dad and mothers heart
Now I love God's way of [D7]living best of [G]all
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Oh I love (oh yes I love) God's way of living
I'm so thankful I accepted when He [D7]called
He will [G]keep me out of jail He has saved my soul from hell
I love God's way of [D7]living best of [G]all (best of all)
