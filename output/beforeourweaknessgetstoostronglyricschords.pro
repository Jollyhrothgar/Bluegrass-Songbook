[G]What are we doing [D7]in this place [G]alone
Is our desire to re[D7]live our past this [G]strong
The [C]love we knew in the past is gone [G]but our weakness lingers [C]on
Let's go [G]home before our [D7]weakness gets too [G]strong
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]Long ago we let the flame of love burn out of control
Now we have no reason to reach for love that has grown [D7]cold

Let's go [G]home before our [D7]weakness gets too [G]strong
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Lined with temptation we’ve [D7]raced into the [G]past
On a road too small to [D7]let the past and the present [G]pass
Are we [C]going too fast to turn back and [G]leave the past [C]alone
Let's go [G]home before our [D7]weakness gets too [G]strong
