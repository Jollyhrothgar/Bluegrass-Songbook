[G]You say I'm being selfish cause I won't set him [C]free
[D7]But once I've given him to you what is left for [G]me

[D7]But if you were losing him to me I wonder what you'd [G]do

[C]If you were losing everything that made your world go [G]round
[C]Would you hang on till he'd forgot the [G]other love he'd [D7]found
[G]Or would you really let him go the way you want me [C]to
[D7]If you were losing him to me I wonder what you'd [G]do
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]You've had your stolen moments but how can they compare
[D7]With the many ups and downs that we have had to [G]share

[D7]But if you were losing him to me I wonder what you'd [G]do
