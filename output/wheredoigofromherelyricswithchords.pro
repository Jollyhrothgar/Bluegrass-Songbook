{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]If I knew the way I'd go back [Am]home
The [D7]countryside has changed so much I'd [C]surely end up [G]lost
Half-remembered names and faces so [Am]far in the past
On the [D7]other side of the [C]bridges 
That were burned once they were [G]crossed
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Tell me [D7]where where does a fool go 
[G]When there's no one left to [C]listen
To a [D7]story without meaning that nobody wants to [G]hear
Tell me [D7]where where does a fool go 
When he [G]knows there's something [C]missing
Tell me [D7]where where will I go from [G]here 
[C]Where will I go from [G]here
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Get back [Am]home where my [D7]childhood dreams
And [C]wishes still are none of my [G]regrets
Go back to a place where I can [Am]figure all the odds
Have a [D7]fightin' chance to [C]lose the blues 
And win my share of [G]bets
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Tell me [D7]where where does a fool go 
[G]When there's no one left to [C]listen
To a [D7]story without meaning that nobody wants to [G]hear
Tell me [D7]where where does a fool go 
When he [G]knows there's something [C]missing
Tell me [D7]where where will I go from [G]here 
[C]Where will I go from [G]here
{end_of_verse}
