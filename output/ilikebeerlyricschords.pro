[C]In some of my songs I [F]have casually [C]mentioned

So [D7]roll out the barrel and [G7]lend me your ear
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I like [F]beer it makes me a jolly good [C]fellow
I like [F]beer it [D7]helps me unwind 
And sometimes it makes me feel [G7]mellow (makes him feel mellow)
[C]Whiskeys too rough cham[F]pagne cost too [C]much
Vodka puts my mouth in [F]gear
This little refrain should [C]help me [Am]explain
As a [G7]matter of fact I like [C]beer
{end_of_verse}

My wife often frowns [F]when we're out on the [C]town

When I [D7]yell as the waiter [G7]goes by

Then they [D7]turned it all into [G7]wine  (ahhhh)
