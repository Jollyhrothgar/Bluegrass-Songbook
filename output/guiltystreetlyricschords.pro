{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Tonight I lost my way and I found [F]Guilty Street
I saw [G7]faces there I never [F]dreamed I'd [C]see[G7]
I [C]saw the one I love but he did [F]not see me
While the guilty were laughin' 
I was standin' there cryin'
[G7]Alone on Guilty [C]Street
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The [F]lust and sin fill the night 
[C]On Guilty Street where I cry
[F]Guilty Street is the place 
Where [C]happiness died on my [G7]face
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]Tonight he'll hold me close 
And tell me [F]I'm so sweet
But I know what his mind's on 
And tomorrow he'll be gone
[G7]Back to Guilty [C]Street
