{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[Am]Oh those [C]Yellow Creek waters bathed the sons and daughters
Of an [F]Indian nation called the Chero[Am]kee
Then came those [C]pioneer settlers that [Am]drove the Indians westward
[C]Far from their home [F]down on Yellow [Am]Creek
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Now it's [C]many years later I'm living in the nature
In this [F]Indian paradise called Tenne[Am]ssee
Where I [C]find those broken arrows that [Am]flew like the sparrows
The [C]sparrows that still fly [F]down on Yellow [Am]Creek
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Oh those [F]Yellow Creek waters [C]bathed the sons and daughters
Of an [F]Indian nation called the Chero[Am]kee
Through the [F]blood stained years they [C]walk the trail of [Am]tears
[C]Crying for their home [F]down on Yellow [Am]Creek
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Some[C]times my wife and babies think I'm going crazy
When I [F]talk about the things I see and hear when they're [Am]asleep
Like those [C]Indian children playing singing and a [Am]saying
[C]This is their home [F]down on Yellow [Am]Creek
