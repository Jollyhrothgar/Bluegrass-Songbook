[C]I thought by now I was too smart

It’s only a [Am]game that tears you [F]apart
Falling in [G7]love

My poor [C]soul was about to mend
Honey then you [F]smiled at [G7]me and [C]then
Lord help [Am]me here I go [F]again
[G7]Falling in [C]love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Falling in lo-[G7]o-o[C]ve
Falling in [F]lo-[G7]o-o[C]ve
When’ll I [Am]learn I bet I get [F]burned

Looking back through the bridges I burned
Each heart[F]break was a [G7]page I [C]turned
Never for[Am]get the lesson I [F]learned
Falling in [G7]love

Well I [C]was all though until we met
Never gonna [F]love [G7]again and [C]yet
Funny how [Am]soon we all [F]forget
Falling in [C]love
