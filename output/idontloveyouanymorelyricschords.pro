[C]I don't love you [F]any-more [C]not the way [F]I did [C]before
And since you've found someone new I think it's [G7]best

I don't love [F]you anymore for I've got no more love to [C]give
You drained my heart of all its love with [D7]every sweet [G7]caress
I keep [C]saying [F]o'er and [C]o'er I don't love [F]you [C]anymore
Trouble is I don't [G7]love you any [C]less

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I held you close to me [F]one [C]time 
Kissed your [F]lips and called you [C]mine
But another came and thrilled you more I [G7]guess
I [C]cried as you [F]walked out the [C]door 
I don't [F]love you [C]anymore
Trouble is I don't [G7]love you any [C]less

Trouble is I don't [G7]love you any [C]less
