{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]My first taste of Texas had blue-eyes and golden [G]hair
[D7]Beneath a Tennessee silver moon we found a feeling we could [G]share
And [C]age made no difference I’d been around and she was [G]young
But my [D7]first taste of Texas still lingers in my heart and on my [G]tongue 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Her gentle heart was broken
In a [C]way a tender lady shouldn’t have to [G]know
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And mine was somewhere in-between
[C]Something I should hold on to or let [G]go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Her talk and blue-eyes [C]told me
The story of the love she failed to [G]find 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
And without conversation
I [D7]suppose the lines on my face told her [G]mine 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Cause we’re not [C]done  we’ve [D7]only just [G]begun    begun to [C]love
Now the two of us are one   and age [D7]made no [C]difference
We’re still around and love still [G]young
And my [D7]first taste of Texas still lingers in my heart and on my [G]tongue
