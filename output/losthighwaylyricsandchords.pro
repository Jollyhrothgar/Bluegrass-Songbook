{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I'm a rollin' stone all [F]alone and [C]lost
For a life of sin I have paid the [G7]cost 
When I pass [F]by   all the people [C]say
Just another guy on [G7]the lost [C]highway
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Just a deck of cards [F]and a jug of [C]wine
And a woman's lies makes a life like [G7]mine
Oh the day we [F]met I went [C]astray
I started rolling down [G7]that lost [C]highway
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I was just a lad [F]nearly [C]22
Neither good nor bad just a kid like [G7]you
And now I'm [F]lost too late to [C]pray
Lord I paid the cost on [G7]the lost [C]highway
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Now boy's don't start to [F]ramblin' [C]round
On this road of sin are you sorrow [G7]bound
Take my [F]advice or you'll curse the [C]day
You started rollin' [G7]down that lost [C]highway
{end_of_verse}
