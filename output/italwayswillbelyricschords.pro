{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Sometimes I think that love is somewhere 
Livin’ [C7]on an island all [F]alone
I can [G7]see it in the darkness I can feel it 
In the distance and then it’s [C]gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And then I know that it is time for me to go 
And [C7]find my favorite [F]girl
Cause [G7]when I look into her eyes I see all the love 
There is in all the [C]world
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
And it always will [F]be  and it always will [C]be
And it always will [F]be  [G7]it always will [C]be
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus: Repeat 1}
And it always will [F]be  and it always will [C]be
And it always will [F]be  [G7]it always will [C]be
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus: Repeat 2}
And it always will [F]be  and it always will [C]be
And it always will [F]be  [G7]it always will [C]be
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
There are some things I think about 
And every [C7]time I do it breaks my [F]heart
And [G7]there is nothing I can do about this 
Loneliness I feel when we’re [C]apart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
And I stop and curse the darkness 
And the [C7]distance and in your face I [F]see
And [G7]when I look into your eyes 
I see all the love there is inside of [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
And it always will [F]be  and it always will [C]be
And it always will [F]be  [G7]it always will [C]be
{end_of_chorus}
