{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I just heard that city [F]of New [C]Orleans
Go ramblin' past this [F]ol' shack of [C]mine
Yeah the windows carry [F]on 
And the [C]timbers creak and [Am]groan
That [F]ol' girl is [G7]well on down the [C]line
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Some people say it [F]don't get cold in [C]Memphis
But I've seen that ol' [F]river freeze up [C]tight
Yeah she used to melt me [F]down 
Till she [C]caught that southern [Am]belle
[F]Crossed that bridge and [G7]left me cold as [C]ice
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
That ol' train hauled away all the good [F]times
But the pain is here to [C]stay
That ol' train is to blame for the bad [F]times
[D7]I'm living [G7]today
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Well if I [C]could I'd buy [F]myself a [C]ticket
Check out every whistle [F]stop that came [C]along
Cover every mile of [F]track and I'd [C]bring my baby [Am]back
Put a [F]happy [G7]ending to this [C]song
