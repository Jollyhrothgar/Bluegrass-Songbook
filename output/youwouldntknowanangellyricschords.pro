{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Because I won't give in to you 
You don't [C]treat me like you should
You [D7]say that I'm too perfect 
Then you tell me I'm no [G]good
{end_of_verse}

But everyone is guilty 
Of [C]sometimes doin' wrong
But [D7]even so you wouldn't know 
An angel if you [G]saw one
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[D7]No you wouldn't know 
An [G]angel if you saw one
You [A7]won't see any halos 
On the [D]women found in [D7]bars
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I [G]may not get to heaven 
But [C]I'm not the only one
To [D7]tell you so you wouldn't know 
An angel if you [G]saw one
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Now you stand there accusin' me 
Of [C]things you always do
And [D7]half the things you're tellin' me 
Are things I never [G]knew
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
I don't go places you go 
But [C]that's your way of fun
It [D7]goes to show you wouldn't know 
An angel if you [G]saw one
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[D7]No you wouldn't know 
An [G]angel if you saw one
You [A7]won't see any halos 
On the [D]women found in [D7]bars
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I [G]may not get to heaven 
But [C]I'm not the only one
To [D7]tell you so you wouldn't know 
An angel if you [G]saw one
