{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]It's a way of mine to say [G7]just what I'm [C]thinking
And to do the things I [G7]really want to [C]do
And [F]you want to change the part of me I'm proud [C]of
So I can't be [G7]myself when I'm with [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh you never liked the [G7]clothes I wear on [C]Sunday
Just because I don't [G7]believe the way you [C]do
But [F]I believe the Lord knows I'm [C]unhappy 
Cause I can't be [G7]myself when I'm [C]with [C7]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]I can't be myself and be what pleases [C]you
And [F]down deep inside I don't [C]believe that you want me [G7]to
And [F]it's not my way to take so long [C]deciding 
That I can't be [G7]myself when I'm with [C]you
