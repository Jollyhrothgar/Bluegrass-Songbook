[C]Each time I see a [F]Christmas [G7]tree

No [Dm]matter where the tree [G7]is

I'd [C]sure like to [F]see my [G7]folks
I [C]miss 'em so at times like [F]this
But [C]each tree brings them close to [Am]me
No [Dm]matter [G7]where the tree [C]is
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Christmas [F]time has always [G7]been
A [C]family [Em]time to [Am]me 
And [D7]somehow [Am]every [D7]Christmas [Am]tree
[D7]Becomes a family [G7]tree

It [C]makes no difference [F]where I [G7]am
In [C]cities or in [F]towns like this
