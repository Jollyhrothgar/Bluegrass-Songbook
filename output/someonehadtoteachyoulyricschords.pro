[G]Yes I'll take you back again  you knew I [C]would

[D7]Lately someone's taught you how to [G]cry

Someone had to [C]teach you  I [D7]didn't have the heart [G]to
[C]Hurt you just like [D7]you've been hurting me
[G]Someone had to [C]teach you  [D7]things it's time that you [G]knew
Now [C]maybe you'll be [D7]satisfied with [G]me
Someone took your heart and rubbed it  in the [C]dirt
[D7]And that look on your face tells me you [G]hurt
But you had this lesson coming for so very [C]long
Our [D7]sins have a way of coming [G]home
