{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[D7]I quit my job out in the [G]wheat fields
That kind of work just ain't my [Am]style 
And since I [G]didn't have a family
Or a woman to provide for
I [Am]moved into the city for [D7]awhile
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]I was downtown every night 
Till the [Bm]money started getting tight
And I [C]slept out in my car when times were [G]hard
I'd find some lonely street to park
Lock the doors when it got dark
Way [Am]down in the [D7]Kansas City [G]stockyards
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
It never crossed my mind I loved her
I've known lots of girls [Am]before
But she [G]liked the ragged way I looked
Knowing I was broke 
What [Am]man could ever ask for any[D7]more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
And [C]we spent hours all alone
In the [Bm]back seat of my car was home
The [C]world was spinning by with a dis[G]regard
Behind the windows of this field
We found out what love can be
[Am]Way down in the [D7]Kansas City [G]stockyards
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[D7]That old car holds [G]lots of memories
But now the changes are out of [Am]gas
And like the [G]love that used to live there
The shinning days are gone
[Am]Broken down from going much too [D7]fast
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
[C]Back out in the wheat fields now
I [Bm]sweat all day behind the plow
And [C]lay me down to breath beneath the [G]stars
And across the summer night I see
Her in that old car with me
[Am]Way down in the [D7]Kansas City [G]stockyards
[Am]Way down in the [D7]Kansas City [G]stockyards
{end_of_verse}
