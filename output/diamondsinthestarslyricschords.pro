Waking to the morning sun
So content cause you’re the one I [C]hold

Who didn’t know your love was bought or [C]sold

And all your dreams of city life around [F]you
But in a crowd you’re [G7]still alone

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
I'm still the country boy who’ll always know the love

[G7]Right here with the gold that’s in the sun 
And the Diamonds in the [C]stars

As I walk the country roads
I see your face on every rose and [G7]flower

Do you ever think of me
When you walk the lonely streets at [C]night

What would be the price I’d pay
To hear you say you’d come back [G7]forever

All I have to offer
Is love and a simple country [C]life
