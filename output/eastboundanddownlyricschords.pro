{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Eastbound and down [A7]eighteen wheels are rolling
[C]We're gonna do what [D7]they say can't be [G]done
We've got a long way to go and a [A7]short time to get there
[C]I'm eastbound just [D7]watch ole Bandit [G]run
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Keep your [Em]foot hard on the pedal son never [C]mind them brakes
Let it [A7]all hang out 'cause [B7]we got a run to [Em]make
The boys are thirsty in Atlanta and there's [C]beer in Texarkana
And we'll [A7]bring it back no matter what it [B7]takes

Ole [Em]Smokey's got them ears on and [C]he's hot on your trail
[A7]He aint gonna [B7]rest till you're in [Em]jail
So you got to dodge 'em and you got to duck 'em
You got to [C]keep that diesel trucking
Just [A7]put that hammer down and give it [B7]hell
