I [F]got tired of eating supper that was cold and made the day [C]before
I [F]got tired of wading through last weeks junk on the [C]floor
And [D7]when I did find her home I’d find her laying in [G7]bed
[F]Wanting to fuss and hollering loud enough to wake the [G7]dead

Went and found a brand new [F]home
So now you can find me down on the [C]corner 
At a [G7]bar called Kelly’s getting [C]stoned
