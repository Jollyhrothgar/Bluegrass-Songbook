{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I don't feel [F]anything   what was I [G7]worried for
I don't feel love or hate or anything that I [C]felt before
Why was I [F]so afraid   of seeing [G7]you again
Cause it's the strangest thing I don't feel [C]anything
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G7]How I must have loved you [C]once upon a time
[D7]And I can't seem to feel [G7]emotion now of any kind
Why [C]was I so [F]afraid   of what this [G7]night would bring
Cause it's the strangest thing I don't feel [C]anything
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G7]You look the same as always [C]time's been good to you
[D7]But I must confess that time has done a [G7]few things for me too
[C]Why was I [F]so afraid   of seeing you [G7]again
Cause it's the strangest thing I don't feel [C]anything
{end_of_verse}
