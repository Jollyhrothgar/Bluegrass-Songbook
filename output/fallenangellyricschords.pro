{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]She's just  a [G7]fallen angel and I'm the fool who made her [C]fall
Last night I saw an angel the one I once called [F]mine
The [G7]hand that wore my wedding band held a glass of [C]wine
I took her love for granted  I wronged her night and [F]day
I [G7]drove my angel from me and now she's gone [C]a-stray
She's just a  fallen [G7]angel but I don't blame her for it [C]all
She's just a  [G7]fallen angel and I'm the fool who made her [C]fall
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
So many times she told me  she couldn't take me much [F]more
[G7]So many times I laughed at her  and walked right out the [C]door
I wasn't worthy of her and now my angel's [F]gone
The [G7]devil took her from me and claimed her for his [C]own
She's just a  fallen [G7]angel but I don't blame her for it [C]all
She's just a  [G7]fallen angel and I'm the fool who made her [C]fall
{end_of_verse}
