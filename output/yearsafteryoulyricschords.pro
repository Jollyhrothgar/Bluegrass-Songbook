{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I don't [F]know if I can [C]explain it 
Cause there's [F]really nothin' different at [C]all
The [F]sun still burns the [C]earth still turns 
And the [Am]winter still follows the [F]fall
I knew that it wouldn't be [C]easy 
For my heart to find somebody [F]new
But I [Am]never thought it [Dm]still would be broken in [F]two
These [G7]years after [C]you [F]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]They tell me [F]time is a natural [C]healer 
It kind of [F]smooths the pain [C]away
But this [F]hurtin' within hasn't [C]yet given in 
And it's [Am]been over two thousand [F]days
I still remember the taste of your [C]kisses 
And your eyes that were beautifully [F]blue
And I can [Am]still hear the sound of your [Dm]voice 
When you said we were [F]through 
These [G7]years after [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
(Years after years after [F]you) I'm still [G7]cryin'

These [G7]years after [C]you

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
There've been [F]mornin's when I couldn't [C]wake up 
There've been [F]evenin's when I couldn't [C]sleep
My [F]life would be fine for [C]months at a time 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Then I'll [Am]break down and cry for a [F]week
Cause when I told you I'd love you for[C]ever 
I know you didn't think it was [F]true
But for[Am]ever is nothin' [Dm]compared 
To some nights I've been [F]through 
In these [G7]years after [C]you
