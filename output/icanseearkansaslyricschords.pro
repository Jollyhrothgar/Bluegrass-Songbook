{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]There's a natural wonder between us
But it [F]doesn't seem natural to me
[C]That you can walk away from the love we made
[G7]Here in Tennessee
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]Leave everything that we worked for
To [F]start another life
[C]I saw you drive across the Memphis bridge
But [G7]I don't believe my [C]eyes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
I can see [F]Arkansas across the Missi[C]ssippi
I can see a [G7]big river barge headin' down to New Or[C]leans [C7]
I can see the [F]cotton fields on the other side
And the [Fm]sun going down [C]again
Oh I can see [F]Arkansas  but I [G7]still don't see
Why the [F]love we [G7]had should [C]end
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus: Repeat 1}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
If it proved how much I love you
I'd [F]swim this ol' river tonight
[C]I'd bet my soul against the undertow
For the [G7]chance to hold you tight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]But there's more than a river between us
And [F]I can't swim that far
[C]And as hard as I try I just can't drown
The [G7]memories of where you [C]are
