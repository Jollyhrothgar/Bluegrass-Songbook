{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]He was sittin' there his [Dm]brush in hand
[G7]Painting waves as they danced [C]upon the sand[F]
With [C]every stroke he [Dm]brought to life
The [G7]deep blue of the ocean against the [C]morning sky
I [Dm]asked him if he only painted [G7]ocean scenes
He [F]said for twenty dollars I'll [G7]paint you anything
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Could you paint me at [C]Birmingham 
Make it look just the [Am]way I planned
A little house on the [Dm]edge of town 
Porch goin' all the [G7]way around
Put her there in the [C]front yard swing 
Cotton dress make it [Am]early spring
For awhile she'll be [Dm]mine again[G7] 
If you can paint me at Birming[C]ham
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
He looked at me with [Dm]knowing eyes
Then [G7]took a canvas from a bag there by his [C]side
Picked up a brush [Dm]and said to me
Son [G7]just where in this picture would you [C]like to be
I [Dm]said if there's any way you [G7]can
Could you [F]paint me back into her [G7]arms again
