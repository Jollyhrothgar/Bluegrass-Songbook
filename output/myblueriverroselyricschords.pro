[C]There are flowers that are rich there are flowers that are rare

Her [G7]eyes were the petals that glisten so [C]bright
Her smile was the sunshine so [G7]fair

As her [C]tears like the dew [G7]sprinkled [C]there

In the bright month of June neath that old southern moon
At the [F]altar each promise we [C]quote

Of my [C]darling my [G7]Blue River [C]Rose

Her [G7]father objected said think of our [C]pride

Would be [C]up in the [G7]world such as [C]I

Has [C]all withered your [G7]darling is [C]dead
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Now I'm left all alone this old world I must roam
How I'll [F]face every care heaven [C]knows
But each night by light stream I'll still meet her in [F]dreams
My [C]darling my [G7]Blue River [C]Rose
{end_of_verse}
