{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[Am]I say that I'll be all right [C]in a day or two
I [F]say it's just a [C]passin' thing this [G7]thing I've got for [Am]you
I tell myself it's nothin' then I [C]see you walk by
Down [F]inside I [C]ask my heart how [G7]deep in love am [Am]I
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Deep [C]enough to need a lifetime or a [F]hand to shallow ground
I'm [C]chest high in a sea of love and the [G7]waters won't go [C]down
Deep enough to need a savior but [F]there ain't [C]one a[F]round
It [C]won't be long before I'll be [G7]deep enough to [Am]drown
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And I say that I'll forget you this [C]thing I feel will fade
[F]I'll hang on a [C]little while and [G7]it'll go [Am]away
But each night in the darkness when [C]I turn out the light
[F]All alone I [C]ask my heart how [G7]deep in love am [Am]I
