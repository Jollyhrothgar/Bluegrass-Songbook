[C]Cryin' in the darkness
Cause I'm [Em]goin' through another lonely [Am]night
[F]Waiting till the [G7]mornin' brings you [C]hom[G7]e
[C]Tryin' to believe you
Cause you [Em]say each time you're gonna treat me [Am]right
And I'll [F]never spend [G7]another night [C]alone

So I'll take [Em]another chance with [F]you
[D7]Though I know exactly what you'll [G7]do
[C]You'll be gone [Em]until the morning [F]light
[Dm]Leavin' me [G7]another lonely [C]night

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Every creakin' sound I hear
Makes me [Em]sit up and cry out is that [Am]you
But the [F]echo of my [G7]voice is all I [C]hear[G7]
[C]When I reach the point of giving up
I [Em]hear your key unlock the [Am]door
And the [F]eyes that [G7]ask forgiveness
The [F]voice that says I [G7]love you seems [C]sincere
