{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]A lonely town a lonely street a lonely [C]room where I can't [G]sleep
She's on my mind I think about her endless[D7]ly
He bought her [G]big blue diamond rings a car and [C]other costly [G]things
But can he buy the kind of [D7]love she gave to [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The kind of [C]love she gave to me gave it [G]so unselfishly
We planned a home all of our own now that can't [D7]be
He'll buy her [G]furs and silken gowns she never [C]had in Shanty[G]town
But can he buy the kind of [D7]love she gave to [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
She's from across the tracks you know where the [C]bright lights never [G]glow
In Shantytown we live and love so different[D7]ly
She'll have her [G]mansion on the hill but when that [C]house is cold and [G]still
Can he buy the kind of [D7]love she gave to [G]me
{end_of_verse}
