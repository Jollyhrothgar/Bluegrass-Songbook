{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]There’s a city holy city where the [F]streets are paved with [C]gold
And its walls are made of jasper and its [D7]beauty can’t be [G7]told
It’s the [C]home of the redeemed ones who have [F]known God’s saving [C]grace
What a happy glad reunion when we [G7]meet in that [C]place
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
In that city holy city where no [F]tears can dim the [C]eyes
There will be no disappointment there will [D7]be no sacri[G7]fice  
All the [C]saints then will be holy and will [F]live in one [C]accord
There’ll be shouting there’ll be singing when we [G7]meet with the [C]Lord
{end_of_verse}

Over in that holy city we will [F]need no sun to [C]shine
We will walk the streets of glory in that [D7]happy nest of [G7]love

We will sing glad hallelujah in that [G7]home of the [C]soul
