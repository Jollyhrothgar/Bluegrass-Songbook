{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]We're holding on with [F]nothing [C]left to [G7]hold on [C]to
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I'm so tired of [F]holding on to [C]nothing
The years have shown no [F]kindness 
For the [C]hard times we've been [G7]through
[C]We've squeezed the life from every [F]dream 
And still go right on [C]bluffing
[F]With really nothing [C]left [G7]to hold on [C]to
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Oh why do we keep holding [F]on 
With nothing left to hold on [C]to
Let's be honest with each [F]other 
That's the [C]least that we can [G7]do
I feel [C]guilty when they [F]envy me and [C]you
We're holding on with [F]nothing [C]left to [G7]hold on [C]to
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
We were young and [F]foolishly [C]mistaken
Victims of a [F]passion much too [C]strong to be [G7]denied
[C]With only tears to show for all [F]the years that we've been [C]faking
[F]God only knows how [C]long how [G7]hard we've [C]tried
