{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]She looked so much like a [Em]lady but she was [F]so much like [G7]a [F]child
The [Em]devil when she [Am]held me close an [Dm]angel when she [G7]smiled
She [C]always held it [Em]deep inside but somehow [F]I always [G7]knew
She'd [C]go away when the [Em]grass turned green and the [F]sky turned baby [G7][C]blue
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
And baby [C]blue   [Em]was the [F]color of her [G7]eyes
Baby [Em][C]blue   [Am]like the [Dm]Colorado [Em][G7]skies
Like a [Am]breath of spring she came and left and [C]I still don't know [D7]why
[F]So  [Em]here's to you and [Am]whoever holds my [G7]baby blue [F][C]tonight

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
She brought [C]colors to my [Em]life that my [F]eyes had never [F][G7]touched
When [Em]she taught me [Am]how to care I [Dm]never cared so [G7]much
[C]I try not to [Em]think of her but I [F]fall asleep and [G7]do
And [C]drift off where the [Em]grass is green and [F]the sky is [C]baby [G7]blue
