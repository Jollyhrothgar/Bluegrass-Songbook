{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I gotta feeling you been making plans and not including [F]me
I gotta feeling you been doing [G7]things I’m [F]not supposed to [C]see

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Every now and then I see a grin and nothing funny has been [F]said
If I ever thought you’d laugh at [G7]me I’d [F]wish that I were [C]dead
Darling if I found you running round my mind would jump the [F]track
Sometimes I feel like [C]leaving town and [G7]never coming [C]back
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
How it hurts to spend my time alone when my heart cries out for [F]love
You never leave me if you [G7]knew what [F]I’ve been thinking [C]of
As I sit and watch my years go by I count the things they [F]like   
Sometimes I feel like [C]leaving town and [G7]never coming [C]back
{end_of_verse}
