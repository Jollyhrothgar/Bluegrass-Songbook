{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]There’s a girl at the [A7]door please [D7]go answer it dear
I should have [G7]told you before some[C]day she’d be here
She’ll [F]show you a paper [C]proving we said I [A7]do
Then [D7]you’ll know I must go she’ll [G7]take me from you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Sure I [C]love you my [A7]darling so [D7]please let her in
The [G7]time has arrived we must [C]pay for my sins
You [F]won’t have to ask me [C]you’ll know how I [A7]feel
Just as [D7]I know my [G7]darling you can’t keep love you [C]steal
Spoken:

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]Yes we were happily [C]married it’s been some time [A7]ago
And [D7]then something happened what it was I don’t [G7]know
But she left me she’s been [C]gone a long long while
And when I [D7]grew lonely and needed the comfort
Of a companions sweet [G7]smile I found you
And you gave me all the [C]things that she took away
And you’ll never [F]know how I’ve dreaded the thought
That she’d be coming back some [C]day
But [A7]now that she’s here [D7]and there’s nothing we can do
[G7]That paper says I’m hers and the [C]law says we’re through
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Sure I love you my [A7]darling but [D7]go to the door
I [G7]know you’ll forgive though your [C]young heart is sore
Maybe [F]someday if we pray God will [C]hear our [A7]appeal
Through His [D7]mercy and [G7]wisdom we won’t need love you [F]stea[C]l
