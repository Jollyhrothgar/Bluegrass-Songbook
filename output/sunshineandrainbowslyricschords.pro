[C]When I remember Rose I [D7]remember neon lights
[G7]Checkered table cloth and a [C]dress that fits so [G7]tight

You remind me of sunshine and roses baby
[F]Rainbows and [D7]waterfalls warm arms around me so [C]tight
You remind me of twilight and hay rides baby

And you're [C]soft and warm [D7]beside me [G7]baby every [C]night

But [C]still my mind [D7]keeps coming [G7]right back there to [C]you
