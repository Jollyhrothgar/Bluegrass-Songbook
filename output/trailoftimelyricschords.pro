[C]Down a trail of time there's many [B7]sorr[C]ows

For every[C]thing I've ever [B7]want[C]ed
I do not [G7]find but I've done my [C]best
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I can see the [G]stars in the wild blue [C]yonder
And I count each [G]one up in the [G7]sky
I've got them [C]named and when I come to [B7]yours [C]dear
I remember [G7]things and I start to [C]cry
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Down the trail of time the way is [B7]crook[C]ed
I've left be[G7]hind [C]many pleasures [G7]too
I've also [C]left my share of [B7]sorr[C]ows
And that is [G7]why I feel so [C]blue
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I remember [G]two blue eyes that [C]loved me

Sometimes I [G7]wish we'd never [C]met
{end_of_verse}
