[C]I walked out tonight for a ramble round
I didn't mean to stay just to view the [G7]town
When I saw her [F]smilin' from a [C]far
As she walked into [G7]that crossroads [C]bar
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Well I walked inside and sat me down
Ordered sweet red wine and I drank it [G7]down
She came and [F]set beside me [C]there
With a dark brown eyes [G7]and the red red [C]hair
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I told her that I love her true
Anything you want I'll surely [G7]do
Said a man like [F]you don't get too [C]far
With a girl like me [G7]at the crossroads [C]bar
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I like smokey lights and a lonesome song
And I won't do right if I can do you [G7]wrong
You want the moon to [F]burn behind the darkest [C]star
And you won't find love [G7]at the crossroads [C]bar
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Come all my friends and take my advice
Keep your love at home with your lovely [G7]wife
You're better [F]off than you think you [C]are
And you won't find love [G7]at the crossroad [C]bar
{end_of_verse}
