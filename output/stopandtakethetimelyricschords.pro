{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I never realized how much I missed till I lost you
Little things like that just never crossed my [G7]mind
[F]But now my heart has [G7]opened up and [F]swallowed all my [C]pride
And it’s [G7]all because I never even stopped to take the [C]time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [F]never tried to [G7]understand or [F]look into your [C]eyes
To [D7]kiss your lips hold you tight and [G7]try to realize
The [C]way I treated you I‘d rather be out of your [F]mind
And it’s [G7]all because I never even stopped to take the [C]time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I [F]said I could [G7]find the words [F]to tell you how I [C]feel
What [D7]do you say when you’ve lost every[G7]thing in life that’s real
You [C]deserve much more than me and I hope someday you’ll [F]find
Some[G7]one who’ll love you as you are and stop to take the [C]time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Some[G7]one who’ll love you as you are and stop to take the [C]time
