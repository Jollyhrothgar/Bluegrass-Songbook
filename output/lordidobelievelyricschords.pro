{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Lord there’s no way that I can make it [C]up to [D7]you
The cross of shame and all the pain [G]that you went through
A crown of thorns put on your head
They [G7]nailed your hands and [C]feet
Ful[D7]filling their salvation plans
Lord I do [G]believe
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Lord I believe death couldn’t hold you [C]in the [D7]grave
From Heaven angels came and rolled the [G]stone away
You paid the price no other could
To [G7]set your people [C]free
I [D7]know my soul is in your hands
Lord I do [G]believe
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I believe that anytime you [C]come a[D7]gain
Your call will bring us to the king we shall [G]enter in
Unworthy when I kneel to pray
For [G7]all you’ve done for [C]me
With [D7]humble heart I thank you
Lord I do [G]believe 
{end_of_verse}
