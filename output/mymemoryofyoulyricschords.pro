[C]You said I'd for[F]get that [G7]we'd ever [C]met

Oh you spoke many words but a [F]lot I never heard
And the [D7]sound has my heart broke in [G]two[G7]
As you [C]walked up [C7]with him my [F]whole world went [Dm]dim
Oh I [G7]can't shake this memory of [C]you

Yes there's one thing [C7]you gave that [F]I'll take to my [Dm]grave
I [G7]can't shake this memory of [C]you
