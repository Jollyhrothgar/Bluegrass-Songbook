{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I realize how difficult it is for you to take me as I [Dm]am
And knowin' that you're [G7]not the first 
To love me makes the difference in a [C]man
But I feel no shame or guilty conscience knowing the way my moral [Dm]stand
But my one big mistake in life is lettin' down [G7]my strength
Just to satisfy the weakness in a [C]man
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
So [F]here I [G7]am  [F]now you're all of [G7]my [C]yesterdays
Just [F]take my [G7]hand if [F]you can't see yourself with [G7]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I [C]know my past must hurt you but baby I do the best I [Dm]can
To [G7]live with things I did before without a wedding ring upon my [C]hand
Oh you know it seems so funny that the story should end as it [Dm]began
But my one big mistake in life was lettin' down [G7]my strength
Just to satisfy the weakness in a [C]man
{end_of_verse}
