[G]I had everything this world has to [C]offer
And I [D7]held all the pleasures by the [G]pail
I thought that I would never have a [C]need
In my [D7]heart I believed I’d never [G]fail

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I was [C]drinking my way down to eterni[G]ty
Down in the deepest darkness I was [D7]lost
But my [G]Lord set me free completely [C]gave me victo[G]ry
I [C]traded the [G]bottle and the [D7]world for the [G]cross
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I was living a life un[C]believing
[D7]Everyday closer to the [G]end
A sinner filled with pride and [C]unsaved
I was [D7]tied to the world full of [G]sin
