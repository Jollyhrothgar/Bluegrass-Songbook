{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]What goes wrong with the [G7]mind of a [C]man in a [G]bar
Who sits and keep drinking with his [A7]thoughts strayed so [D7]far
It's the [G]same old sad [G7]story that has [C]often been [G]told
One [C]drink then [G]another till [D7]he's out of con[G]trol
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
He sits down at a [G7]table with his [C]hands on a [G]glass
For him there's no future [A7]there's only the [D7]past
He [G]reaches for the [G7]bottle but his [C]hands don't take [G]hold
His [C]eyes just can't [G]focus [D7]he's out of con[G]trol [G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Does he [C]search for contentment that [G]he might hope to find
From a [A7]honky tonk woman or the [D7]bottles of wine
[G]He shakes and he [G7]trembles even [C]though he's not [G]old
Like [C]a leaf in a [G]whirlwind [D7]he's out of con[G]trol
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Yes I'm just like that [G7]fellow who [C]sits there all [G]alone
With no one to love me [A7]no family at [D7]home
I'm a [G]picture of [G7]others with a [C]future so [G]cold
A [C]life ain't worth [G]livin' [D7]when it's out of con[G]trol
{end_of_verse}
