[G]I was born in a Cabin on the [C]Mountain,
[G]60 years ago I left for [D]city life
[G]I moved job to job and soon I [C]prospered
[G]And married Cindy [D]Lou, my faithful [G]Darlin’ wife

[G]Now Cindy Lou is singin’ with the angels,
[C]My sons have wives and children of their [G]own.
[G]Time to pack my clothes, my savings, and my memories,
[G]and retire to that [D]mountain cabin [G]home

{soc}
[C]My Mountain cabin home is now a [G]Walmart
[G]There’s condos in the hills I used to [D]roam
[G]There's a apple store, a target, and a [C]costco
[G]But not a Trace of my [D]Mountain Cabin [G]Home
{eoc}

[G]No more hunting, no more fishing, no more logging
[C]Bring your credit card or iphone, no more [G]cash
[G]Now the only hunting left upon the mountain,
[G]Is a bear hunting [D]food in dumpster [G]trash

[G]I pondered in the food court over pizza,
[C]This wasn’t the retirement I [G]planned,
[G]I went on-line while having frozen yoghurt,
[G]To learn how we were [D]kicked off our [G]land

[G]Two hundred years we lived up the mountain,
[C]Our title to the land was lost in [G]time,
[G]The country grabbed the mountain top for Westfield,
[G]We never saw a [D]dollar or a [G]dime

[C]My mountain cabin home is now a [G]Walmart
[G]There’s condos in the hills I used to [D]roam
[G]There’s a Chick-fil-a, McDonald’s, and a [C]Starbucks,
[G]But not a trace of my [D]mountain cabin [G]home

[G]Our mountain cabin home was cold and drafty
[C]The winter snow would freeze you to your [G]bones
[G]Now the whole wide world is hot and getting hotter,
[G]Wish I were freezing in our [D]mountain cabin [G]home

[G]So, I’ll go back to the comforts of the city,
[C]To my power, shower, microwave and [G]phone,
[G]But late at night my mind will go on wandering,
[G]Oh how I miss that [D]old mountain cabin [G]home.

[C]My mountain cabin home is now a [G]Walmart
[G]There’s condos in the hills I used to [D]roam
[G]There’s a fitness gym, a hair salon, a [C]sports bar,
[G]But not a trace of my [D]mountain cabin [G]home

[G]There’s a Ford, and Chevy, Subaru, and [C]Honda,

[D]A sign was painted said "Private [G]Property"
[C]But on the backside, it [G]didn't say nothing
[D]This land was made for you and [G]me

[C]The voice was chanting as the [G]fog was lifting
[D]This land was made for you and [G]me
