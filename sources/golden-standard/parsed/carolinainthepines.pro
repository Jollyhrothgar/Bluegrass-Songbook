{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]She came to me, said she [Am]knew me Said she'd [C]known me a long [G]time
[Am]And she spoke of being in [Bm]love With every [C]mountain she had [D]climbed
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G]And she talked of trails she'd [Am]walked up
[C]Far above the timber[G]line
[Am]From that night on I knew I'd [Bm]write songs
[C]With Carolina in the [D]pines
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
[C]There's a new moon on the [G]fourteenth, [C]first quarter the [G]21st
[C]And the full moon in the [G]last week brings a [Am]fullness to this [D]earth
[C]There's no guesswork in the [G]clockwork on the [C]worlds heart or [G]mind
[C]There are nights I only [G]feel right With [Am]Carolina in the [D]pines
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G]When the frost shows on the [Am]windows And the [C]wood stove smokes and [G]glows
[Am]As the fire grows we can [Bm]warm our souls Watching [C]rainbows in the [D]coals
[G]And we’ll talk of trails we’ve [Am]walked up [C]Far above the timber[G]line
[Am]There are nights I only [Bm]feel right With [C]Carolina in the [D]pines
{end_of_verse}
