{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]As I look at the letters that you [C]wrote to me

[G]I re[D]member our faded [G]love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
[G]I miss you darlin' more and more [C]everyday
[G]As heaven would miss the stars a[D]bove
[G]With every heartbeat, I still [C]think of you
[G]And re[D]member our faded [G]love
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G]As I think of the past, and all the [C]pleasures we had

[G]I re[D]member our faded [G]love
