{key: G}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Now tonight I'm sad, my heart is weary
[C]I'm wondering if I'm wrong or [G]right
[C]To dream about you though you left me
[G]I wonder [D]where you are to[G]night
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
[C]The rain is cold and slowly falling
[D]Upon my window pane to[G]night
[G]And though your love was even [C]colder
[G]I wonder [D]where you are to[G]night
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G]Your heart was cold, you never loved me
[C]Though you often said you [G]cared
[C]But now you've gone to find another
[G]Someone who [D]knows the love I [G]shared
{end_of_verse}

{chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G]Then came the dawn the day you left me
[C]I tried to smile with all my [G]might
[C]But you could see the pain within me
[G]That lingers [D]in my heart to[G]night
{end_of_verse}
