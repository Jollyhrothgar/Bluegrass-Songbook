{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]While walking one day in the country
[C]I saw a gathering [G]crowd
[C]And as my footsteps drew me [G]closer
[G]I smelled the sweet [D]fragrance of [G]flowers
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G]It looking like a family reunion
[C]had my eyes not counted the [G]tears
[G]And an old man sat by a graveyard
[G]I haven’t seen [D]Mary in [G]years
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
[C]Hold to my hand and [G]lead me
[C]Lead me away from [G]here
[C]I just brought these flowers for [G]Mary
[G]I haven’t seen [D]Mary in [G]years
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G]When Mary and I were first married
[C]we had such plans for our [G]child
[G]But for no reason I started rambling
[G]and like the four [D]winds I just went [G]wild
{end_of_verse}

{chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[G]If I could live my life over
[C]I would bring Mary such [G]cheer
[G]Now she’s gone where she’ll never meet me
[G]I haven’t seen [D]Mary in [G]years
{end_of_verse}

{chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[G]Then the old man left the graveyard
[C]and I walked right by his [G]side
[G]I called his name but through all his shame
[G]his son he did [D]not recog[G]nize
{end_of_verse}
