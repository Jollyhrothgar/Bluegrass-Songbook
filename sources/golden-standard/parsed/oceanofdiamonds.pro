{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Some people drink champagne out under the [C]stars
[D]While others drink wine leaning over a [G]bar
[C]But all that I need dear to make me feel fine
[D]Is to know that your love will forever be [G]mine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
[C]I give a ocean of diamonds a world filled with [G]flowers
[D]To hold you closely for just a few [G]hours
[G]Hear you whisper softly that you love me [C]too
[D]Would change all the dark clouds to the [G]bluest of blue
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G]I don't drink their champagne and I don't drink their [C]wine
[D]So if you refuse me, my poor heart will [G]pine
[C]I'll be so lonely till the day that I die
[D]And as long as I live dear, you'll still hear me [G]cry
{end_of_verse}
