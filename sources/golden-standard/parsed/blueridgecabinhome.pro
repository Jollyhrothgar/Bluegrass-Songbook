{key: G}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]There's a well beaten path on this [C]old mountainside
[D]Where I wandered when I was a [G]lad
[G]And I wandered alone to the [C]place I call home
[D]In those Blue Ridge hills far a[G]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
[G]Oh I love those hills of old [C]Virginia
[D]From those Blue Ridge hills I did [G]roam
[G]When I die won't you bury me [C]on the mountain
[D]Far away near my Blue Ridge mountain [G]home
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G]Now my thoughts wander back to the [C]ramshackle shack
[D]In those Blue Ridge hills far a[G]way
[G]My mother and dad they’re [C]laid there to rest
[D]They are sleeping in peace together [G]there
{end_of_verse}

{chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G]I return to that old cabin [C]home with a sigh
[D]I've been longing for days gone [G]by
[G]When I die won't you bury me on that [C]old mountainside
[D]Make my resting place upon the hills so [G]high
{end_of_verse}
