{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I'd rather be in some [D]dark [G]hollow

[G]Would cause me to [D]lose my [G]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
[G]So blow your whistle freight train
[C]Carry me farther on down the [G]track
[G]Well I'm going [C]away I'm leaving today
[G]I'm going but I [D]ain't coming [G]back
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G]I'd rather be in some [D]dark [G]hollow
[C]Where the sun don't ever [G]shine
[G]Than to be [C]in some big city
[G]In a small room with your [D]love on my [G]mind
{end_of_verse}

[G]Or to know you won’t [D]ever be [G]mine
