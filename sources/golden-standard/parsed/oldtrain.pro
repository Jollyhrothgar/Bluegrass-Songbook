{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Old train I can [F]hear your whistle [C]blow [D]
[C]But I won’t be [D]jumping on a[G]gain
[G]Old train I’ve been [F]everywhere you [C]go [D]
[C]And I know what [D]lies beyond each [G]bend.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
[C]Old train each time you [D]pass you’re older [C]than the [D]last [G]
[D]And it seems I’m too [A]old for running [D]
[C]I hear your rusty [D]wheels grate a[C]gainst the [D]rails [G]
[D]They cry with every [C]mile and I think I’ll stay a[G]while.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G]Old train I grow [F]weary at the [C]miles [D]
[C]And I miss the [D]freedom that was [G]mine
[G]Old train just to [F]think about those [C]times [D]
[C]And I’ll smile when [D]you’re high-balling [G]by.
{end_of_verse}
