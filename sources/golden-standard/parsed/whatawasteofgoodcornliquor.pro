{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I have lost my blue-eyed darling, Now I sit with a [C]broken heart
[G]By my cabin in the [D]Carolina hills
[G]Oh I loved a shiner's daughter Loved her true with [C]all my heart
[G]Till she fell into her [D]pappy's liquor [G]still

[G]Oh what a waste of good corn liquor From the still [D]they pulled the plug
[G]All the revenuers snickered 'cause she [C]melted in the [G]liquor
[G]And they had to bury [D]poor Lilly by the [G]jug
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G]Cousin Cale upon the juice harp played a mighty mournful tune
[G]Kinfolks all bowed their heads and gathered round
[G]Then I heard the parson sing Drink me only with thine eyes as we watch them pour poor Lilly in the ground

{chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G]Now I'm sitting in the twilight Neath the weeping willow tree The sun is slowly sinking in the west
[G]And I'm clasping to my bosom A little jug of Lilly Mae
[G]With a broken heart I'm longing for the rest.
{end_of_verse}
