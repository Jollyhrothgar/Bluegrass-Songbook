{key: G}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]It's been ten long [B]years since I [C]left my [G]home
[G]In the hollow where I was [D]born
[G]Where the cool fall [B]nights make the [C]wood smoke [G]rise
[D]And the foxhunter blows his [G]horn
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
[G]I fell in love with a [B]girl from the [C]town [G]
[G]I thought that she would be [D]true
[G]I ran away to [B]Charlottesville And [C]worked in a sawmill [G]too
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[D]What have they done to the [G]old home place
[A]Why did they tear it [D]down
[G]And why did I [B]leave the [C]plow in the [G]field
[G]And look for a [D]job in the [G]town
{end_of_verse}

{chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G]Well the girl ran [B]off with [C]somebody [G]else
[G]The tariffs took all my [D]pay
[G]And here I [B]stand where the [C]old home [G]stood
[G]Before they [D]took it a[G]way
{end_of_verse}

{chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[G]Now the geese fly [B]south and the [C]cold wind [G]moans
[G]As I stand here and hang my [D]head
[G]I've lost my [B]love I've [C]lost my [G]home
[G]And now I wish that [D]I was [G]dead
{end_of_verse}
