  "raw_lyrics": "Who done it who was it broke your heart\nWho done it who keeps us apart\nYou gamble with the love I gave until another won it\nSo when you find your all alone just ask yourself who done it\n\nThere was a time when you were mine and I belonged to you\nYou broke your vow so listen now while I give you a clue\nI gave my heart to someone new because you tried to shun it\nYou want it back but its to late and your the one who done it\n\nI offered you a bungalow with roses round the door\nA diamond ring and everything but still you wanted more\nYou wanted to run your own life so I just let you run it\nAnd when your dream train jumped the track I guess you know who done it",
