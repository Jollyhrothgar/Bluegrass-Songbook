  "raw_lyrics": "In that dear old village churchyard\nI can see a mossy ground\nThat is where my mother\u2019s sleeping\nIn the cold and silent ground\n\nI was young but I remember\nWhen the night my mother died\nThere I saw her spirit fading\nWhen she called me to her side\n\nSaying Darlin I must leave you\nAngels voices guide you home\nPray that we may meet in heaven\nWhen your mother\u2019s dead and gone\n\nOft I wander to the churchyard\nFlowers to plant with tender care\nOn the grave of my dear mother\nDarkness finds me weeping there\n\nLooking at the stars above me\nWaitin for an early dawn\nThere by mother I\u2019ll be buried\nAnd no more be left alone",
