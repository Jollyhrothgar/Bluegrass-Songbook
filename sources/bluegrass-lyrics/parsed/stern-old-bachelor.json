  "raw_lyrics": "I am a stern old bachelor\nMy age is forty four\nI do declare I\u2019ll never live\nWith women anymore\n\nI have a stove that\u2019s worth ten cents\nA table worth fifteen\nI cook my gruel in oyster cans\nAnd keep my things so clean\n\nOh little sod shanty\nLittle sod shanty give to me\nFor I\u2019m a stern old bachelor\nFrom matrimony free\n\nWhen I come home at night\nI smile and walk right in\nI never hear a voice yell out\nOr say where have you been\n\nOn a cold and stormy night\nIn a cozy little shack\nI sing my songs and think my thoughts\nWith no one to talk back\n\nI go to bed when ever I please\nAnd get up just the same\nI change my socks three times a year\nWith no one to complain\n\nAt night when I\u2019m on peaceful sleep\nMy snores can do no harm\nI never have to walk the floor\nWith a baby in my arms\n\nAnd when I die and go to heaven\nAs all good bachelors do\nI will not have to grieve for fear\nMy wife will get there too",
