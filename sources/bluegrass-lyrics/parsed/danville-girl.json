  "raw_lyrics": "My pocket book was empty\nMy heart was full of pain\nTen thousand miles away from home\nBumming the railroad train\n\nIt was standing on the platform\nSmoking a cheep cigar\nlistening for that next freight train\nTo carry an empty car\n\nWell I got off at Danville\nGot stuck on the Danville girl\nYou bet your life she\u2019s out of sight\nShe wore those Danville curls\n\nShe took me in her Kitchen\nShe treated me nice and kind\nShe got me in the notion\nOf bumming all the time\n\nShe wore her hair on the back of her head\nLike high-tone people do\nBut the very next train come down the line\nI bid that girl adieu\n\nI pulled my cap down over my eyes\nWalked down to the track\nThen I caught a westbound freight\nNever did look back",
