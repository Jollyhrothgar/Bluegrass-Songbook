  "raw_lyrics": "As I went down for to take a little walk\nI came upon that Wild Bill Jones\nHe was a walking and a talking by my true lover\u2019s side\nAnd I bid him to leave her alone\n\nHe said my age is twenty-one\nToo old to be controlled\nI pulled my revolver from my side\nAnd I destroyed that poor boy\u2019s soul\n\nHe reeled and he staggered, and he fell to the ground\nAnd then he gave one dying moan\nHe wrapped his arms around my little girl\u2019s neck\nSaying honey won\u2019t you take me home\n\nSo put them handcuffs on me boys\nAnd lead me to that freight car gate\nI have no friends or relations there\nNo-one for to go my bail\n\nSo pass around that old long necked bottle\nAnd we\u2019ll all go on a spree\nFor today was the last of that Wild Bill Jones\nAnd tomorrow will be the last of me\n\nThey sent me to prison for twenty long years\nThis poor boy longs to be free\nBut Wild Bill Jones and that long-necked bottle\nHave been the ruin of me",
