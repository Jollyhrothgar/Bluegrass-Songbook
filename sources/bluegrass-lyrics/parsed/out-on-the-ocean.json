  "raw_lyrics": "I am sailing out on the ocean\nMany miles from home on sea\nAnd I wonder little darlin\nIf you ever think of me\n\nI am just on old true lover\nRoaming through this world alone\nAnd I have no one to love me\nThrough this life I\u2019ll always own\n\nI was once carefree and happy\nWhen I won my sweetheart\u2019s hand\nAnd now my life is empty\nSince she\u2019s wed another man\n\nDo you remember little darlin\nJust how much I cared for you\nAnd you told me that you loved me\nBut you proved to be untrue\n\nI am travelling far away dear\nMany miles from this old place\nAnd I know I\u2019ll never forget you\nYour sweet smiles and happy face\n\nI can hear my mother calling\nI can see my father pray\nIf I\u2019d listened to my father\nI would be at home today",
