  "raw_lyrics": "How many times have I seen you with a tear upon your check\nAnd that beautiful attempt at a smile\nYou wave good-bye and wish me well and don\u2019t forget to write\nOnce again I have you counting the miles\n\nThe pained expression in your face\nThe frailty of your form\nAs you slowly faded from my sight\nIt\u2019s a picture in my memory I never will forget\nThough I haven\u2019t seen your face in a while\n\nAlways looking toward the next horizon\nNever looking back on where I\u2019ve been\nTomorrow is another day you know that I\u2019ll be back someday\nI guess that\u2019s just the way the story ends\nFor I find myself alone without a friend\n\nYou know for every fond farewell there always was hello\nAnd I hoped that it would help to ease your pain\nAnd now I stand in these new shoes\nthe tears are rollin\u2019 down\nFor I know I\u2019ll never see your face again",
