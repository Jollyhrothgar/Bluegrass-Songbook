  "raw_lyrics": "As I was out walking down by the seashore\nI met a fair maiden she sure did look grand\nHer lace and her diamonds and her hair shone like gold\nShe appeared to be eighteen or nineteen years old\n\nHer fingers they jingled like bells on a door\nHer nose was turned up but not very much more\nWhen we were married the wedding bells told\nI have married a young lady just nineteen years old\n\nWhen we were married and retired for our rest\nMy love changed for her why you can guess\nFor a box full of powders my love did unfold\nShe appeared to be eighteen or nineteen years old\n\nShe raked from her pale cheeks a box full of paint\nWhen she took out her false teeth I thought I would faint\nOut upon the carpet her glass eye did roll\nShe appeared to be eighteen or nineteen years old\n\nShe unsnapped her fingers I counted just three\nThen she unscrewed both cork legs up to her knees\nWhen she took off her false wig her old bald head told\nI had married an old lady about ninety years old",
