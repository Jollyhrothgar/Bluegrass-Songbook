  "raw_lyrics": "Back in the days when I was a lad\nThere was only one thing that could make me glad\nA good bunch of biscuits a good batch of biscuits\nMama could make mighty good gravy\nAnd there was never no buts nor maybes\nWe\u2019d get biscuits a good bunch of biscuits\n\nPapa didn\u2019t cuss but just a little bit\nBut if mama didn\u2019t cook \u2019em he\u2019d throw a big fit\nPass me them biscuits those High Life biscuits\nAnd us little kids all sixteen of us\nIf mama didn\u2019t make \u2019em you could hear us fuss\nI want another biscuit a good bunch of biscuits\n\nThree times a day seven days a week\nWe just couldn\u2019t resist it\nClean up the plate that was our fate;\nWe didn\u2019t leave a solitary biscuit\nI don\u2019t see how mama ever did make \u2019em\nEnough to keep up with the way we ate \u2019em\nA good bunch of biscuits a fine bunch of biscuits\n\nI love a man sop red-eyed gravy\nWith a biscuit so light it\u2019ll drive you crazy\nA good bunch of biscuits a good bunch of biscuits\nMost of us kids had our fingernails nipped\nIt was caused by grabbin\u2019 them hot-fried biscuits\nGoodness gracious they\u2019re good biscuits\n\nI turned eighteen I got me a wife\nOughtta be slapped for it the rest of my life\nBut I got biscuits a fine bunch of biscuits\nIf I ever get rich we\u2019ll have a lot more\nBut I\u2019ll keep eatin\u2019 just like I was before\nGoodness gracious they\u2019re good biscuits\n\nA good bunch of biscuits a fine bunch of biscuits\nGoodness gracious I got biscuits",
