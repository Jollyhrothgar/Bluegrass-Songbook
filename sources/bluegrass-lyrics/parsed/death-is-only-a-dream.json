  "raw_lyrics": "Sadly we sing and with tremulous breath\nAs we stand by the mystical stream\nIn the valley and by the dark river of death\nAnd yet \u2019tis no more than a dream\n\nOnly a dream, only a dream\nOf glory beyond the dark stream\nHow peaceful the slumber, how happy the waking\nWhere death is only a dream\n\nWhy should we weep when the weary ones rest\nIn the bosom of Jesus supreme\nIn the mansions of glory prepared for the blessed\nFor death is no more than a dream\n\nNaught in the river the Saints should appall\nThough\u2019 it frightfully dismal may seem\nIn the arms of our Savior no ill can befall\nThey find it no more than a dream\n\nOver the turbid and onrushing tide\nDoth the light of eternity gleam\nAnd the ransomed the darkness and storm shall out ride\nTo wake with glad smiles from their dream",
