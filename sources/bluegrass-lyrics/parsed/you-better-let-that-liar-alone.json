  "raw_lyrics": "Just let me tell you how a liar will do\nHe\u2019s always coming with something new\nHe\u2019ll steal your heart with false pretence\nMaking out like he\u2019s your bosom friend\nIf you don\u2019t want to get in trouble\nIf you don\u2019t want to get in trouble\nIf you don\u2019t want to get in trouble\nBetter let that liar alone\n\nWhen a liar takes the notion to bend the truth\nHe\u2019ll lay around his neighbors and get the news\nAnd nearly every day when you look out\nYou can see that liar coming to your house\n\nHe\u2019ll tell you such a lie it\u2019ll surprise your mind\nHe\u2019ll mix a little truth for to make it shine\nWhen he gets his business fixed just right\nThen that liar\u2019s going to cause a fight\n\nHe studies up a lie he\u2019ll tell it so smooth\nYou\u2019ll think absolutely that it must be true\nAnd he\u2019ll urge you out for to trace the tale\nAnd if you don\u2019t mind you\u2019ll be put in jail\n\nWhen everything\u2019s in perfect peace\nThen comes that liar with his deceit\nA hypocrite liar both keeps up a fuss\nThey\u2019re both very bad but a liar\u2019s the worse",
