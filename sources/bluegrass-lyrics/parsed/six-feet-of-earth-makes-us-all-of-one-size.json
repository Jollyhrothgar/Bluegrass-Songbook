  "raw_lyrics": "I\u2019ll sing you a song of the world and its ways\nAnd the many strange people you meet\nFrom the rich man who\u2019s rolled in his millions of gold\nTo the poor struggling wretch on the street\nBut a man tho\u2019 he\u2019s poor and in tatters and rags\nWe should never affect to despise\nBut think of the adage remember my friends\nThat six feet of earth makes us all of one size\n\nThere\u2019s the rich man with thousands to spare if he likes\nBut he haughtily holds up his head\nAnd who thinks he\u2019s above the mechanic who toils\nAnd is honestly earning his bread\nBut his gold and his jewels he can\u2019t take away\nTo the world up above when he dies\nFor death levels all and conclusively shows\nThat six feet of earth makes us all of one size\n\nThere\u2019s many a coat that is tatter\u2019d and torn,\nThat beneath lies a true honest heart\nBut because he\u2019s not dressed like his neighbors in style,\nWhy \u201csociety\u201d keeps them apart;\nFor on one fortune smiles, while the other one fails,\nYes no matter what venture he tries,\nBut time calls them both to the grave in the end\nAnd six feet of earth makes us all of one size\n\nThen when you once see a poor fellow that tries,\nTo baffle the world and its frown,\nLet us help him along and perhaps he\u2019ll succeed\nDon\u2019t crush him because he is down,\nFor a cup of cold water for charity\u2019s sake,\nIs remembered with joy in the skies,\nWe\u2019re all of us human, we\u2019ve all got to die,\nAnd six feet of earth makes us all of one size",
