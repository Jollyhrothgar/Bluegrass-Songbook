  "raw_lyrics": "In the beautiful hills, way back in Roane Country\nThere\u2019s where I roamed for many long years\nThere\u2019s where my heart\u2019s been tending most ever\nThat\u2019s where the first step of misfortune I made\n\nI was about thirty years when I courted and married\nAmanda Gilbraith I then called my wife\nBut her brother stabbed me for some unknown reason\nJust three months later I\u2019d taken Tom\u2019s life\n\nFor twenty five years this whole world I rambled\nI went to old England to France and to Spain\nBut I thought of my home way back in Roan Country\nI boarded a steamer and came back again\n\nI was captured and tried in the village of Kingston\nNot a man in the county would speak one kind word\nWhen the jury came in with the verdict next morning\nA lifetime in prison was the words that I heard\n\nWhen the train pulled out poor mother stood weepin\nAnd sister she sat alone with a sigh\nAnd the last words I heard was Willie God bless you\nWas Willie God bless you, God bless you, good bye\n\nSweet Martha was grave but Corey was better\nThere\u2019s better and worse, although you can see\nBoys when you write home from the prison in Nashville\nPlace one of my songs in your letter for me",
