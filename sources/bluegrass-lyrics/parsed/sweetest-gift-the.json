  "raw_lyrics": "One day a mother came to a prison\nTo see an erring but precious son\nShe told the warden how much she loved him\nIt did not matter what he had done\n\nShe did not bring to him parole or pardon free\nShe brought no silver, gold no pomp or style to see\nIt was a halo bright brought down from heaven\u2019s light\nThe sweetest gift, a mother\u2019s smile\n\nHer boy had drifted far from the fireside\nthough she had pleaded with him each night\nYet not a word did she ever utter\nThat told her heartaches her smile was bright\n\nShe left a smile you can remember\nShe\u2019s gone to heaven from heartaches free\nThose bars around you could never change her\nYou were her baby and e\u2019er will be",
