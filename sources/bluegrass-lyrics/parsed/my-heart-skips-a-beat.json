  "raw_lyrics": "Oh my heart skips a beat when we walk down the street\nI feel a trembling in my knees\nJust to know you\u2019re mine until the end of time\nMakes my heart skip a beat\n\nWell I did a double take the day I met you\nMy heart turned a flip as I stood next to you\nAnd I knew right then I never could forget you\nYou are my every dream come true\n\nWell you came into my life without a warning\nTurned my cloudy skies from gray to blue\nYou\u2019re my sunshine that comes up every morning\nYou are my every dream come true",
