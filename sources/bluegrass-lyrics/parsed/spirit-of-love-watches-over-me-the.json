  "raw_lyrics": "There are gongs from a gage\nLike a beautiful dream\nAnd I seek there in vain\nBy the meadow and stream\nOft I breathe out your name\nTo the wind floating by\nBut the sweet voice is\nNew to my cry\n\nIn the stillness of night\nWhen the stars mildly shine\nMy heart fondly holds\nA communion with God\nFor I feel though art near\nAnd where e\u2019er I may be\nThat the spirit of love\nWatches over me\n\nOft the birds in the bower\nNow companions I make\nEvery temple wild flower\nI prize for the sake\nDeep woods and dark clouds\nCan a pleasure impart\nFor the solitude\nSuits my poor heart\n\nThough art gone from a gage\nAnd I will not repine\nHere lonely shall meet\nIn a home that is thine\nFor I feel though art near\nAnd where e\u2019er I may be\nThat the spirit of love\nWatches over me",
