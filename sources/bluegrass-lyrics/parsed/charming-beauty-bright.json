  "raw_lyrics": "Once I courted a fair beauty bright,\nAnd on her I placed my whole heart\u2019s delight;\nI courted her for love, and her love I did obtain\nDo you think I\u2019ve any reason of love to complain?\n\nBut when her old father came this for to know\nThat me and his daughter together would go,\nThey locked her up and kept her so severe\nThat I never got sight but once more of Molly, my dear\n\nAnd then I was forced to her father\u2019s to go\nTo see whether my true love had forgot me, yes or no,\nShe made me this reply with the tears all in her eyes\nI never will forget you until the day I die\n\nAlthough they keep me so tightly confined\nBut that is no reason I shall alter my mind,\nI might have had a man and a man of high degree\nBut I always will prove kind to the man that loves me\n\nThen I was forced to the army to go\nTo see whether I could forget my love or no;\nBut when I got in sight with my armor shining bright\nIt made me think of Molly, my heart\u2019s delight\n\nThen seven long years I served one old king\nAt the end of seven years I returned home again\nWith my heart so full of grief and my eyes so full of tears\nOh how happy I\u2019d a-been to got sight of my dear\n\nO then I was forced to her father\u2019s to go\nTo see whether my true love had remained, yes or no\nThe old woman saw me come, she wrung her hands and cried\nSaid,\u201d Sir, my daughter loved you, and for your sake she died\u201d\n\nO then I was struck like a man that was slain\nThe tears from my eyes fell like showers of rain,\nMy grief, my grief, it is more than I can bear\nMy true love is in her grave and I wish I was there",
