  "raw_lyrics": "It\u2019s been ten long years since I left my home\nIn the hollow where I was born\nWhere the cool fall nights make the wood smoke rise\nAnd the foxhunter blows his horn\n\nI fell in love with a girl from the town\nI thought that she would be true\nI ran away to Charlottesville\nAnd worked in a sawmill or two\n\nWhat have they done to the old home place\nWhy did they tear it down\nAnd why did I leave the plow in the field\nAnd look for a job in the town\n\nWell my girl she ran off with somebody else\nThe taverns took all my pay\nAnd here I stand where the old home stood\nBefore they took it away\n\nNow the geese they fly south and the cold wind blows\nAs I stand here and hang my head\nI\u2019ve lost my love I\u2019ve lost my home\nAnd now I wish that I was dead",
