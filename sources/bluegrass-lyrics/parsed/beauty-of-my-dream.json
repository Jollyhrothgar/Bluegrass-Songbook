  "raw_lyrics": "One day I met the beauty of my dreams\nPretty eyes she had you ought-a seen\nBrown hair that flowed down behind\nI saw it all and yet I was so blind\n\nWe wound up in her part of town\nBright lights with our music all around\nI gazed into her eyes and she in mine\nShe had me in a trance it was so fine\n\nNow I cry cry cry\nI can\u2019t get over her though I try\nI\u2019m blue blue blue\nI should have known she never could be true\n\nWell I find as the night has faded on\nI found your house the neighbors say your gone\nThe girl she don\u2019t live here anymore\nOh the pain to me that lies in store\n\nSo all I have is a picture in a frame\nShe disappeared the same way she came\nShe made a wreck of me and I find\nShe\u2019s out of sight but always on my mind",
