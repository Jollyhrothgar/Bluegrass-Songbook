  "raw_lyrics": "If  I could only go back home again\nTo see the hills and feel the wind\nI\u2019d walk the road to where it all began\nAnd find the man I lost back home again.\n\nIt\u2019s been awhile since I\u2019ve been home\nI miss the place I come from and the smell of the old wood smoke\nI close my eyes I can see all of my favorite memories\nHow I wish I could go back home again.\n\nThe lamp is dim time moves slow\nThe night owl sings a song I know the darkness seems an old familiar friend\nThe falling rain and gentle winds rock my soul to sleep again\nA quiet place this peaceful dream of home.",
