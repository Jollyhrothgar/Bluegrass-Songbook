  "raw_lyrics": "There\u2019s a lonely cottage by the sea side\nWhere the water lillies through the shore\nIt was there I passed my happy childhood\nWith a loved one that\u2019s gone before\n\nThen give me back my dear old home\nThat old home by the sea\nAnd I never will wander far away\nFrom my home my dear old cottage home\nYodel\n\nMany years have passed since there I wandered\nBut the old cottage has been forgot\nAnd my heart in fancy oft returned\nTo that dear old familiar spot\n\nYes my heart is like the humming sea shell\nThat tells of its birth where ere it roams\nI will sing of my cottage by the sea shore\nOf my home my dear old cottage home",
