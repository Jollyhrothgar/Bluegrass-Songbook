  "raw_lyrics": "What a friend we have in mother\nWho will all our secrets share\nWe should never keep things from her\nTell her all and she\u2019ll be there\n\nOh what tender love she gives us\nWhen in sorrow or despair\nTell her gently whisper softly\nShe will listen she\u2019ll be there\n\nDay by day as she grows older\nShe\u2019s the nation\u2019s shining sun\nDon\u2019t forget the prayers she taught you\nYou will need them where you are\n\nThough her hair has turned to silver\nSend her flowers sweet and fine\nDrop a card or send a letter\nShe\u2019ll be waiting she\u2019ll be there\n\nWhen her eyes are closed to slumber\nGently kiss her icy brow\nFold her hands upon her bosom\nShe will rest in Heaven now\n\nWhen your days are dark and dreary\nAnd your cross is hard to bear\nDo not let your memory fail you\nThink of mother she\u2019ll be there",
