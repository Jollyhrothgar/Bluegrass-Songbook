  "raw_lyrics": "On the banks of the river where the willows hang down\nAnd the wild birds all warble with a low moaning sound\nDown in the hollow where the waters run cold\nIt was there I first listened to the lies that you told\n\nNow I lie on my bed and I see your sweet face\nThe past I remember time cannot erase\nThe letter you wrote me it was written in shame\nAnd I know that your conscience still echo\u2019s my name\n\nNow the nights are so long, Lord sorrow runs deep\nAnd nothing is worse than a night without sleep\nI\u2019ll walk out alone and look at the sky\nToo empty to sing, too lonesome to cry\n\nIf the ladies were blackbirds and the ladies were thrushes\nI\u2019d lie there for hours in the chilly cold marshes\nIf the ladies were squirrel\u2019s with high bushy tails\nI\u2019d fill up my shotgun with rock salt and nails",
