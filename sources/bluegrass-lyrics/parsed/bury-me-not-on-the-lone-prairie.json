  "raw_lyrics": "O bury me not on the lone prairie\nThese words came low and mournfully\nFrom the cold pale lips of a youth who lay\nOn his dying bed at the close of day\n\nHe\u2019d wasted time til upon his brow\nThe shadowed clouds were gatherin\u2019 now\nHe thought of his home and his friends so nigh\nOh the cowboys gathered to see him die\n\nI fancy I\u2019ll listen to the well known word\nOf the free wild wind and the song of birds\nHe thought of his home and the cottonwood there\nAnd the songs her learned in his childhood hour\n\nI often thought I\u2019d be laid when I die\nIn the old churchyard by the green hillside\nBy the side of my father let my grave be\nO bury me not on the lone prairie\n\nO bury me not on the lone prairie\nWhere the wild coyotes may howl over me\nWhere the buffalo roams and the winds blow free\nO bury me not on the lone prairie\n\nI want to be laid where mothers prayers\nAnd sisters tears will mingle there\nWhere friends will come and weep over me\nO bury me not on the lone prairie\n\nO bury me not and his voice fell there\nWe heeded not his dying prayer\nIn a narrow grave just six by three\nWe buried him there on the lone prairie\n\nWe buried him there on the lone prairie\nWhere the buzzards fly and the wind blows free\nWhere rattlesnakes rattle and the tumbleweeds\nBlow across his grave on the lone prairie",
