  "raw_lyrics": "There\u2019s a little grave on the green hillside that lies to the morning sun\nAnd the way worn feet often wander there when the cares of the day are done\nWe sometimes sit in the twilight fall and talk of a far off land\nAnd we sometimes feel in the twilight there the touch of a vanished hand\n\nGrave on the green hillside grave on the green hillside\nIn the years to come we will calmly sleep in a grave on the green hillside\n\nAnd this land is full of these little graves in the valleys plains and hills\nThere\u2019s angel too for each little grave an angel procession fills\nI know not how but I sometimes think that they lead us with gentle hand\nAnd a whisper falls on a willing ear from the shore of a far off land\n\nAnd these little graves are but wayside marks that point to a far off land\nAnd they speak to the soul of a better day of a day that\u2019s near at hand\nThough we first must walk through the chartless fields yet Christ will be our guide\nWe will reach the shore of a far off land through a grave on a green hillside",
