  "raw_lyrics": "\u2018Twas battered and scarred and the auctioneer\nThought it scarcely worth his while\nTo waste much time on the old violin\nBut he held it up with a smile.\n\nWhat am I bidden, good folks, he cried\nWho will start bidding for me?\nA dollar, a dollar \u2013 then Two! Only two?\nTwo dollars, and who\u2019ll make it three?\nThree dollars, once; three dollars, twice;\nGoing for three \u2013 But no\n\nFrom the room far back a gray haired man\nCame forward and picked up the bow;\nThen wiping the dust from the old violin\nAnd tightening the loose strings\nHe played a melody pure and sweet\nAs sweet as a caroling angel sings.\n\nThe music ceased and the auctioneer\nWith a voice that was quiet and low\nSaid What am I bidden for the old violin?\nAnd he held it up with the bow.\nA thousand dollars, and who\u2019ll make it two?\nTwo thousand! And who\u2019ll make it three?\nThree thousand once; three thousand, twice;\nAnd  going, and gone! said he.\n\nThe people cheered and some of them cried\nWe do not understand What changed its worth?\nSwift came the reply:\nThe touch of the master\u2019s hand.\n\nAnd many a man with life out of tune\nAnd battered and scattered with sin\nIs auctioned cheap to the thoughtless crowd\nMuch like the old violin.\n\nA \u201cmess of pottage  a glass of wine;\nA game \u2013 and he travels on.\nHe\u2019s \u201cgoing\u201d once and \u201d going\u201d twice\nHe\u2019s \u201cgoing\u201d and \u201calmost gone.\u201d\n\nBut the Master comes and the foolish crowd\nNever can quite understand\nThe worth of a soul and the change that\u2019s wrought\nBy the touch of the Master\u2019s hand.",
