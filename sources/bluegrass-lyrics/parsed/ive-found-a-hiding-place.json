  "raw_lyrics": "High on that lonesome road to heaven\u2019s blessed abode\nFor many years I was burdened with care\nSo often lightening flashed and raging billows dashed\nMy sorrow then was so heavy to bear\n\nBut since my Jesus came I praise his holy name\nHe sheds the light of his wonderful grace\nAnd every night and day to him I steal away\nI found a blessed hiding place\n\nI found a hiding place a blessed hiding place\nI said a hiding a blessed hiding place\nThere\u2019s glory in my soul my hallelujah rolls\nBut since my Jesus came I\u2019m under his control\n\nHe keeps me night and day He answers when I pray\nAnd from the raging storm to Him I steal away\nI hear those temptors knock I feel no temply shock\nOh in the solid rock I found a hinding place\n\nJust like a wandering Jew that had no place to choose\nEach day I had to keep travelin\u2019 on\nBut now I\u2019ve found the way that leads to endless days\nNo more in darkness I wander alone\nWhen Satan would alarm I climb in God\u2019s strong arm\nAnd hide away in his loving embrace\nFor in the solid rock the blessed solid rock\nI found a blessed hidin\u2019 place",
