  "raw_lyrics": "They tell me today you are going\nFar away just to make you a name\nThey tell me that you\u2019re discontented\nAnd that you are search-ing for fame\n\nDon\u2019t say goodbye if you love me\nFor \u2018twould make my heart overflow\nKiss my lips once ere you leave me\nJust don\u2019t say goodbye when you go\n\nSomehow I can\u2019t realize we\u2019re parting\nI have grown used to having you near\nThe strings in my heart love are breakin\u2019\nI just can\u2019t say good-bye to you dear\n\nEach night as I kneel by my bedside\nI will pray one sweet prayer for just for you\nI will ask of the kind one in heaven\nJust to make all your dreams dear come true",
