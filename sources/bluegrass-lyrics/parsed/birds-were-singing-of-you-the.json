  "raw_lyrics": "Last night the pale moon was shining\nLast night when all was still\nI wandered alone in sadness\nOut among the woodland hills\n\nI heard the birds a-singing\nOut among the trees and views\nAnd every bird, my darling\nWas singing, was singing of you\n\nWas singing, singing of you, my love\nWas singing, was singing of you\nAnd every bird, my darling\nWas singing, was singing of you\n\nI think of you in the daytime\nI dream of you at night\nI wake and wish you were here, love,\nAnd tears are blinding my sight\n\nThe flowers that slumber so sweetly\nThe stars above the blue\nOh heaven itself, my darling\nIs thinking, is thinking of you\n\nI open my window so gently\nAnd look on the dreamy view\nThe world itself, my darling\nIs sighing, is sighing for you",
