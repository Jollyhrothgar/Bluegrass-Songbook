  "raw_lyrics": "They called old John from the island\nAnd they put him in the kettle to boil\nAnd the Lord came down from heaven above\nAnd they tell me that the oil wouldn\u2019t boil\n\nOh he had the keys to the kingdom\nAnd the faith unlocked the door\nOh he had the keys to the kingdom Lord\nAnd the world couldn\u2019t do him no harm\n\nThe king said to the Hebrew\nWhen they were about to sound\nBefore you worship that idol God\nGet ready to bow down\n\nWell they put old Paul and Silas\nDown in the jail below\nWhile one did sing and the other did shout\nAnd the angel unlocked the door\n\nGo get your trumpet Gabriel\nAnd move down by the sea\nBut don\u2019t you blow that trumpet\nUntil you hear from me\n\nWhen you think that you\u2019ve been living right\nAnd serving God every day\nJust fall down on our bended knees\nHe\u2019ll hear every word you say",
