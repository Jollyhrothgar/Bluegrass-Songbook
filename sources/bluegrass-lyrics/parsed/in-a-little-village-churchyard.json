  "raw_lyrics": "In a little village churchyard\nThere I see a grassy mound\nThere my sweetheart lies a-sleeping\nIn the cold and silent ground\nGently waves the weeping willow\nBirds they warble sweet and low\nAnd there\u2019s no one left to love me\nSince my sweetheart had to go\n\nIn that little village churchyard\nThere I stray with a broken heart\nThere is no one left to love me\nSince the day we had to part\n\nThat sad day will I remember\nWhen she called me to her side\nHow I watched her spirit fading\nAnd the tears did blind my sight\nThen she said, \u2018Goodbye my darling\nDry those teardrops from your eyes\nPromise me, my little darling\nThat you\u2019ll meet me up on high\u2019\n\nIn that little village churchyard\nThere I stray with a broken heart\nThere is no one left to love me\nSince the day we had to part\n\nOft I\u2019ve wandered to the graveyard\nFlowers to plant with tender care\nO\u2019er the grave of my dear darling\nDarkness finds me weeping there",
