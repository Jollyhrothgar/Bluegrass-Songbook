  "raw_lyrics": "Was on the high high holy day\nThe very best day in the year\nLittle Matty Groves had gone to church\nHoly words for to hear\nHoly words for to hear\n\nThe first to come down was dressed in red\nAnd the second one dressed in green\nThe third to come down was Lord Daniel\u2019s wife\nAs fair as any queen\nJust as fair as any queen\n\nThen Matty Groves says to one of his men\nSee the fair one dressed in white\nAlthough she is Lord Daniel\u2019s wife\nI\u2019ll be with her tonight\nI\u2019ll be with her tonight\n\nWell the little foot page was standing by\nAnd heard every word that was said\nHe says Lord Daniel shall know tonight\nBefore I go to bed\nBefore I go to bed\n\nHe had 15 miles for to go that night\nAnd 10 of them he run\nHe run til he come to the broke down bridge\nThen he bent to his breast and swum\nHe bent to his breast and swum\n\nHe swum til he come to where the grass was green\nHe took to his feet and he run\nHe run til he come to Lord Daniel\u2019s Gate\nThen he rattled at the bells and they rung\nHe rattled at the bells and they rung\n\nWhat news What news Lord Daniel says\nWhat news to me have you brung\nLittle Matty Groves is in the bed with your wife\nAnd their hearts both beat as one\nAnd their hearts both beat as one\n\nNow if the truth you\u2019ve told to me\nA rich man you shall be\nBut if a lie you\u2019ve told to me\nI\u2019ll hang you to a tree\nI\u2019ll hang you to a tree\n\nHe gathered him up about 50 good men\nHe done it with a free good will\nThen he popped his bugle unto his lips\nAnd he blowed it loud and shrill\nHe blowed it loud and shrill\n\nI\u2019d better get up said little Matty Groves\nI\u2019d better get up and go\nI know your husband is a coming home\nFor I heard his bugle blow\nI heard his bugle blow\n\nLay down lay down my precious one\nLay down and go to sleep\nIt\u2019s only my father\u2019s shepherd\u2019s horn\nAnd he\u2019s a calling for his sheep\nHe\u2019s a calling for his sheep\n\nSo they laid down together again\nAnd they soon were fast asleep\nAnd when they awoke it was broad daylight\nLord Daniel at their feet\nLord Daniel at their feet\n\nGet up from there your naked man\nAnd put you on some clothes\nI never intend for to have it said\nThat a naked man I slow\nThat a naked man I slow\n\nOh give me a chance said little Matty Groves\nA chance to fight for my life\nFor there you have two very fine swords\nAnd me not as much as a knife\nAnd me not as much as a knife\n\nOh yes I have two very fine swords\nAnd they cost me deep in the purse\nYou may have the finest one\nAnd I will take the worst\nYes I will take the worst\n\nThen Matty Groves struck the very first lick\nAnd he wounded Lord Daniel sore\nLord Daniel struck the very next lick\nAnd he drove Matty Groves to the floor\nHe drove Matty Groves to the floor\n\nThen he taken his lady by the hand\nAnd he sat her on his knee\nAnd he says Now which do you love the best\nLittle Matty Groves or me\nLittle Matty Groves or me\n\nVery well I like your rosy cheeks\nVery well I like your chin\nBut better I love little Matty Groves\nThan you and all of your kin\nThan you and all of your kin\n\nYou can dig my grave on a pretty green hill\nDig it wide and deep\nAnd put little Matty Groves in my arms\nLord Daniel at my feet\nLord Daniel at my feet",
