  "raw_lyrics": "Lay up nearer brother nearer\nFor my limbs are growing cold\nAnd thy presence seemeth dearer\nWhen thine arms around me fold\n\nI am dying brother dying\nSoon you`ll miss me in your berth\nFor my form will soon be lying\n`Neath the ocean`s briny surf\n\nTell my father when you see him\nThat in death I prayed for him\nPrayed that I might only meet him\nIn a world that`s free from sin\n\nTell my mother God assist her\nNow that she is growing old\nThat her child would glad have kissed her\nWhen his lips grew pale and cold\n\nListen brother catch each whisper\n`Tis my wife I speak of now\nTell oh tell her how I miss her\nAs the fever burns my brow\n\nTell her she must kiss my children\nLike the kiss I last impressed\nHold them as when last I held them\nHeld them closely to my breast",
