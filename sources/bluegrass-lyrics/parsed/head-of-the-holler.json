  "raw_lyrics": "Have you ever been to the head or the holler\nThat\u2019s where the big dogs romp and waller\nThe women there are long and lean\nAnd some I fear are apt to be mean\n\nRoll on head out\nYou\u2019ll like it there\u2019s no doubt\nThere ain\u2019t no better place to be\nThan the head of the holler in Kentucky\n\nThe first time I went to the head of the holler\nI wore a bow tie and a snow white collar\nWhen daylight came come crawlin\u2019 in\nAnd the best thing I wore was a silly grin\n\nThe next time I went to the head of the holler\nI saw more moon that I could swaller\nI flew like a bird and a tryin to sing\n\u2018Til I fell from a tree and broke one wing\n\nNow my gal lives in the head of the holler\nHer love shines like a silver dollar\nShe feeds me butter staight from the churn\nAnd her ma and pa don\u2019t give a durn\n\nI\u2019m a going back to the head of the holler\nYou can go too if you want to follow\nBut don\u2019t you fool with that gal of mine\nI\u2019ll cut you down like a lonesome pine",
