  "raw_lyrics": "She walks through the corn leading down to the river\nHer hair shone like gold in the hot morning sun\nShe took all the love that a poor boy could give her\nAnd left me to die like a fox on the run\nLike a fox, like a fox, like a fox, like a fox, on the run\n\nEverybody knows, the reason for the fall\nWhen woman tempted man down in paradise\u2019s hall\nThis woman tempted me, and took me for a ride\nLike the lonely fox, I need a place to hide\n\nWe\u2019ll pour a glass of wine, to fortify our soul\nWe\u2019ll talk about the world and friends we used to know\nI see a string of girls, who\u2019ll put me on the floor\nThe game is nearly over and  the hounds are at my door",
