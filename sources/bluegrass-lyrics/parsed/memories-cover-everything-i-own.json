  "raw_lyrics": "This morning found me down and troubled hurting deep inside\nAnd if I thought it might do some good I guess I could have cried\nYour memory crept into my heart like a winter morning chill\nIt chilled my heart my blood ran cold I guess I love you still\n\nI try my best to think of ways to keep your memory still\nYou left a place in spite of me that time can\u2019t seem to kill\nThe pieces of my broken heart just never seem to fit\nThere\u2019s one still missing when I rearrange I guess I love you yet\n\nThe  snow lays in the trees and turns at night from white to blue\nI\u2019m looking to replace a life of dreams I lost with you\nYes I\u2019ll be trying to fill my time so that I\u2019m not alone\nBut old memories of what used to be cover everything I own",
