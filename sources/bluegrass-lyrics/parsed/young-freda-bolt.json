  "raw_lyrics": "Amid the Blue Ridge Mountains\nThere lived a maiden fair\nWhose life was pure as heaven\nWhose life was free from care\n\nShe dreamed of love and romance\nWith heart so glad and free\nNo gloom within the future\nYoung Freda Bolt could see\n\nNearby lived dear young Harmon\nA boy she loved so well\nAnd of these two young lovers\nA story I will tell\n\nTwas late one Thursday evening\nThe stars were shinning dim\nThat dear one called his sweetheart\nTo come and go with him\n\nHe told her on tomorrow\nThat they would surely wed\nBut little was she thinking\nHe\u2019d take her life instead\n\nThey motored to Clinch Mountain\nA place so dark and lone\nAnd there her form so helpless\nHe placed beneath the stones\n\nAway from home and mother\nThat Freda loved so well\nThe bitter pain and anguish\nNo mortal tongue can tell\n\nThrough tears she pled for mercy\nThough he denied her cry\nYoung Harmon left his sweetheart\nIn agony to die\n\nWe think that God in heaven\nMust surely heard her cry\nAnd sent a band of angels\nTo linger very nigh\n\nAnd bare her spirit over\nTo yonder happy shore\nWhere dying comes no never\nAnd parting is no more",
