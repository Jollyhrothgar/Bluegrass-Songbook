  "raw_lyrics": "Last night I laid down everything was so fine\nHad mother and dad so much on my mind\nThinking of home and the ones I love so\nEverything was so great around the old home\n\nThen I woke up I was a dreaming\nNo mother no dad no children a playing\nEverything was so quiet everybody was gone\nThere was nothing left but a lonesome old home\n\nThen I got up the sun was so bright\nI looked all around but something\u2019s not right\nI walked out the door and there on a hill\nStood two lonesome graves Lord it gave me a chill\n\nAs I stood there everything was so still\nAs I started to leave those lonesome old hills\nLeaving behind where I used to roam\nMomma and dad and a lonesome old home",
