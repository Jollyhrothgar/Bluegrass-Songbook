  "raw_lyrics": "First thing I remember knowing was a lonesome whistle blowing\nAnd a young ones dream of growing up to ride\nOn a freight train leaving town not knowing where I\u2019m bound\nNo one could steer me right but mama tried.\n\nOne and only rebel child from a family meek and mild\nMy mama seemed to know what lay in store\nIn spite of all my Sunday learning towards the bad I kept on turning\n\u2018Til mama couldn\u2019t hold me anymore.\n\nAnd I turned twenty-one in prison doing life without parole\nNo one could steer me right but mama tried mama tried\nMama tried to raise me better    but her pleading I denied\nThat leaves only me to blame cause mama tried.\n\nMy dear old daddy rest his soul left my mom a heavy load\nShe tried so very hard to fill his shoes\nWorking hours without rest wanted me to have the best\nShe tried to raise me right but I refused.",
