  "raw_lyrics": "Hug me close dear mother closer\nPut your arms around me tight\nFor I am cold and tired, dear mother\nAnd I feel so strange tonight\n\nSomething hurts me here, dear mother\nLike a stone upon my breast\nOh I wonder, wonder mother\nWhy it is I cannot rest\n\nAll the day as you were working\nAnd I lay upon my bed\nI was trying to be patient\nAnd to think of what you said\n\nHow the King, Blessed Jesus\nLoves His lambs to watch and keep\nOh, I wish He would come and take m\nIn His arms that I might sleep\n\nJust before the lamps were lighted\nJust before the children came\nWhile the room was very quiet\nI heard someone call my name\n\nAll at once a window opened\nOn a field of lambs and sheep\nSome far out were in a brook drinking\nSome were lying fast asleep\n\nIn a moment I was looking\nOn a world so bright and fair\nWhich was filled with little children\nAnd they seemed so happy there\n\nThey were singing oh so sweetly\nSweetest songs I ever heard\nThey were singing sweeter mother\nThan our own little birds\n\nBut I could not see the Savior\nThough I strained my eyes to see\nAnd I wonder if He saw me\nWould He speak to such as me\n\nAll at once a window opened\nOne so bright upon me smiled\nAnd I knew it must be Jesus\nWhen He said come here, my child\n\nCome up here, little Bessie\nCome up here and live with me\nWhere little children never suffer\nSuffer through eternity\n\nThen I thought of all you told me\nOf that bright and happy land\nI was going when you called me\nWhen you came and kissed my hand\n\nAnd at first I felt so sorry\nYou had called, I would go\nOh, to sleep and never suffer\nMother, don\u2019t be crying so\n\nHug me close dear mother closer\nPut your arms around me tight\nOh how much I love you mother\nAnd how strong I feel tonight\n\nAnd her mother pressed her closer\nTo her own dear burdened breast\nOn the heart so near it\u2019s breaking\nLay the heart so near it\u2019s rest\n\nAt the solemn hour of midnight\nIn the darkness calm and deep\nLaying on her mother\u2019s bosom\nLittle Bessie fell asleep",
