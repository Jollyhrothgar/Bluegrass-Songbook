  "raw_lyrics": "While walking one day in the country\nI saw a gathering crowd\nAnd as my footsteps drew me closer\nI smelled the sweet fragrance of flowers\n\nIt looking like a family reunion\nhad my eyes not counted the tears\nAnd an old man sat by a graveyard\nI haven\u2019t seen Mary in years\n\nHold to my hand and lead me\nLead me away from here\nI just brought these flowers for Mary\nI haven\u2019t seen Mary in years\n\nWhen Mary and I were first married\nwe had such plans for our child\nBut for no reason I started rambling\nand like the four winds I just went wild\n\nIf I could live my life over\nI would bring Mary such cheer\nNow she\u2019s gone where she\u2019ll never meet me\nI haven\u2019t seen Mary in years\n\nThen the old man left the graveyard\nand I walked right by his side\nI called his name but through all his shame\nhis son he did not recognize\n\nHold to my hand and lead me\nlead me away from here\nHow could I know it was Mama\nI haven\u2019t seen Mary in years",
