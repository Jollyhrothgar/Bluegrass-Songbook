  "raw_lyrics": "Far away in a Spanish dungeon\nA Cuban soldier lay\nSlowly dying from the torture\nInflicted day by day\nHe begged to send a message\nBut this kindness was denied\nSo he called his comrades to him\nAnd told his story ere he died\n\nWhen Cubie gains her freedom\nAnd the Spaniards cease to reign\nThere\u2019s a loved one on that island\nI will never see again\nOh  find her for me comrades\nAnd tell her you were by my side\nAnd I bid you take this message\nTo a soldiers promised bride\n\nTis the same old story comrades\nLove weeps when beauty is done\nWhen Cubie was struggling for her freedom\nI was ordered to my gun\nThough I\u2019m a captain dying\nThe struggle will soon be o\u2019er\nTell her I said to meet me\nWhere the soldiers fight no more",
