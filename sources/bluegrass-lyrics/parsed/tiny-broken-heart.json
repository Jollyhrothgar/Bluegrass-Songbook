  "raw_lyrics": "He was just a little farm lad so busy at play\nIn his little playhouse down by the gate\nHe stopped to watch a truck that was parking next door\nAt the home of his tiny playmate\n\nThen he saw his Daddy watching too\nAs the man swiftly walked to the cottage door\nHe knew they were strangers that come from the town\nMen he had never seen before\n\nThey soon were at their work and he heard his Daddy say\nOur neighbors are moving today\nOh no, he cried, dear God don\u2019t let it be\nThey can\u2019t take my sweetheart away\n\nI know Dad that you don\u2019t understand\nHow a heart so young could conceive a plan\nI\u2019m only seven now but it\u2019s just like you say\nDaddy someday I\u2019ll be a man\n\nThe man who owns the farm where your playmate now lives\nHe told me it has to be this way\nFor winter time has come and their work is all done\nAnd now they are moving away\n\nLet us buy the farm so they can stay\nGive them all my toys that dear Santa gave\nAnd give him the pennies in my little bank\nPennies that my darling helped me save",
