  "raw_lyrics": "In my memory there\u2019s a little mountain homestead\nAnd the flowers are still growing on the lawn\nNow each time I go back home the tears start falling\nHow I miss my darling since she\u2019s gone\n\nShe\u2019s gone to join a happy band of angels\nTo sing for endless ages at God\u2019s throne\nThe best friend I ever had is now with Jesus\nHow I miss my darling Mother since she\u2019s gone\n\nThere\u2019ll never be another friend like Mother\nNo one can do the things for me she done\nNor can fill the vacant place she left here\nHow I miss my darling mother since she\u2019s gone",
