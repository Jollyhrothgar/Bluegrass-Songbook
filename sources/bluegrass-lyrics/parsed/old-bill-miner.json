  "raw_lyrics": "Way down in old Kentucky boys on one winter\u2019s morn\nIn eighteen forty-seven Old Bill Miner was born\nBut nothing ever suited Bill at least that\u2019s what they say\nAnd at the age of thirteen years one night he ran away\nFrom ranch to California ranch he did his life enjoy\nWhen asked his occupation there he would reply cowboy\nWith a rocky mountain highway man Bill LeRoy some say\nThey robbed until LeRoy was hung and old Bill got away\nIn Turkey and in London \u2018twas there he could be free\nA desert raider a slave trader he soon became you see\nRunning guns in Rio and South Americae\nThen robbing trains in the diamond fields of old North Africae\nHands up boys hold them steady the usual command\nFrom old Bill Miner the gentleman bandit a six gun in his hand\nRobbing trains all his life he would often say\nAin\u2019t no jail that can hold me I\u2019ll surely get away\nOh I\u2019ll surely get away\nBack home in California he robbed the Sonora state\nSan Quentin prison and twenty years brought him the middle age\nAnd they let him out for being good in nineteen hundred one\nThe twentieth century was young he bought himself a gun\nUpon that mainline CPR he stopped the fast mail train\nGot a life in New Westminster Bin in the ol\u2019 Victoria rain\nBut Bill was good to his word and knew what he was about\nThirty-five feet of tunnel in nineteen seven he dug out\n\nHead wide so? for Georgia in a manner grand and slow\nHe robbed the southern rail express his hair was white as snow\nCaught by W.A. Minster that persistent Pinkerton man\nTell me now just who you are was his gruff command\nI am G.W.Edwards a-standing in the mud\nGeorge Anderson William Miner or maybe old Bill Mud\nBill broke out of the Georgia bin in the swampy waist-deep water\nThey hunted him down with dogs and guns for three miles and a quarter\nAnd way down south in Milledgeville no hope for a pardon\nOld Bill tended to the flowers in the penitentiary garden\nBut sometimes old memories are all that we can keep\nAnd two years later to the day old Bill died in his sleep",
