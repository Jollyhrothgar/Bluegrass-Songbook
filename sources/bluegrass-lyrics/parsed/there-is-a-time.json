  "raw_lyrics": "There is a time for love and laughter\nThe days will pass like summer storms\nThe winter wind will follow after\nBut there is love and love is warm\n\nThere is a time for us to wander\nWhen time is young and so are we\nThe woods are greener over yonder\nThe path is new the world is free\n\nThere is a time when leaves are fallin\u2019\nThe woods are gray the paths are old\nThe snow will come when geese are callin\u2019\nYou need a fire against the cold\n\nSo do your roaming in the springtime\nAnd you\u2019ll find your love in the summer sun\nThe frost will come and bring the harvest\nAnd you can sleep when day is done",
