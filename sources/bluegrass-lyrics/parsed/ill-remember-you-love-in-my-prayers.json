  "raw_lyrics": "When the curtains of night are pinned back by the stars\nAnd the beautiful moon sweeps the sky\nWhen the dew drops of heaven are kissing the rose\nIt is then that my memory flies\n\nUpon the wings of some beautiful dove\nTo hasten the message of cheer\nI\u2019ll send you a kiss of affection and say\nI\u2019ll remember you, Love, in my prayers\n\nWhen the angels of heaven are guarding the good\nAs God has ordained them to do\nIn answer to prayers that I offered to Him\nI know there\u2019s one waiting for you\n\nGo where you will on land or on sea\nI\u2019ll share all your sorrows and cares\nAnd at night when I kneel by my bedside to pray\nI\u2019ll remember you, Love, in my prayers\n\nMay the angels be with you and guard you through life\nAnd guide you up Heaven\u2019s bright stairs\nAnd know that I love you wherever you roam\nI\u2019ll remember you, Love, in my prayers",
