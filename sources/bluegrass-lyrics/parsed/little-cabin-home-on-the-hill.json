  "raw_lyrics": "Tonight I\u2019m alone without you my dear\nIt seems there\u2019s a longing for you still\nAll I have to do now is sit alone and cry\nIn our little cabin home on the hill\n\nOh, someone has taken you from me\nAnd left me here all alone\nJust to listen to the rain beat on my window pane\nIn our little cabin home on the hill\n\nI hope you are happy tonight as you are\nBut in my heart there\u2019s a longing for you still\nI just keep it there so I won\u2019t be alone\nIn our little cabin home on the hill\n\nNow when you have come to the end of the way\nAnd  find there\u2019s no more happiness for you\nJust let you thoughts turn back once more if you will\nTo our little cabin home on the hill",
