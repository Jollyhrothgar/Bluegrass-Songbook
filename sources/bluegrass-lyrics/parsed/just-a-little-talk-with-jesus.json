  "raw_lyrics": "I once was lost in sin but Jesus took me in\nAnd then a little light from heaven filled my soul\nIt bathed my heart in love and wrote my name above\nAnd just a little talk with Jesus made me whole\n\nNow let us have a little talk with Jesus\nLet us tell Him all about our troubles\nHe will hear our faintest cry\nHe will answer by and by\nNow when you feel a little prayerwheel turning\nAnd you know a little fire is burning\nYou will find a little talk with Jesus makes it right\n\nSometimes my path seems drear without a ray of cheer\nAnd then a cloud of doubt may hide the light of day\nThe mists of sin may rise and hide the starry skies\nBut just a little talk with Jesus clears the way\n\nI may have doubts and fears my eyes be filled with tears\nBut Jesus is a friend who watches day and night\nI go to Him in prayer He knows my every care\nAnd just a little talk with Jesus makes it right\n\nYou will find a little talk with Jesus makes it right\nMakes everything right",
