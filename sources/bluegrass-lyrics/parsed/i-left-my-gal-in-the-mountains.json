  "raw_lyrics": "I left my gal in the mountains left her standing in the rain\nWent down to the railroad caught myself a midnight train\nI beat my way into Georgia landed in a gambling town\nGot myself into trouble shot a county sheriff down\n\nThe jury read the verdict murder in the first degree\nThe judge said take this prisoner to the penitentiary\nThey put the handcuffs on me put me on a pullman tain\nTook me to Atlanta boys and tied me to a ball and chain\n\nI left my gal in the mountains left her standing all alone\nLast night I dreamed I got a letter saying honey won\u2019t you come back home\nShe said she was sad and lonely told me that her love was true\nThen I dreamed I wrote her a letter saying honey I\u2019m coming back to you\n\nWhen I woke up this morning lying in Atlanta jail\nNo one here to love me no one to go my bail\nThem prison bars all around me a guard walking by my door\nMy heart is sad and lonely boys cause I\u2019ll never see my gal no more",
