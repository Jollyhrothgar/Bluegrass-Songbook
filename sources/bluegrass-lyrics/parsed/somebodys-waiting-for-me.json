  "raw_lyrics": "In a noisy eastern city sat a lonely lad one night\nIn a bar room where the wine began to flow\nFrom a table in the corner the young man slowly rised\nAnd he said it\u2019s getting late boys I must go\n\nFor somebody\u2019s waiting for me\nSomeone who loves me I know\nThere\u2019s a light shining bright in the window\nFor somebody\u2019s waiting for me\n\nI suppose you have a sweetheart his companions jovially said\nIf she\u2019s pretty we would like to see her too\nIf you\u2019ll only stop your teasing I will show her to you boys\nShe\u2019s the only sweetheart that I ever knew\n\nFrom an old brown leather pocketbook a picture he did take\nOf a gray-haired lady with a bowed-down head\nShe\u2019s my mother and my sweetheart and she waits for me tonight\nSo you see I told the truth boys when I said",
