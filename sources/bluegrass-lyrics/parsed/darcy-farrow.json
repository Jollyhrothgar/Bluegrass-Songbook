  "raw_lyrics": "Where the Walker runs down to the Carson Valley plain,\nThere lived a maiden, Darcy Farrow was her name\nThe daughter of old Dundee and fair was she\nAnd the sweetest flower that bloomed o\u2019er the range.\n\nHer voice was sweet as the sugar candy\nHer touch was as soft as a bed of goose down.\nHer eyes shone bright like the pretty lights\nThat shine in the night out of Yerrington town.\n\nShe was courted by young Vandermeer\nAnd quite handsome was he I am to hear\nHe brought her silver rings and lacy things\nAnd she promised to wed before the snows fell that year.\n\nBut her pony did stumble and she did fall.\nHer dyin\u2019 touched on the heart of us all.\nYoung Vandy in his pain put a bullet to his brain\nAnd we buried them together as the snows began to fall.\n\nThey sing of Darcy Farrow where the Truckee runs through\nThey sing of her beauty in Virginia City too.\nAt dusty Sundown to her name they drink a round\nAnd to young Vandy whose love was true.",
