  "raw_lyrics": "Why do you cry little darlin\nWhy are those tears in your eyes\nWhy do you weep little darlin\nJust when I say goodbye\n\nIt makes me sad and lonely\nTo see you feel so blue\nWhat have I done little darlin\nI have I been untrue to you\n\nCause you are called little darlin\nTo fight for your country true\nThere\u2019s many a poor girl just like me\nWeeping for their sweetheart too\n\nI\u2019ve tried so hard to be cheerful\nBut thought of all the long years\nYou might be gone little darlin\nI could not keep back my tears\n\nThat\u2019s why I cry little darlin\nBecause you\u2019re going away\nLeaving me all broken hearted\nTo weep for you day after day\n\nEvery night I\u2019ll kneel by my bedside\nAnd ask God to guide you each day\nBack to your sweetheart that\u2019s waiting\nAnd loves you more than I can say",
