  "raw_lyrics": "One evening getting dark, we first met at the park\nSitting by the fountain all alone;\nI lifted up my hat, and then began to chat\nShe said she\u2019d love to see me at her home\n\nSuch a star I\u2019ve never seen, she\u2019s as pretty as a queen\nShe\u2019s as perfect as an angel from above,\nIf she\u2019ll only be my wife, I\u2019ll live happy all my life\nWith that aggravating beauty, Lulu Walls\n\nIf she were only mine, I would build a house so fine\nAround it so many fences tall,\nIt would make me jealous free, that no one else but me\nCould gaze on that beauty, Lulu Walls\n\nOne evening getting late, I met her at the gate\nI asked her if she\u2019d wed me in the fall,\nShe only turned away, and nothing would she say\nThat aggravating beauty, Lulu Walls",
