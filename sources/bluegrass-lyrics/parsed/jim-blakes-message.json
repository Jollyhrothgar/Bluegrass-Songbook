  "raw_lyrics": "Jim Blake your wife is dying\nWent over the wires tonight\nThe message was brought to the depot\nBy a lad all trembling with fright\n\nHe entered the office crying\nHis face was terribly white\nSend this message to dad and his engine\nMother is dying tonight\n\nIn something less than an hour\nJim\u2019s message back to me flew\nTell wife I\u2019ll be there at midnight\nI\u2019m praying for her too\n\nI left my son in the office\nTook the message to Jim\u2019s wife\nThere I found the dying woman\nWas scarce of breath and life\n\nO\u2019er hill and dale and valley\nThunders the heavy train\nHis engine is sobbing and throbbing\nAnd under a terrible strain\n\nBut Jim hangs onto his throttle\nGuiding her crazy flight\nAnd his voice cries out in the darkness\nGod speed the express tonight\n\nI telephoned the doctor\nHow is Jim\u2019s wife I asked\nAbout the hour of midnight\nIs long as she can last\n\nIn something less than an hour\nThe train will be along\nBut here I have a message\nOh god there is something wrong\n\nThe message reads disaster\nThe train is in the ditch\nThe engineer is dying\nDerailed by an open switch\n\nAnd there is another message\nTo Jim\u2019s wife it is addressed\nI\u2019ll meet you at midnight in heaven\nWait for the fast express",
