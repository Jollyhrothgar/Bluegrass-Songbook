I\u2019ve got to know\n\nDress yourself in silk and satin, put some ribbons in your hair\nBut don\u2019t say you\u2019re gonna leave me, it\u2019s more than I can bear\nGo and have your night of dancing if you like those country songs\nBut when all the fun is over, Julianne, come on home\n\nJulianne, you know I love you, I can\u2019t live my life alone\nIs there some way I can please you, tell me what could keep you home\nI\u2019ve got no gold and silver, got no diamonds for your hand\nAll I have is love, this love I\u2019ll give you Oh, I need you, Julianne",
