  "raw_lyrics": "Thinking of you while out for a ramble\nDown by a cold frosty stream\nSet down on a bed of hemlocks and primroses\nAnd gently I fell into a dream\n\nI dreamed I saw a pretty fair maiden\nSuch beauty I\u2019d never saw before\nHer dress was bound round with hemlocks and primroses\nSo green was the mantel she wore\n\nHer hair was of a dark brown color\nHer teeth was as ivory so white\nHer eyes they shined like sparking diamonds\nOr stars than shine on a cold frosty night\n\nI drew her near then I awakened\nWith two empty arms and you on my mind\nHeaven seemed so near while I was dreaming\nIt hurts to know you left me behind",
