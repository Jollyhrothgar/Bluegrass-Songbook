  "raw_lyrics": "I was born in Dixie in a boomer shack\nJust a little shanty by the railroad track\nThe humming of the driver was my lullaby\nAnd a freight train whistle taught me how to cry\n\nI got the freight train blues Lawdy Lawdy\nGot them in the bottom of my rambling shoes\nAnd when the whistle blows I gotta Oh Lawdy\nGuess I\u2019m never gonna lose the freight train blues\n\nMy daddy was a fireman and my mammy dear\nWas the only daughter of the engineer\nMy sweetie is a brakeman and that ain\u2019t no joke\nIt\u2019s a shame the way she keeps a good man broke\n\nAeroplanes and autos always leave me cold\nThe moaning of a steamboat never stirs my soul\nThe only thing that makes me want to navigate\nIs a wildcat whistle on a south bound freight\n\nI know I\u2019m old enough to quit this running round\nI\u2019ve tried a hundred times to stop and settle down\nBut every time I find a place I\u2019d like to stay\nI hear a freight train holler and I\u2019m on my way",
