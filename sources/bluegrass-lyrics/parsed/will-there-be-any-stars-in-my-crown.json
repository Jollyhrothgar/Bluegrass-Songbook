  "raw_lyrics": "I am thinking today of that beautiful land\nI shall reach when the sun goeth down\nWhen through wonderful grace by my Savior I stand\nWill there be any stars in my crown\n\nWill there be any stars, any stars in my crown\nWhen at evening the sun goeth down\nWhen I wake with the blest in those mansions of rest\nWill there be any stars in my crown\n\nIn the strength of the Lord let me labor and pray\nLet me watch as a winner of souls\nThat bright stars may be mine in the glorious day\nWhen His praise like the sea billow rolls\n\nO what joy it will be when His face I behold\nLiving gems at His feet to lay down\nIt would sweeten my bliss in the city of gold\nShould there be any stars in my crown",
