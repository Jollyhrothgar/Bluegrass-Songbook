  "raw_lyrics": "In scarlet Town where I was born\nThere was a fair maid dwelling\nMade many a youth cry well a day\nHer name was Barbara Allen\n\nIt was in the merry month of May\nWhen green buds they were swelling\nSweet William came from the west country\nAnd he courted Barbara Allen\n\nHe sent his servant unto her\nTo the place where she was dwelling\nSaid my master\u2019s sick, bids me call for you\nIf your name be Barbara Allen\n\nWell, slowly, slowly got she up\nAnd slowly went she nigh him\nBut all she said as she passed his bed\nYoung man I think you\u2019re dying\n\nThen lightly tripped she down the stairs\nShe heard those church bells tolling\nAnd each bell seemed to say as it tolled\nHard hearted Barbara Allen\n\nO, mother, mother go make my bed\nAnd make it long and narrow\nSweet William died for me today\nI\u2019ll die for him tomorrow\n\nThey buried Barbara in the old church yard\nThey buried Sweet William beside her\nOut of his grave grew a red, red rose\nAnd out of hers a briar\n\nThey grew and grew up the old church wall\nTill they could grow no higher\nAnd at the top twined a lover\u2019s knot\nThe red rose and the briar",
