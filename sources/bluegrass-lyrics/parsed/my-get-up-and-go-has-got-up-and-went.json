  "raw_lyrics": "How do I know my youth is all spent?\nMy get up and go has got up and went\nIn spite of it all, I\u2019m able to grin\nWhen I think of the places my get up has been\n\nOld age is golden, I think I\u2019ve heard said\nBut sometimes I wonder as I crawl into bed\nMy ears in a drawer, my teeth in a cup\nMy eyes on the table until I wake up\n\nAs sleep dims my vision, I say to myself\nIs there anything else I should lay on the shelf?\nBut nations are warring and business is vexed\nSo I\u2019ll stick around to see what happens next\n\nWhen I was younger, my slippers were red\nI could kick up my heels right over my head\nWhen I was older my slippers were blue\nBut still I could dance the whole night thru\n\nNow I am old, my slippers are black\nI huff to the store and I puff my way back\nBut never you laugh, I don\u2019t mind at all\nI\u2019d rather be huffing than not puff at all\n\nI get up each morning and dust off my wits\nOpen the paper and read the obits\nIf I\u2019m not there, I know I\u2019m not dead\nSo I eat a good breakfast and go back to bed",
