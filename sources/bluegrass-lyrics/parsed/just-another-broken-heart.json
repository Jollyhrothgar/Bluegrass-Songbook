  "raw_lyrics": "They stood on the beach one evening\nOut in the moonlight fair\nTwas a boy in the pride of manhood\nAnd a girl in beauty rare\n\nI never had thought that you loved me\nAn innocent look of surprise\nCrept out from beneath her lashes\nAnd into those deep brown eyes\nOh sir I was only flirting\nOnly a playing a part\nJust another boy\u2019s life ruined\nJust another broken heart\n\nSir I\u2019m to be married this winter\nFarewell and she gave me her hand\nAnd drawing a robe around her\nShe left me alone on the sand\n\nHe goes with a crowd of passers\nAlways bitter and cold\nJust another boy grown weary\nJust another boy grown old\n\nThere\u2019s a rose grows in your garden\nWhite rose is the symbol of peace\nAnd when I am dead little darling\nPlant that rose at my head and my feet\n\nOh sir I was only flirting\nOnly a playing a part\nJust another boy\u2019s life ruined\nJust another broken heart",
