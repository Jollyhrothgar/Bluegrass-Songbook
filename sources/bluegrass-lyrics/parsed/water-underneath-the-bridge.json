  "raw_lyrics": "You came to me and said that you were wrong\nFor leaving me and staying gone so long\nYou came to me with open arms saying you were home\nIn my mind I can\u2019t forgive you in my heart I\u2019m all alone\n\nYou say you want to come back\nTo our home upon the ridge\nThere\u2019s too much water underneath the bridge\n\nA home and a family left behind\nTwo little children crying all the time\nAll the things that we worked for didn\u2019t mean that much to you\nSo how can I forgive you for what you\u2019ve put me through\n\nYou say you want to come back\nTo our home upon the ridge\nThere\u2019s too much water underneath the bridge\n\nThe day you left I walked on down the road\nThe sky was gray and cloudy and the water looked so cold\nAt the crossing by the river, thought I\u2019d take the easy way\nThen I realized there\u2019s people here that needed me to stay\n\nSo I walked back up the hill\nTo our home upon the ridge\nThere\u2019s too much water underneath the bridge",
