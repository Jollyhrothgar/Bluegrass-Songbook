  "raw_lyrics": "My sweetheart is a shy little miss\nAnd one I fondly adore\nAnd when you ask her for a kiss\nShe\u2019ll give you just one and no more\n\nShe\u2019ll give you just one and no more\nShe\u2019ll give you just one and no more\nAnd when you ask her for a kiss\nShe\u2019ll give you just one and no more\n\nHer dad was feelin old man\nHe always had a feelin for me\nI can tell you when this feelin began\nWhen his daughter I first went to see\nI was bidding my sweetheart good night\nIn the usual manner you know\nWhen a voice from the house said stick him towse ?\nAnd give him one more as he goes\n\nAnd give him one more as he goes\nAnd give him one more as he goes\nWhen a voice from the house said stick him towse ?\nAnd give him one more as he goes\nIt was over the garden wall in a manner I\u2019ll tell you not slow\nHe exclaimed with a swear and his foot smote the air\nAnd I\u2019ll give him one more as he goes\n\nAnd I\u2019ll give him one more as he goes\nAnd I\u2019ll give him one more as he goes\nHe exclaimed with a swear and his foot smote the air\nAnd I\u2019ll give him one more as he goes",
