  "raw_lyrics": "I once loved a beautiful maiden\nAs fair as the blue skies above\nAnd each night as we wondered together\nThe moon seemed to smile on our love\n\nWe vowed to be true to each other\nAnd nothing could cause us to part\nBut we never once dreamed that the future\nHeld only a broken heart\n\nThen there came the night when we parted\nWe quarreled as all sweethearts do\nAnd I learned what it was to be jealous\nWhen she told me our love was untrue\n\nShe told me she had always been faithful\nShe swore that her love could not die\nAnd then when I did not believe her\nShe kissed me and told me goodbye\n\nYodel\n\nI found I had falsely accused her\nAnd went back to make her my bride\nAnd there in the door stood her mother\nShe told me my sweetheart had died\n\nI went in and knelt down beside her\nAnd there in the hush of that room\nI prayed that my maker would take me\nAnd send my soul down to its doom\n\nSo now I have told you the reason\nThere\u2019s always a tear in my eye\nFor long weary years I\u2019ve repented\nBut I\u2019m longing to lay down and die\n\nAnd I wonder if I\u2019ll be forgiven\nWhen I face the master someday\nAnd I wonder if I\u2019ll see my sweetheart\nOn that beautiful shore far away",
