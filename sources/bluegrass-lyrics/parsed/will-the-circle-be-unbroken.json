  "raw_lyrics": "I was standing by the window\nOn a cold and cloudy day\nWhen I saw the hearse come rolling\nTo carry my mother away\n\nWill the circle be unbroken\nBye and bye Lord bye and bye\nThere\u2019s a better home a waiting\nIn the sky Lord in the sky\n\nI said to the undertaker\nUndertaker please drive slow\nFor that body you are carrying\nLord I hate to see her go\n\nWell I followed close behind her\nTried to hold up and be brave\nBut I could not hide my sorrow\nWhen they laid her in that grave\n\nI went back home Lord that home was lonesome\nSince my mother, she was gone\nAll my brothers and sisters crying\nWhat a home so sad and alone",
