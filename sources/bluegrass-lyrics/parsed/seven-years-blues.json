  "raw_lyrics": "Just seven years ago today\nWas when you said good-bye\nIt broke my heart to see you go\nAnd yet I could not cry\n\nYou kissed me sweet and said good-bye\nBut I could not believe\nThat you would ever make me cry\nUnwanted and to grieve\n\nThe sun is slowly sinking down\nTo make the close of day\nTo make the end of seven years\nThe ending of my way\n\nI had no one to stand by me\nTo count these bitter tears\nI could never live these awful blues\nAnother seven years\n\nI had waited seven years today\nTo see your face once more\nAnd if my life could be as long\nI\u2019d wait ten thousand more",
