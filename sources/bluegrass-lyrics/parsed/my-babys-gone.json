  "raw_lyrics": "Hold back the rushing minutes make the wind lie still\nDon\u2019t let the moonlight shine across the lonely hill\nDry all the raindrops and hold back the sun\nMy world has ended my baby\u2019s gone\n\nThe milkman whistles softly as he comes up to my door\nThe mailman brings the letters by just like he did before\nThey seem so busy all day long as though there\u2019s nothing wrong\nDon\u2019t they know the world has ended? My baby\u2019s gone\n\nI wake up sometimes in the night and realize you\u2019re gone\nAnd then I toss upon my bed and wait for day to come\nI try to tell my lonely heart it must go on alone\nBut it cries the world has ended, my baby\u2019s gone",
