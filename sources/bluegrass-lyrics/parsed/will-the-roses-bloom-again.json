  "raw_lyrics": "\u2018Neath the shadow in the meadow\nLillies lie on every side\nBy the river flowers shudder\nFading dying in their prime\n\nLovers parting lonely crying\nSadly strolling down the lane\nSomeone saying I must leave you\nTil the roses bloom again\n\nWhen the roses bloom again\nWhen the roses bloom again\nI will meet you I will greet you\nWhen the roses bloom again\n\nSunshine\u2019s over crimson clover\nBlooming in the meadow bright\nSummer fingers softly lingers\nWhispering softly in the night\n\nSomeone roaming in the gloaming\nStrolling sadly down the lane\nFor that promise she would cherish\nTil the roses bloom again\n\nShe was faithful to her lover\nShe was true until the end\nThough she knew not what befell him\nStill she hopes they\u2019ll meet again",
