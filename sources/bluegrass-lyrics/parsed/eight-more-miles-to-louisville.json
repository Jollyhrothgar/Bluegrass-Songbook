  "raw_lyrics": "I\u2019ve traveled o\u2019er this country wide seeking fortune fair\nUp and  down the two coast lines I\u2019ve traveled everywhere\nFrom Portland East to Portland West back along the line\nI\u2019m going now to the place that\u2019s best that old hometown of mine\n\nEight more miles and Louisville will come into my view\nEight more miles on this old road and I\u2019ll never more be blue\nI knew some day that I\u2019d come back I knew it from the start\nEight more miles to Louisville the hometown of my heart\n\nThere\u2019s bound to be a gal somewhere that you like best of all\nMine lives down in Louisville she\u2019s long and she is tall\nBut she\u2019s the kind that you can\u2019t find a traveling through the land\nI\u2019m on my way this very day to win her heart and hand\n\nNow I can picture in my mind a place we\u2019ll call our home\nA humble little hut for two we\u2019ll never want to roam\nThe place that\u2019s right for that love sight is in those bluegrass hills\nWhere gently flows the Ohio by a place called Louisville",
