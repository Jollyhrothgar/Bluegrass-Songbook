  "raw_lyrics": "Who\u2019s that knocking at my window\nKnocks so loud and won\u2019t come in\nIt is your own true-hearted lover\nRise you up and let him in\n\nAwake, awake, don\u2019t wake my mother\nOur love\u2019s a thing she can\u2019t endure\nShe\u2019s been the ruin of many a lover\nShe\u2019ll be the ruin of many more\n\nAwake, awake, don\u2019t wake my father\nFor he is on his bed of rest\nAnd on his breast he carries a weapon\nTo kill the one that I love best\n\nI wish I was a little sparrow\nI\u2019d circle like a turtledove\nI\u2019d fly away to a lonely valley\nAnd settle down in the land of love",
