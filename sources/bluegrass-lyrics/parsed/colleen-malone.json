  "raw_lyrics": "It\u2019s been ten years and three since I first went to sea\nSince I sailed from old Ireland and home\nBut those hills lush and green were a part of my dreams\nWhen I dreamed of my Colleen Malone\n\nOn the day I returned to my sorrow I learned\nThat the angels had called her away\nTo a grave on a hill overlooking the mill\nThat\u2019s the place where she\u2019s sleeping today\n\nAs the soft breezes blow through the meadow I go\nPast the mill with the moss covered stone\nUp the pathway I climb through the woods and the vines\nTo be with my Colleen Malone\n\nShe was faithful each day as I sailed far away\nThere was no one but me that she loved\nI remember those eyes soft and blue as the skies\nAnd her heart was as pure as a dove\n\nAll the years of my life I will not take a wife\nI will live in this valley above\nPlanting flowers around in this soft gentle ground\nThat is holding my Colleen Malone",
