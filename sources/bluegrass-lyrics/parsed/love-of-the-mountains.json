  "raw_lyrics": "Two trees on a hillside of the mountain\nAlways looking up towards the sky\nRemind me of my papa and my mama\nWho lived there eighty years before they died\n\nNow a bright moon is shining in the valley\nAn old wagon leans against a stack of hay\nTwo graves on a hillside by the cabin\nMy mom and dad are resting there today\n\nThe burning of the green wood on the fireplace\nThe fallen snow around the red bud trees\nThe branches of the laurel by the creek bed\nAnd the rippling waters of the gentle stream\n\nPapa used to talk about the young days\nWhen he and mama first were settled there\nHe spoke about the love of the mountains\nThat he and mama shared together there",
