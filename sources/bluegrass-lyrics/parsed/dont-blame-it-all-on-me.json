  "raw_lyrics": "If our love should fade like a cold winter day\nDon\u2019t blame it all on me\nTheir true love has flown I have known friends will say\nDon\u2019t blame it all on me\n\nThere was a time dear when we were so gay\nI heard you say love only you\nBut some day with the dawn all our love may be gone\nDon\u2019t blame it all on me\n\nNow you left and know all our love is so wrong\nDon\u2019t blame it all on me\nFor there was a time when our love was a song\nDon\u2019t blame it all on me\n\nFor after all dear I too have a heart\nYou have it now don\u2019t break it apart\nSomeday our romance may break up just by chance\nBut don\u2019t blame it all on me\n\nYou just can\u2019t go on with no smile in your heart\nDon\u2019t blame it all on me\nOur friends they all say that we too soon must part\nDon\u2019t blame it all on me\n\nNow if you\u2019ll change dear I will change too\nAnd maybe then we\u2019ll find love anew\nSomeday with the dawn all our love may be gone\nBut don\u2019t blame it all on me",
