  "raw_lyrics": "I see you there at the Brass Rail Bar\nSomebody just asked you what sign you are\nAnd I see you\u2019re thinkin\u2019 you maybe should\u2019ve stayed home\nBut you\u2019re tired of being alive and alone\n\nIn your brand new hairdo, you look real fine\nI hear you toast yourself, today you\u2019re twenty-nine\nAnd you\u2019re riding on what the future brings\nAn honest man who wants the simple things.\n\nThere\u2019s Tiffany lamps here to brighten up the gloom\nThe conversation sounds like a locker room\nWhere will you find love, you\u2019re living in a tiny world\nAnd at the office they call you an old fashioned girl\n\nYou sit so silent, sipping at a beer\nCatching your reflection in a tinted mirror\nAnd you shopped all day for that brand new dress\nWhat a price to pay, for settling for less\n\nI see you there at the Brass Rail Bar\nSomebody just asked you what sign you are\nAnd I see you\u2019re wishin\u2019 you woulda just stayed home\nBut you\u2019re tired of being alive and alone\n\nAlive and alone     Alive and alone\nAlive and alone     Alive and alone",
