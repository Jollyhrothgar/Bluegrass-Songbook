  "raw_lyrics": "You tied a love knot in my heart dear\nWhen you said you\u2019d be my bride\nOh how well I remember\nAs we strolled side by side\n\nLeaves were falling all around us\nRoses withered on the ground\nYou tied a love knot in my heart dear\nThat can never be unwound\n\nThe only thing that I have left now\nIs this little string I\u2019ve found\nWith a little love knot in it\nThat she held tight in her hand\n\nAs I stood there by your bedside\nAs I looked into your eyes\nYou tied a love knot in my heart dear\nThat can never be untied\n\nThere\u2019s a heart tonight that\u2019s lonely\nThere\u2019s a heart tonight that\u2019s sad\nFor God has took you from me\nThe best pal I ever had\n\nShe\u2019s gone to sing up in heaven\nGod needed her there by His side\nYou tied a love knot in my heart dear\nThat can never be untied",
