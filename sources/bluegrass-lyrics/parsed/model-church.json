  "raw_lyrics": "Dear wife I found a model church\nAnd worshipped there today\nIt made me think of the good old times\nBefore my hair was gray\n\nThe meetinghouse was finer built\nThan they were years ago\nBut I found out when I went in\nIt was not built for show\n\nThe sexton did not sit me down\nAway back by the door\nHe knew that I was old and deaf\nAnd saw that I was poor\n\nHe must have been a Christian man\nHe led me boldly through\nThe long aisle of that crowded church\nTo find a pleasant pew\n\nI wish you\u2019d heard the singing, wife\nit had the old town ring\nThe preacher said with trumpet voice\nLet all the people sing\n\nOh Coronation was the tune\nThe music upward roared\nI thought I heard the angel choir\nStrike on their harps of gold\n\nI tell you wife it did me good\nTo sing those hymns once more\nI felt just like some wrecked marine\nWho gets a glimpse of shore\n\nIt made want to lay aside\nThis weather beaten form\nAnd anchor in that blessed port\nForever from the storm\n\nDear wife the toil will soon be o\u2019er\nThe victory soon be won\nThe shining strand is just ahead\nOur race is nearly run\n\nWe\u2019re near to Canaan\u2019s happy shore\nOur hopes are bright and fair\nThank God we\u2019ll never sin again\nThere\u2019ll be no sorrow there\n\nThere\u2019ll be no sorrow there\nIn heaven above\nWhere all is love\nThere\u2019ll be no sorrow there",
