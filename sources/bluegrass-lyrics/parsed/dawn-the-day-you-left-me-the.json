  "raw_lyrics": "So early on that morning, the moon still way up high\nThe moon still way up high\nThough soon enough the sun would warm the colors of the sky\nI lay awake I could not sleep or even close my eyes\nAnd dear you seemed so restless too I should have realized\n\nThe house was dark the moonlight was inviting and so strange\nI went out by the window to watch the morning change\nAnd just before the break of dawn and bird began to sing\nAnd somehow then it came to me just what the day would bring\n\nThat dawn the day you left me was so beautiful and sad\nHow could I have turned away from the troubles that we had\nI know you tried to make me see and no I never would\nToo late that dawn the day you left I finally understood\n\nA stray old cat did walk the fence outside my window bed\nHe stopped and looked my way and then he went without a care\nAnd I wondered when he\u2019d ramble back or why he ever should\nBut I knew that he was just like you and that he never would\n\nThat dawn the day you left me was so beautiful and sad\nHow could I have turned away from the troubles that we had\nThose words you spoke now ring so true just like you said they would\nToo late that dawn the day you left I finally understood",
