Hoo-hooo-ooooo.\n\nNow my sweet baby\u2019s on that train\nMy sweet baby\u2019s on that train\nI wonder if I will see her again\nBut that last train\u2019s done gone down.  Hoo-hooo-ooooo.\n\nNow the whistle\u2019s moaning low\nThe whistle is moaning low\nI begged my baby please don\u2019t go\nBut that last train\u2019s done gone down.  Hoo-hooo-ooooo.\n\nNow I\u2019m sorry for what I\u2019ve done\nI\u2019m sorry for what I\u2019ve done\nTo leave behind your baby crying\nBut that last train\u2019s done gone down.  Hoo-hooo-ooooo.\n\nWell that last train done left town\nThe last train done left town\nI heard the whistle moaning low\nBut that last train done left town.  Hoo-hooo-hooo-hoo-hoo.",
