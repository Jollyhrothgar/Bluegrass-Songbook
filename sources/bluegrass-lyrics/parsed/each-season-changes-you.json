  "raw_lyrics": "It was springtime when I found you like a flower\nAnd our love grew warmer with the summer sun\nIn the fall I soon could see your love was changing\nBroke my heart to see what wintertime had done\n\nLike the weather your heart changes with each season\nSpringtime, summer, fall, and winter too\nThough I know I\u2019ll never understand the reason\nI still wonder why each season changes you\n\nCome spring, you said that you were sorry\nAnd the summer brought a golden memory\nIn the fall again, I saw your love was changing\nAnd the winter brought the same old misery",
