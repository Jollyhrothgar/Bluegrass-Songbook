  "raw_lyrics": "My father, he\u2019s the king of the gypsies, it is true\nMy mother, she learned me some camping for to do\nWith my pack all on my back my friends all wished me well\nAs I went down to London town some fortunes for to tell\nSome fortunes for to tell, some fortunes for to tell\nAs I went down to London town some fortunes for to tell\n\nAs I was a-walking upon a London street\nA handsome young squire was the first I chanced to meet\nHe view-ed my brown cheeks and he liked them so well\nHe said, \u201cMy little gypsy girl, will you my fortune tell?\u201d\nSome fortunes for to tell, some fortunes for to tell\nAs I went down to London town some fortunes for to tell\n\nOh yes sir, oh kind sir, please give to me your hand\nIt\u2019s you that have fine fortune, both houses and good land\nThe fairer girls are dainty, but you must cast them by\nFor it is the little gypsy girl who is to be your bride\nSome fortunes for to tell, some fortunes for to tell\nAs I went down to London town some fortunes for to tell\n\nHe took me to his castle, there were carpets on the floor\nAnd servants there a-awaiting for to open every door\nThere were ladies there of honor and the music it did play\nAnd all were there to celebrate the gypsy\u2019s wedding day\nSome fortunes for to tell, some fortunes for to tell\nAs I went down to London town some fortunes for to tell\n\nSo it\u2019s farewell to the gypsy life, to camping on the green\nNo more with my brothers and my sisters I\u2019ll be seen\nOh, once I was a gypsy girl but now I\u2019m a squire\u2019s bride\nWith servants for to wait on me and in my carriage ride\nSome fortunes for to tell, some fortunes for to tell\nAs I went down to London town some fortunes for to tell",
