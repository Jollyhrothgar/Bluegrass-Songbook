  "raw_lyrics": "There\u2019s a store by the road in the country\nAmong the hills where the evergreens grow\nIn that store by the road there\u2019s a woman\nWho is different from others I know\n\nNow her irony-gray hair\u2019s turned to silver\nAnd her kind eyes are ever soft and blue\nAlways she has a kind word for others\nAnd a smile ever waiting for you\n\nShe\u2019s adored for her sunny disposition\nBy the women, the children and men\nIn all the neighboring hills they call her Mother\nFor she\u2019s really a mother dear to them\n\nShe is cheerful like the birds in the cedars\nShe is modest like the songs that they sing\nIn the hills nearby they call her Mother\nFor she\u2019s really a mother true to them\n\nWhen the clouds hang low on the mountain\nAnd the pines are bent low by the snow\nNeighbors go to that store by the roadside\nIt\u2019s a place that they all love to go\n\nSome go there to play cards at the table\nSome just sit by the warm, cheering fire\nAnd dear Mother with kind disposition\nFinds a way to make all happy there\n\nShe\u2019s adored for her sunny disposition\nBy the women, the children and the men\nIn all the neighboring hills they call her Mother\nFor she\u2019s really a mother dear to them",
