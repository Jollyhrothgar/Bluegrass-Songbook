  "raw_lyrics": "She went back to Wichita\nShe went back to her ma and pa\nReckon I saw her next to my truck\nPumping gas with the car packed up.\n\nWe talked as neighbors will\nThere waiting for the tanks to fill\nWe talked about nothing\nhow it might snow\nHow far she had to go.\n\nGoing back where the grass grows tall\nAnd the fields burn in the fall\nYou can still hear the night birds call\nBack in Wichita.\n\nShe came in \u201985\nShe came here as a July bride\nBut it never got easy\nnever got rich\nAin\u2019t got much but what she came here with.\n\nGood times have all been spent\nShe ain\u2019t broken but she\u2019s badly bent\nThere\u2019s nothing she wants here\nnothing that shines\nShe\u2019s made up her mind.\n\nShe says for all my time\nwell I ain\u2019t got much to show\nYou can tell that man of mine and anyone who wants to know\n\nGoing back where the grass grows tall\nAnd the fields burn in the fall\nYou can still hear the night birds call\nBack in Wichita.",
