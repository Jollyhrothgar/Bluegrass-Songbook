  "raw_lyrics": "Down by the waterfall\nWhere the waters run so cool\nThere no secrets ever fall\nFrom the lips of the fool\n\nJeniffer was seventeen the same age as I\nShe had lived next door to us since we were five\nShe knew I loved her dearly, I told her many times\nAnd I looked forward to the day that she would be all mine\n\nOne more year of school we thought, then wedding bells would ring\nBut the hand of fate has ways of changing everything\nI walked upon the two of them down by the waterfall\nJeniffer and Jimmy Jones they saw me not at all\n\nJimmy Jones was married and had a family\nAnd I just couldn\u2019t understand why they did this to me\nBoth were scared but all they thought I\u2019d do was tell his wife\nTheir faces turned to masks of fear before I took their life\n\nPeople thought that Jeniffer just up and ran away\nJimmy Jones who disappeared is a mystery today\nMany years has passed but bitterly I still recall\nAnd only I alone know what\u2019s behind the waterfall",
