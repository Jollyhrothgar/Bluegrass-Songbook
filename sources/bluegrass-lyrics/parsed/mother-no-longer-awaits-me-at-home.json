  "raw_lyrics": "One night while the moon from heaven was shining\nMy mother was praying for me to come home\nShe asked her dear lord watch o\u2019er me out yonder\nTo send me back home to never more roam\n\nWhen I left my old home way back in the mountains\nI said I\u2019d return with honor and fame\nBut a young reckless heart turned wrong at the crossroads\nNow as I go home I bring mother shame\n\nWhen I got to the place where I spent my childhood\nThe silvery moon was shining so bright\nWhen I asked my dear friends to tell me of mother\nThey said she was called to heaven last night\n\nShe told them of how she was longing to see me\nHow lonely her home since I went away\nSaid darling repent and ask for forgiveness\nAnd meet mother there in heaven some day\n\nMother has gone to live with the angels\nHer soul is at rest around the great throne\nNow I have no one left here to advise me\nFor mother no longer awaits me at home",
