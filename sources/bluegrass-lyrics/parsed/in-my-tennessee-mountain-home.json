  "raw_lyrics": "Sittin\u2019 on the front porch on a summer afternoon\nIn a straight back chair on two legs, leaned against the wall\nWatch the kids a-playin\u2019 with June bugs on a string\nAnd chase the glowin\u2019 fireflies when evening shadows fall.\n\nIn my Tennessee mountain home, life is peaceful as a baby\u2019s sigh\nIn my Tennessee mountain home, crickets sing in the fields nearby.\n\nHoneysuckle vine clings to the fence upon the lane\nTheir fragrance makes the summer wind so sweet\nAnd on a distant hilltop an eagle spreads its wings\nAnd a songbird on a fencepost sings a melody\n\nWalking home from church on sunday with the one you love\nJust laughin\u2019, talkin\u2019, making future plans\nAnd when the folks aren\u2019t looking you might steal a kiss or two\nSittin\u2019 in the porch swing holdin\u2019 hands.",
