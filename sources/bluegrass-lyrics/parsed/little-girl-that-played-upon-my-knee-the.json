  "raw_lyrics": "Many years have passed away and gone\nSince I left my old native home\nSince I left the scenes of my childhood there\nWhere the dark days seem to roam\n\nI left my aged father there\nAnd my mother so dear unto me\nI left a brother and a sister fair\nAnd a little girl that played upon my knee\n\nDon\u2019t Ginny remember, will she ever forget\nThose many hours of pleasure to me\nDoes she sigh when she thinks of those many happy hours\nWhen a little girl she played upon my knee\n\nI am homeward bound with the thrills of joy\nOf my wandering so far o\u2019er the sea\nI shall soon see my home, my old native home\nAnd the little girl that played upon my knee\n\nI am tired of life, I cannot live\nIn this dark world so weary unto me\nCome bury me low by the one I love so well\nBy the little girl that played upon my knee",
