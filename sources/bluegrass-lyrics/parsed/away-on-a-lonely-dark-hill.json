  "raw_lyrics": "One day on a bright April morning\nAs the sun stretched over the sky\nStood a man with his hands tied behind him\nAwaiting his sentence to die\n\nThe birds hushed their singing at daybreak\nFor Christ had his place to fulfill\nFrom a lovely bright mansion in Heaven\nTo away on a lonely dark hill\n\nThey made him walk that Calvary\nHe had to drink the bitter cup\nOne could hear hammers ring in the stillness\nThen the soldiers they lifted him up",
