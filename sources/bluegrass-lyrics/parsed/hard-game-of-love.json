  "raw_lyrics": "In the hard game of love I\u2019m the last one to fall\nBut I gave it my heart and I gave it my all\nI didn\u2019t know that she played a game with no rules\nSo I climbed aboard the old ship of fools\n\nAnd it\u2019s a lonesome old world, my sweetheart is gone\nI can\u2019t sleep at all. And I pray for the dawn\nIt\u2019s the last time I\u2019ll hurt, it\u2019s the last time I\u2019ll cry\nWhen I lay down tonight, gonna lay down and die\n\nIn the still of the night as the lonesome wind blows\nMy sanity wanes; it comes and it goes\nI feel like a child in a house all alone\nWhose mother and dad will never come home",
