  "raw_lyrics": "A house not a home was the picture Satan painted\nFor sweet little sister and me\nOur daddy would frown while mother was praying\nHis heart was so hardened that he would not believe\n\nIn anger he\u2019d swear his voice cold and loud\nHis Sundays were spent out with the gambling crowd\nI\u2019ve never seen my daddy inside a house of God\nFor Satan held his hand down the path of sin he trod\n\nNot long ago our circle was broken\nWhen God called on mother one night\nIn a voice sweet and low her last words were spoken\nAsking our daddy to raise her children right\n\nThe angels rejoiced in heaven last night\nI heard my daddy praying til God made it right\nHe was smiling and singing with tears in his eyes\nWhile mother with the angels rejoiced last night",
