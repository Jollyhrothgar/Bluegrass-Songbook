  "raw_lyrics": "Far away from friends and loved ones\nMidst the storm a soldier lay\nGathered \u2019round him all his buddies\nRaised his head we heard him say\n\nThere\u2019s a lamp light in the window\nWhere an angel from above\nGently rocked my baby cradle\nWith such tender care and love\n\nMother dearest darlin\u2019 mother\nIt would ease this awful pain\nIf she\u2019d sing until I\u2019m sleeping\nRock my cradle once again\n\nNeath the palms tonight he\u2019s sleeping\nOn an island far away\nThough the years pass on in sorrow\nI still recall his words today",
