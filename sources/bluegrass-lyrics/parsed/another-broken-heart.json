  "raw_lyrics": "They stood on the beach one evening\nOut in the moonlight so fair\nWas a boy in the prime of manhood\nAnd a girl of beauty rare\n\nOh I never thought that you loved me\nAn innocent look of surprise\nCame out from beneath her lashes\nAnd into her deep brown eyes\n\nOh sir I was only flirting\nOnly a playing a part\nJust another boy\u2019s life ruined\nJust another broken heart\n\nSir, I\u2019m to be married this winter\nFarewell as she gave me her hand\nAnd throwing a robe around her\nShe left me alone on the sand\n\nNow he goes where the crowd all passes\nAlways so bitter and cold\nJust another boy\u2019s life ruined\nJust another boy grown old\n\nThere\u2019s a rose grows in your garden\nWhite roses the emblem of peace\nAnd when I am dead, little darlin\u2019\nPlant that rose at my head and my feet",
