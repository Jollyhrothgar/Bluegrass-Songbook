  "raw_lyrics": "While strolling alone in the country\nReviewing the scenes new and old\nI found an old fashioned log cabin\nSo beautiful there to behold\n\nA stranger was standing in silence\nHis eyes firmly fixed on the door\nMy heart ached in pity to see him\nFor these were the words that it bore\n\nIn the sign read an old log cabin for sale\nAn old oaken bucket and well\nEasy terms just keep a log on the fire each day\nAnd a light burning bright in the dell\n\nMany years an old couple so patiently looked\nFor a boy who\u2019s last promise did fail\nNow the old rockin\u2019 chairs will be rockin\u2019 no more\nThere\u2019s an old log cabin for sale\n\nHow long has it been since you\u2019ve written\nA letter to mother and dad\nHow long has it been since you\u2019ve seen them\nOh why don\u2019t you make their heart glad\n\nToo soon will the old home be vacant\nA candle light gleaming no more\nDon\u2019t wait \u2019til too late to remember\nThere may be a sign on the door\n\nMany years an old couple so patiently looked\nFor a boy who\u2019s last promise did fail\nNow the old rockin\u2019 chairs will be rockin\u2019 no more\nThere\u2019s an old log cabin for sale",
