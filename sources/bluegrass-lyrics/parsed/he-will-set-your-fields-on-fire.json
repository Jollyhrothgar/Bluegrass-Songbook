  "raw_lyrics": "There\u2019s a call that rings from the throne it springs\nTo those now gone astray\nSaying \u201cCome ye men from your load of sin\nThere at the altar lay\u201d\nMany do not heed that the chains of greed\nthat their conscience never tire\nBe assured my friend if you still offend\nHe will set your fields on fire\n\nNow if you don\u2019t from sin retire\nHe will set your fields on fire\nYou have heard Jesus\u2019 call\nAnd in death your soul must fall\nNow my friend if you desire\nYou may join the heavenly choir\nAnd rejoice with him free from every sin\nWhen He sets this world on fire\n\nYou have heard his voice seen His soul rejoice\nThat trusted in his grace\nYou have blushed with sin as He knocked within\nBut still you hide your face\nFrom the blessed Lord and His own true word\nBut still you say retire\nLeave the downward path kindle not His wrath\nOr He\u2019ll set your fields on fire",
