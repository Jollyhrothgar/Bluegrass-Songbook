  "raw_lyrics": "An old Jane about 49 came in to view the town\nShe registered up at Smith\u2019s Hotel as Miss Ada Brown\nShe said she was just 25 and that she was in love\nWith a young lad about 16, she called him her turtledove\n\nThe wedding day at last arrived, the birds did merrily sing\nHe touched her up for a hundred to go out and buy the ring\n\nHe never came back, no, he never came back\nHe\u2019s been gone for a year or more\nThat sassy young thing better have that ring\nWhen we meet on that beautiful shore\n\nI went down to a restaurant as hungry as a bear\nAnd a raving thief I did, I grabbed the bill of fare\nThe waiter said, now what for you, a piece of steak, I said\nHe taken my order and bowed his head and slowly walked away",
