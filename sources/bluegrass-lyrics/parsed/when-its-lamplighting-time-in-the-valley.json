  "raw_lyrics": "There\u2019s a lamp shining bright in a cabin\nIn the window it\u2019s shining for me\nAnd I know that my mother is praying\nFor the boy she is longing to see\n\nWhen it\u2019s lamp lighting time in the valley\nStill in dreams I go back to my home\nI can see that old lamp in the window\nIt will guide me wherever I roam.\n\nIn the lamplight tonight I can see her\nAs she rocks in her chair to and fro\nThough she prays that I\u2019ll come back to see her\nStill I know that I never can go.\n\nWhen it\u2019s lamp lighting time in the valley\nStill in dreams I go back to my home\nBut I\u2019ve sinned \u2018gainst my home and my loved ones\nAnd now i must ever more roam\n\nSo she lights up the lamp and sits waiting\nFor she knows not the crime i have done\nSo I\u2019ve  changed all my ways  and I\u2019ll meet her\nUp in heaven when life\u2019s race is run.\n\nWhen it\u2019s lamp lighting time in the valley\nStill in dreams I go back to my home\nOh I can see that old lamp in the window\nIt will guide me wherever I roam",
