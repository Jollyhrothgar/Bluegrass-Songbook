  "raw_lyrics": "Oh the waves on the sea how they roll\nAnd the chilly winds how they do blow\nMy own true love got drownded in the deep\nAnd the ship never got to the shore.\n\nI left my darling grievin\u2019\nI left my darling grievin\u2019\nI left my darling grievin\u2019 at the deep\nAnd I never expect to see her anymore.\n\nThe first on the deck was the captain of the ship\nA rough looking fellow was he\nSaid I care no more for my wife and my child\nThan I do for the fish in the sea.\n\nOne cold night as I lay on my bed\nI fell so fast asleep\nAnd thoughts of my true love come runnin\u2019 through my head\nAnd poor sailors that sail on the deep.\n\nOh the moon shines so bright and the stars give us light\nAnd my mother is waiting for me\nShe may look she may weep she may look to the deep\nShe may look to the bottom of the sea.\n\nThen three times around turned the gallant old ship\nYes three times around turned she\nAnd as she turned (the) third time around\nShe sank to the bottom of the sea.",
