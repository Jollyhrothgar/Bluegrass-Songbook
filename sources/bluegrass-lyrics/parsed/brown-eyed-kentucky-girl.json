  "raw_lyrics": "I traveled to Kentucky to court a fair young girl\nWhose eyes were of the darkest brown and her hair had a charming curl\nShe had the sweetest lips to kiss that I had ever found\nAnd she made me feel as if I was the only man around\n\nSome people think of horses when you talk of the Bluegrass State\nOthers think their bourbon is what makes it so great\nBut the reason that the Bluegrass State stands in my memory\nIs that brown eyed Kentucky girl she means so much to me\n\nI remember very clearly it was on a warm spring night\nWe declared we loved each other and to marry would be right\nIt was a short time later in the month of July\nOur lives were joined together we were one she and I\n\nMany years have come and gone since the day that we met\nOur love has grown much stronger and it is growing yet\nWe have a happy home and children we have three\nWe still enjoy each other this Kentucky girl and me",
