  "raw_lyrics": "It\u2019s not that love is dead and gone\nOr that you didn\u2019t try\nThat weight so heavy on my mind\nIt\u2019s the thought that you might mean it\nWhen you call me on the phone\nJust to tell me that you want me one more time\n\nI won\u2019t be standing at your door\nI stood there once before\nI\u2019ve known your hello and your good-bye\nSo why am I shaking like a child in the rain\nWhen you tell me that you want me one more time\nWhen you tell me that you want me one more time\n\nDon\u2019t talk about the midnights\nThat come down like a stone\nCan\u2019t you see that I already know\nAnd after all the morning sun\nWill burn away the dark\nBut even if you\u2019re there I\u2019ll be around\n\n* Refrain\n\nThere\u2019s part of me that laughs\nThere\u2019s part of me that cries\nThere\u2019s part of me that can\u2019t make up it\u2019s mind\nBut living would be easier\nIf you never call at all\nTo tell me that you want me one more time\n\n* Refrain",
