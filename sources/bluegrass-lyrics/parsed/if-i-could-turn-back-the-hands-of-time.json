  "raw_lyrics": "Well I packed up my old clothes and drove on down the road\nFour hunderd miles or more until I reached my next show.\nThe wind was blowing cold and brother don\u2019t you know\nThis pain inside my heart just won\u2019t let go.\n\nI never was one to follow a straight and narrow path\nBut I would now if it would lead me to my past.\nBack to her loving arms is where I want to go\nTo the one who left me out in the cold.\n\nIf I could turn back the hands of time\nTo the day when she was mine\nIf she\u2019d take me back right now\nI would walk the line\nIf I could turn back the hands of time.\n\nShe never wanted me to leave her all alone\nShe needed someone there to keep her warm at home\nHer words now are so clear in my mind\nIf I had only read between the lines.\n\nI\u2019ll play another smoke filled bar for tips in a jar\nAnother lonely night just me and my guitar\nBut if she would open up her heart to me again\nI\u2019d stop running down this road that has no end.",
