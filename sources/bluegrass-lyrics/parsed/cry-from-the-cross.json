  "raw_lyrics": "One morning in Jerusalem about the break of dawn\nA great trial was in session, they tried our blessed lord\nThey scorned him and they mocked him, they made him carry the cross\nOn top of Calvary mountain, they crucified my Lord\n\nOh the cry (Jesus cried) from the cross\nForgive him blessed father, he died upon the cross\nOh the cry (Jesus cried) from the cross\nThe son of God was dying, to save the world from loss\n\nSaint Peter he denied him at that awful trial at night\nHe said he never new him, it was an awful sight\nHe looked upon Saint Peter with eyes of perfect love\nSaint Peter\u2019s heart was broken, he prayed to God above\n\nCrying father it is finished then he bowed his head and died\nThe world was left in darkness, the graves were open wide\nAn earthquake shook Jerusalem the dead walked into town\nThe multitudes were frightened, God\u2019s wrath came pouring down",
