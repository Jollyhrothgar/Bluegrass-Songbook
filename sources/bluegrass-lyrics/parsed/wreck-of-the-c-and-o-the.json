  "raw_lyrics": "Along came the FFV, the fastest on the line,\nRunning along the C and O Road, twenty minutes behind the time\nRunning into Sewall Yard, was quartered on the line\nAwaiting their strict orders to bring her in on time\n\nAnd when she blew for Hinton, her engineer was there\nGeorge Alley was his name, with bright and wavy hair\nHis fireman, Jack Dickerson, was standing by his side\nReceiving their strict orders, and in the cab to ride\n\nGeorge Alley\u2019s mother came to him with a basket on her arm\nShe handed him a letter saying \u201cBe careful how you run\nFor many a man has lost his life trying to make up lost time\nBut if you run your engine right you\u2019ll get there just on time\u201d\n\nGeorge Alley said, \u201cDear mother, your letter I\u2019ll take heed\nI know my engine is all right and I know that she will speed\nSo o\u2019er this road I mean to run with speed unknown to all\nAnd when I blow for Clifton Forge, they\u2019ll surely hear my call\n\nGeorge Alley said to his fireman, \u201cJack, a little extra steam;\nI intend to run old Number 4 the fastest ever seen;\nSo o\u2019er this road I mean to fly like angels\u2019 wings unfurled,\nAnd when I blow for the Big Bend Tunnel, they\u2019ll surely hear my call\u201d\n\nGeorge Alley said to his fireman, \u201cJack, a rock ahead I see,\nAnd I know that death is lurking there for to grab both you and me\nSo from this cab, dear Jack do fly, your darling life to save\nFor I want you to be an engineer while I\u2019m sleeping in my grave\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no, dear George! That will not do, I want to die with you\u201d\n\u201cOh no, dear Jack, that will not be; I\u2019ll die for you and me\u201d\nSo from the cab poor Jack did leap, New River was running high,\nAnd he kissed his hand to George as Number 4 flew by\n\nSo up the road she dashed, against the rock she crashed\nThe engine turning upside down, and the coaches coming last\nGeorge Alley\u2019s head in the firebox lay, while the burning flames rolled high\n\u201cI\u2019m glad I was born an engineer, on the C and O road to die\u201d\n\nGeorge Alley\u2019s mother came to him and in sorrow she did sigh\nWhen she looked upon her darling boy and saw that he must die\n\u201cToo late, too late, dear mother! my doom is almost o\u2019er\nAnd I know that God will let me in when I reach that golden shore\u201d\n\nThe doctor said, \u201cDear George, O darling boy, be still\nYour life may yet be spared, if it is God\u2019s blessed will\u201d\n\u201cOh no, dear doc, that cannot be, I want to die so free\nI want to die on the engine I love, 143\u2033\n\nThe doctor said, \u201cDear George, your life cannot be saved\nMurdered upon a railroad, and laid in a lonesome grave\u201d\nHis face was covered up with blood, his eyes they could not see\nAnd the very last words that ever he spoke were, \u201cNearer my God to Thee\u201d",
