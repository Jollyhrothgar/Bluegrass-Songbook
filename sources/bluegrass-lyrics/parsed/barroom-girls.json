  "raw_lyrics": "Oh the night came undone like a party dress\nAnd fell at her feet in a beautiful mess\nThe smoke and the whiskey came home in her curls\nAnd they crept through the dreams of the barroom girls\n\nWell she tosses and turns because the sun is unkind\nAnd the heat of the day is coming in through the blinds\nBut leave all the blue skies for the rest of the world\nBecause the neon will shine for the barroom girls\n\nOh the barroom girls go by your side\nLike the ponies who pass on a carousel ride\nAnd all of the colors go \u2018round in a swirl\nWhen you dance in the arms of the barroom girls\n\nNow she rolls to her feet when she can\u2019t sleep no more\nAnd looks at her clothes lying out on the floor\nLast night\u2019s spangles and yesterday\u2019s pearls\nAre the bright morning stars of the barroom girls\n\nLast night\u2019s spangles and yesterday\u2019s pearls\nAre the bright morning stars of the barroom girls",
