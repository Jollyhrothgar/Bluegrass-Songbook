  "raw_lyrics": "The worst that I\u2019ve ever been hurt in my life\nThe first time I ever wanted to die\nWas the night when you told me you loved someone new\nAnd  asked me if I could forget\n\nWhen I stop dreaming\nThat\u2019s when I\u2019ll stop loving you\n\nI\u2019d be like a flower unwanted in spring\nAlone and neglected transplanted in vain\nTo a garden of sadness where it\u2019s pedals will fall\nIn the shadow of undying pain\n\nYou can teach the flowers to bloom in the snow\nYou may take a pebble and teach it to grow\nYou can teach all the raindrops to return to the clouds\nBut you can\u2019t teach my heart to forget",
