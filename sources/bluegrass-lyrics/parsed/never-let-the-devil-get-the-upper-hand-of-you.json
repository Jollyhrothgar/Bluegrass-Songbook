  "raw_lyrics": "My tender parents brought me up\nProvided for me well\nTwas in the city of Lanson Town\nThey placed me in a mill\n\nIt was there I spied a pretty fair miss\nOn whom I cast my eye\nI asked her if she\u2019d marry me\nAnd she believed a lie\n\nThree weeks ago last Saturday night\nOf course it was the day\nThe devil put it in my mind\nTo take her life away\n\nI went into her sisters house\nAt eight o\u2019clock one night\nBut little did the sister ? think\nOn her I had my spite\n\nI asked her if she\u2019d take a walk\nWith me a little ways\nThat she and I might have a talk\nAbout our wedding day\n\nWe walked along until we came\nTo my little desert place\nI grabbed a stick off of the fence\nAnd struck her in the face\n\nI run my fingers through her coal black hair\nTo cover up my sin\nI drug her to the river side\nAnd there I plunged her in\n\nI started back unto my mill\nI met my servant John\nHe asked me why I was so pale\nAnd it so very warm\n\nCome all young men and warning take\nUnto your lovers be true\nAnd never let the devil get\nThe upper hand of you\n\nI met my servant John",
