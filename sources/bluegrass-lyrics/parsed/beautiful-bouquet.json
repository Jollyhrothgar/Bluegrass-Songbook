  "raw_lyrics": "For pleasure I went walking out through the fields one day\nI started gathering flowers to make a sweet bouquet\nEach flower that I gathered. each one played a part\nEach flower stood for someone held dear to my heart\n\nBeautiful bouquet I\u2019m gathering today\nPicking the colours that\u2019ll never fade away\nEach flower has a meaning so dear to me\nEach flower is a treasure chestof sweet memories\n\nViolets for my sweetheart, a white rose for my dad\nA red rose stood for mother, the best friend that I had\nForget-me-nots stood faithfully for tried true friends of mine\nDaisies for the puppy loves that I left far behind\n\nLilies are for grandma, who watches from afar\nPoppies are for brother, who lost his life at war\nI put them all together, tomake a sweet bouquet\nA rainbow full of colours that will never fade away",
