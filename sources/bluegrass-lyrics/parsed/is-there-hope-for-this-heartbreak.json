  "raw_lyrics": "In this world of broken hearted\nYou can sing about my one and only pain\nNow I cry my eyes and wonder\nWill I walk this dark and lonely road again\n\nIs there one more hope for this heartbreak\nIs there one last chance or goodbye\nIf I had one wish I would end all this heartache\nOh I wonder how long I could cry\n\nYou could count the stars in heaven\nYou could count a million waves on the sea\nYou\u2019ll never know how many teardrops\nThat I shed for somethin\u2019 never meant to be\n\nWithout love in this lifetime\nYou can count on little boys bein\u2019 blue\nSo don\u2019t wait until tomorrow\nYou may never find yourself a love so true",
