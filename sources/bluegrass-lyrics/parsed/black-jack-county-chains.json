  "raw_lyrics": "I was standin\u2019 by the road in Black Jack County.\nNot knowing that the Sheriff paid a bounty,\nFor men like me who didn\u2019t have a penny to their name.\nHe locked my legs in 35 pounds of Black Jack County Chain.\n\nAll we had to eat was bread and water,\nEveryday we had to build his road a mile and a quarter,\nA Black Snake Whip would sting our backs if some poor fool complained,\nBut we couldn\u2019t fight back wearing 35 pounds of Black Jack County Chain.\n\nThen one night while the Sheriff lay a sleepin\u2019,\nWe all gathered round him slowly creepin\u2019,\nHeaven help me to forget that night in the cold cold rain,\nWhen we beat him to death wearing 35 pounds of Black Jack County Chain.\n\nThe wounds have all healed and I am thankful,\nAnd there\u2019s nothing left but scars around my ankle.\nBut best of all no man will ever be a slave again,\nTo a Black Snake Whip and 35 pounds of Black Jack County Chain.\n\nBut best of all no man will ever be a slave again,",
