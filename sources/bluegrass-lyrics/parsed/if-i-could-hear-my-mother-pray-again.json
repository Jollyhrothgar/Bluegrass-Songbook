  "raw_lyrics": "How sweet and happy seem those days of which I dream\nWhen memory recalls them now and then\nAnd with what repture sweet my weary heart would beat\nIf I could hear my mother pray again\n\nIf I could hear my mother pray again\nIf I could hear her tender voice as then\nSo happy I would be twould mean so much to me\nIf I could hear my mother pray again\n\nShe used to pray that I on Jesus would rely\nAnd always walked the shining gospel way\nSo trusting still his love I seek that home above\nWhere I shall meet my mother some glad day\n\nWithin the old home place her patient smiling face\nWas always spreading comfort hope and cheer\nAnd when she used to sing to her eternal king\nIt was the songs the angels loved to hear\n\nMy work on earth is done the life crown has been won\nAnd she will be at rest with Him above\nAnd some glad morning she I know will welcome me\nTo that eternal home of peace and love",
