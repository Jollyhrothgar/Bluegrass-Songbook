  "raw_lyrics": "A mother went out to a party\nShe left at home her baby son\nHe cried and begged her not to leave him\nBut she would not give up her fun\n\nShe kissed his cheek and tried to soothe him\nBut would not heed his childish plea\nShe heard him call as she was leaving\nPlease mommy please stay home with me\n\nThe mother joined the merrymakers\nAnd soon was lost in trifling joy\nThe mellow tunes and flitting shadows\nMade her forget her baby boy\n\nShe danced and laughed and did some drinking\nThe world for her was full of glee\nBut now and then these words would haunt her\nPlease mommy please stay home with me\n\nShe left the party feeling dizzy\nThe smell of drink was on her breath\nShe hurried home to find her baby\nIn raging pain and nearing death\n\nThe doctor came and looked on sadly\nThe case was hopeless, he could see\nThe baby died, these words repeating\nPlease mommy please stay home with me\n\nThe mother now, her life would forfeit\nTo hear her baby\u2019s voice again\nShe grieved to think she rudely left him\nTo satisfy her wicked vein\n\nNow mothers don\u2019t neglect your duty\nThis story should a lesson be\nDo not ignore your baby\u2019s pleading\nPlease mommy please stay home with me",
