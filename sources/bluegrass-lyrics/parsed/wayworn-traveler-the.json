  "raw_lyrics": "I saw a wayward traveler in tattered garments clad,\nAnd struggling up the mountain, it seemed that he was sad\nHis back was laden heavy, his strength was almost gone,\nIt [sic] shouted as he journeyed, \u201dDeliverance will come!\u201d\n\nThen palms of victory, crowns of glory,\nPalms of victory I shall wear\n\nThe summer sun was shining, the sweat was on his brow,\nHis garments worn and dusty, his step seemed very slow\nBut he kept pressing onward, for he was wending home,\nStill shouting as he journeyed, \u201cDeliverance will come!\u201d\n\nThe songstress in the arbor, that stood beside the way,\nAttracted his attention, inviting his delay\nHis watchword being \u201cOnward!\u201d he stopped his ears and ran,\nStill shouting as he journeyed, \u201dDeliverance will come!\u201d\n\nWhile gazing on that city, just o\u2019er that narrow flood,\nA band of holy angels came from the throne of God\nThey bore him on their pinions, they bore the dashing foam,\nAnd joined him in his triumph, \u201cDeliverance has come!\u201d",
