  "raw_lyrics": "Way down in a lone green valley\nDown where the roses bloom and fade\nThere was a jealous lover\nIn love with a beautiful maid\n\nOne night the moon shone brightly\nThe stars were shining too\nAnd to this maiden\u2019s cottage\nThe jealous lover drew\n\nCome love and we will wander\nWhere the woods are gay\nWhile strolling we will ponder\nUpon our wedding day\n\nSo on and on they wandered\nThe night bird sang above\nThe jealous lover grew angry\nWith the beautiful girl he loved\n\nDown on her knees before him\nShe pleaded for her life\nBut deep into her bossom\nHe plunged the fatal knife\n\nOh Willie won\u2019t you tell me\nWhy have you taken my life\nYou know I\u2019ve always loved you\nAnd wanted to be your wife\n\nI never have deceived you\nBut with my dying breath\nI will forgive you Willie\nAnd close my eyes in death",
