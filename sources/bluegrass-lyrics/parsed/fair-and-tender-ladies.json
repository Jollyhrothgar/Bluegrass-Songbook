  "raw_lyrics": "Come all ye fair and tender ladies\nTake warning how you court your men\nThey\u2019re like a star on a summer morning\nThey first appear and then they\u2019re gone\n\nThey\u2019ll tell to you some loving story\nAnd they\u2019ll make you think that they love you well\nAnd away they\u2019ll go and court some other\nAnd leave you there in grief to dwell\n\nI wish I was on some tall mountain\nWhere the ivy rocks were black as ink\nI\u2019d write a letter to my false true lover\nWhose cheeks are like the morning pink\n\nI wish I was a little sparrow\nAnd I had wings to fly so high\nI\u2019d fly to the arms of my false true lover\nAnd when he\u2019d ask, I would deny\n\nOh love is handsome, love is charming\nAnd love is pretty while it\u2019s new\nBut love grows cold as love grows older\nAnd fades away like morning dew",
