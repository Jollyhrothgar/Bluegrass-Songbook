  "raw_lyrics": "Often times in my memories I wandered again\nTo the little old church by the road\nI can see the dear people and hear them so plain\nSinging songs of that blessed abode\nI can hear my dear mother as she fervently prayed\nBlessed Jesus help me carry my load\nshe was never downhearted and never dismayed\nIn the little old church by the road\n\nThere my mother was praying and the preacher was saying\n\nSinner come and repent your sins\n\nThere the [evil was routed?] and\u00a0 the sisters were singing\n\nAnd brethren saying amen\n\nIt was there I met Jesus and gave Him my life\n\nIt was there He took the weight off my load\n\nAnd He freely removed all my sorrow and strife\n\nIn the little old church by the road\n\nI remember the preacHer so gentle and brave\nAs He told how the Father above\nGave His only son Jesus all the lost ones to save\nSuch wonderful wonderful love\nI will always remember how He spoke when He said\nCome to Jesus He will lighten your load\nAnd so often He told of the life giving bread\nIn the little old church by the road\n\nI can never forget all those lovely old songs\nThat the people so joyfully sang\nHow they told the Lord message to the people gone wrong\nAnd the echos so joyfully rang\nI will always remember when I truly believed\nJesus freely took the weight off my load\nAnd the joy of salvation I truly recieved\nIn the little old church by the road",
