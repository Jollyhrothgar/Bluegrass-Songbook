  "raw_lyrics": "Darlin\u2019, we are growing old\nAnd show the silver in our hair\nSince time has stolen all the gold\nThat made your youthful tresses fair\nBut years can never steal away\nA look that never can grow old\nWhat care we for tresses gray\nSince love will always keep its gold\n\nLove, I\u2019ll tell you with a kiss\nIf Heaven gives back the youth we miss\nYour face will be no fairer then\nWhen silver threads are gold again\n\nDarlin\u2019, I can read today\nThe question in your thoughtful eyes\nYou wonder if I wish for May\nBeneath the frosty autumn skies\nLove of mine, be sure of this\nFor me, no face could be so fair\nThan this one that I stoop to kiss\nBeneath its crown of silver hair\n\nDarlin\u2019, with your hand in mine\nWe\u2019ll journey all life\u2019s pathway through\nWith happy tears your dear eyes shine\nLike deep blue blossoms in the dew\nThe sorrow of the passing years\nHave made us love each other more\nAnd every day that disappears\nI count you dearer than before\n\nLove, I\u2019ll tell you with a kiss\nIf Heaven gives back the youth we miss\nYour face will be no fairer then\nWhen silver threads are gold again",
