  "raw_lyrics": "Billy Grey rode into Gantry back in \u201983\nThere he did meet young Sarah McRae\nThe wild rose of morning that pale flower of dawning\nHerald of springtime in his young life that day\n\nSarah she could not see the daylight of reality\nIn her young eyes Billy bore not a flaw\nKnowing not her chosen one was a hired gun\nWanted in Kansas City by the law\n\nThen one day a tall man came riding \u2018cross the badlands\nLying to the North of New Mexico\nHe was overheard to say he was lookin\u2019 for Bill Grey\nA ruthless man and a dangerous outlaw.\n\nWell the deadly news came creepin\u2019 to Bill Grey fast sleeping\nThere in the Clarendon bar and hotel\nHe fled toward the old church, there on the outskirts\nThinkin\u2019 he\u2019d climb to that old steeple bell\n\nBut a rifle ball came flying face down he lay there dying\nThere in the dust of the road where he fell\nSara she ran to him just cursing the law man\nAccepting no reason knowin\u2019 he was killed\n\nSarah lives in that same old white frame house\nWhere she first met Billy some fifty years ago\nAnd wild rose of morning she\u2019s faded with the dawning\nFor each day of sorrow the long years have sown\n\nAnd written on the stone where the dusty winds have long blown\nEighteen words to a passing world say\nTrue love knows no season, no rhyme nor no reason\nJustice is cold as the Grainger County clay",
