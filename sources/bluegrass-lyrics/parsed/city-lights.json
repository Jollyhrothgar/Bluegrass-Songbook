  "raw_lyrics": "A bright array of city lights as far as I can see\nThe great white way shines through the night for lonely guys like me\nThe cabarets and honky-tonks their flashing signs invite\nA broken heart to lose itself in the glow of city lights\n\nLights that say forget her name in a glass of sherry wine\nLights that offer other girls for empty hearts like mine\nThey paint a pretty picture of a world that\u2019s gay and bright\nBut it\u2019s just a mask for loneliness behind those city lights\n\nThe world was dark and God made stars to brighten up the night\nBut God who put the stars above I don\u2019t believe made those lights\nFor it\u2019s just a place for men to cry when things don\u2019t turn out right\nJust a place to run away and hide behind those city lights",
