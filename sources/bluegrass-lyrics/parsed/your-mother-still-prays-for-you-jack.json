  "raw_lyrics": "The night was dark and stormy\nThe wind was howling wild\nAs an aged mother gazed upon\nThe portrait of her child\nAs she gazed on the baby\u2019s features\nThat once filled her heart with joy\nHe\u2019s now in this wild world roaming\nThat mother\u2019s long lost boy\n\nYour mother still prays for you, Jack\nYour mother still prays for you\nIn a home far over the ocean\nYour mother still prays for you\n\nAt last there came a letter\nIt was deeply edged in black\nFrom a comrade long forgotten\nWho still remembered Jack\nThey have lain your dear old mother\nIn a grave so dark and cold\nAnd she wants her boy who is roaming\nTo meet her on the streets of gold\n\nHis stony heart was broken\nAs he thought of his mother dear\nAnd in spite of his comrades laughing\nHe could not keep back his tears\nIn spite of the great temptations\nThat once filled his heart with tears\nSo he started for Heaven that evening\nAs sweetly the people did sing",
