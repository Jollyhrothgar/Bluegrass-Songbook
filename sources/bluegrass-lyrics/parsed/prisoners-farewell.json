  "raw_lyrics": "Sweetheart a prisoner\u2019s last letter\nI had to send to you today\nBut when you read these words of sorrow\nMy soul will then have passed away\n\nFor at the dawn of day tomorrow\nI then will pay for my mistake\nGod gave me courage for this message\nI\u2019ve realized my sin too late\n\nA letter dear and from a prisoner\nDon\u2019t shed a tear when I am gone\nI\u2019ve troubled you too much already\nI hate to leave you all alone\n\nAs if in dreams I see you smiling\nYour pretty eyes are like a song\nYou warned my darling now I\u2019m pining\nYou knew that I was doing wrong\n\nOutside the shadows now are fading\nThey circle me complete my life\nI\u2019ll soon be gone and when I\u2019m dying\nI\u2019ll think of you and pay the price\n\nI hear the guard outside my window\nAnd on his rounds he seems so slow\nIt seems he\u2019s trying me to comfort\nIt seems he hates to see me go\n\nPlease take this message to my mother\nAnd give her all my love and cheer\nThis final message now I\u2019m writing\nTo one I\u2019ll always love so dear",
