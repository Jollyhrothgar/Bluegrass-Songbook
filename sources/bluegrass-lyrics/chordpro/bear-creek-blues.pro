{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Way up on Bear Creek, watching the sun go down
Way up on Bear Creek, watching the sun go down
It makes me feel like I’m on my last go-’round,
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The water on Bear Creek, it tastes like cherry wine
The water on Bear Creek, it tastes like cherry wine
You take one drink of it, you’re drinking it all the time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
If you stay on Bear Creek, you’ll get like Jesse James
If you stay on Bear Creek, you’ll get like Jesse James
You’ll take two old pistols
and hold up that Bear Creek train
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I’m going high, high up on some lonesome hill
I’m going high, high up on some lonesome hill
Look down on Bear Creek where my good gal used to live
{end_of_verse}
