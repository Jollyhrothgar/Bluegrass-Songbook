{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[D]There are days so [G]dark
That I [D]seek in vain
For the [A]face of my [A7]own true [D]love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But the [D]darkness [G]hides
He is [D]there to guide
By the [A]light of the [A7]moon [D]above
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
[D]Oh the lonesome [G]pines
Oh the [D]lonesome pines
Where I [A]met that [A7]sweetheart of [D]mine
With her [D]hand in [G]mine
And our [D]hearts entwined
As we [A]strolled through the [D]lonesome pines
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Bright stars [D]above
Two sweethearts in [D]love
As we [A]sang to the [A7]cooing [D]doves
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[D]He has brought me [G]back
To that [D]mountain shack
By the touch of her hand in [D]love
{end_of_verse}
