[D]There are days so [G]dark
That I [D]seek in vain
For the [A]face of my [A7]own true [D]love
{end_of_verse}

But the [D]darkness [G]hides
He is [D]there to guide
By the [A]light of the [A7]moon [D]above
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Oh the lonesome pines
Oh the lonesome pines
Where I met that sweetheart of mine
With her hand in mine
And our hearts entwined
As we strolled through the lonesome pines
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Bright stars [D]above
Two sweethearts in [D]love
As we [A]sang to the [A7]cooing [D]doves
{end_of_verse}

[D]He has brought me [G]back
To that [D]mountain shack
By the touch of her hand in [D]love
