{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Oh the night was dark and stormy
When this message came to me
It was from my darlin’ Nellie
Who had sailed across the sea
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
I was wanderin’ through the grave yard
When I found where Nellie lay
It was there my heart was broken
It was there I knelt to pray
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But remember; darlin’ Nellie
There’s a home for us on high
I will meet you darlin’ Nellie
When they lay me down to die
{end_of_verse}
