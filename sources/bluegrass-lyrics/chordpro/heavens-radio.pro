{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
There’s a wonderful invention called the radio
You can hear it every where you chance to go
But the static in the air sometimes makes it hard to hear
But it is not so with heaven’s radio
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Heaven’s radio on the other shore
For my precious savior always listens in
It’s the same old radio that was used long time ago
For my precious savior always listens in
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Daniel in the lions den with this power should surely win
For my precious savior always listens in
And I know without a doubt honest prayers will bring you out
For my precious savior always listens in
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well He set the Hebrews three from the fiery furnace free
For my precious savior always listens in
He will rescue you today in that same old fashioned way
For my precious savior always listens in
{end_of_verse}
