[A]There’s a wonderful invention [D]called the [A]radio

But it is not so with [E]heaven’s [A]radio

[E]Heaven’s [A]radio on the other shore
For my precious savior [E]always listens [E]in
It’s the [A]same old [A]radio that was [D]used long time [A]ago
For my precious savior [E]always listens [E]in
{end_of_chorus}

And I [A]know [E]without a doubt honest [D]prayers will bring you [A]out
For my precious savior [E]always listens [E]in
{end_of_verse}

For my precious savior [E]always listens [E]in
