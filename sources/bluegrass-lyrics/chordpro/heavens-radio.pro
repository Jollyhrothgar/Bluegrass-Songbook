{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
There’s a [A]wonderful invention [D]called the [A]radio
You can [A]hear it every where you chance to [E]go
But the [A]static [E]in the air sometimes [D]makes it hard to [A]hear
But it is not so with [E]heaven’s [A]radio

[E]Heaven’s [A]radio on the other shore
For my precious savior [E]always listens [E]in
It’s the [A]same old [A]radio that was [D]used long time [A]ago
For my precious savior [E]always listens [E]in
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Daniel [E]in the lions den with this power should surely win
For my precious savior [E]always listens [E]in
And I know without a doubt honest prayers will bring you out
For my precious savior [E]always listens [E]in
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well He set the Hebrews three from the fiery furnace free
For my precious savior [E]always listens [E]in
