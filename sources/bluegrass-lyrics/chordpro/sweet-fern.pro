{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Springtime is coming sweet lonesome bird
Your [A]echo in the [A7]woodland I [D]hear
Down in the meadow so lonesome your singing
While the [A]moonlight is [A7]shining so [D]clear
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But I [G]know he’s away in a [D]far distant [A]land
A [A]land that is over the [D]sea
Go fly to him singing your sweet little song
And [A]tell him to [A7]come back to [D]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Sweet [D]fern, sweet [D]fern
Oh [A]tell [D]me, is my [A7]darling still [D]true
Sweet [D]fern, sweet [D]fern
I’ll [A]be just as [A7]happy as [D]you
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Oh [A]tell [D]me sweet [D]fern, is he thinking of [D]me
And [A]the promise [A7]he made long [D]ago
He said he’d return from over the [D]sea
Oh [A]why do the [A7]years go so [D]slow
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
But I [G]know he’s away in a [D]far distant [A]land
A [A]land that is over the [D]sea
Go fly to him singing your sweet little song
And [A]tell him to [A7]come back to [D]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Upon my finger he placed a small ring
On [A]the day he [A7]was leaving [D]his home
I promised I’d [A]be his own little girl
And [A]love him [A7]wherever he’d [D]roam
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
But I [G]know he’s away in a [D]far distant [A]land
A [A]land that is over the [D]sea
Go fly to him singing your sweet little song
And [A]tell him to [A7]come back to [D]me
{end_of_verse}
