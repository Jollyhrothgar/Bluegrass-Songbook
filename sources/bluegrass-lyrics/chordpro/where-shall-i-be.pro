{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Judgment day is drawing nigh
Where shall I be
When God the work of men shall cry
Where shall I be
When east and west the fire will roll
Where shall I be
How will it be with my poor soul
Where shall I be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Oh where shall I be when the first trumpet sounds
Oh where shall I be when it sounds so loud
When it sounds so loud as to wake up the dead
Oh where shall I be when it sounds
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
When wicked men its wrath shall see
Where shall I be
And to the rocks and mountains flee
Where shall I be
And hills and mountains wear away
Where shall I be
And all the work of men decay
Where shall I be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
When the savior reigns from shore to shore
When God’s angry presence roars
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Oh I’ll be sleeping in my grave when the first trumpet sounds
Oh I’ll be sleeping in my grave when it sounds so loud
When it sounds so loud as to wake up the dead
Oh I’ll be sleeping in my grave when it sounds
{end_of_chorus}
