Judgment day is drawing nigh
[D]Where shall I [A]be
[A]When God the work of men shall cry

[D]Where shall I [A]be
[A]How will it [A]be with my poor soul
[D]Where shall I [A]be
{end_of_verse}

[A]Oh [D]where shall I [A]be [A]when the [D]first trumpet [A]sounds
[A]Oh [D]where shall I [A]be [A]when it [A]sounds so loud
[A]When it [A]sounds so loud as to [D]wake up the [A]dead
[A]Oh [D]where shall I [A]be [A]when it [A]sounds

[A]When wicked men its wrath shall see
[D]Where shall I [A]be
[A]And to the rocks and mountains flee

[D]Where shall I [A]be
[A]And all the [A]work of men decay
[D]Where shall I [A]be

[A]Oh I’ll [A]be sleeping in my grave [A]when the [D]first trumpet [A]sounds
[A]Oh I’ll [A]be sleeping in my grave [A]when it [A]sounds so loud
[A]When it [A]sounds so loud as to [D]wake up the [A]dead
[A]Oh I’ll [A]be sleeping in my grave [A]when it [A]sounds
