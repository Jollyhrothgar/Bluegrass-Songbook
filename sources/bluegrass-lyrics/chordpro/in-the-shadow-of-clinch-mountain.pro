{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I [D]grew up on the side of Clinch Mountain
With the [G]beauties and the music of the [D]woods
The sweet [G]song of the bright bubbling [D]fountain
and the [A]warble of the [A7]birds I understood
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
When I’ve sung my last [G]song in the evening
And the sun sets in the golden west
All the scenes of this world I’ll be leaving
In the shadow of Clinch Mountain I will rest
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Long ago said the oak and the cedar
Singing deeply in a whisper of the past
Stood not then this great towering leader
nor the [D]fountain where the crystal gems are kept (passed?)
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Then I asked how this green lofty mountain
in the caldron the lonely desert stood
Said this [G]song of the bright sunny [D]fountain
We were given by the waters of the flood
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Out that gate I have passed since my childhood
O’er the railway through the tunnel to the west
singing songs of the Clinch Mountain wildwoods
[G]Song that people found and [A7]birds loved the best
{end_of_verse}
