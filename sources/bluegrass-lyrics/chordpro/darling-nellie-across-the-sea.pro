{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[A]Oh the night was dark and stormy
When this message came to [A]me
[A]It was from my [E]darling Nellie
Who is [E]far across the [A]sea
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
[A]Oh dear Jack I know I’m [A]dying
I’ve no friends or parents [E]nigh
[A]But remember [E]dearest Jackie
There’s a [E]home for us on [A]high
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[A]Oh dear mother I must leave you
I must go across the [A]sea
[A]I must find my [D]darling Nellie
Who so dearly cared for [A]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
[A]I was wondering through [A]the grave yard
When found where Nellie [E]lay
[A]It was there my [E]heart was broken
It was [E]there I knelt and [A]prayed
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[A]Now I’m left alone in sadness
On the fields the flowers [A]wave
[A]And the girl I [E]love is sleeping
In the [E]cold and silent [A]grave
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
[A]Lay me where my Nellie’s sleeping
Close beside her let [A]me lie
[A]Where the blooming [A]flowers are creeping
There [A]oh lay [A]me when I die
{end_of_chorus}
