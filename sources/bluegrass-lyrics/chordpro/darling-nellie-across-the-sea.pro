{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Oh the night was dark and stormy
When this message came to me
It was from my darling Nellie
Who is far across the sea
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Oh dear Jack I know I’m dying
I’ve no friends or parents nigh
But remember dearest Jackie
There’s a home for us on high
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh dear mother I must leave you
I must go across the sea
I must find my darling Nellie
Who so dearly cared for me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
I was wondering through the grave yard
When found where Nellie lay
It was there my heart was broken
It was there I knelt and prayed
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now I’m left alone in sadness
On the fields the flowers wave
And the girl I love is sleeping
In the cold and silent grave
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Lay me where my Nellie’s sleeping
Close beside her let me lie
Where the blooming flowers are creeping
There oh lay me when I die
{end_of_chorus}
