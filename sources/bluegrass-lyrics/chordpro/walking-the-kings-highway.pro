Walking in the kings highway
There’ll be singing where salvation goes
Walking in the kings highway

There’s a highway there and away
Where sorrow shall flee away
And the light shines bright as the day
Walking in the kings highway

No unclean things shall pass or hear
Walking in the kings highway
Just the ransom ones without a fear
Walking in the kings highway
