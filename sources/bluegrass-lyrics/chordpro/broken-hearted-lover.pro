{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]How could I be [F]feeling happy
[G]When you don’t [C]love me anymore
[C]You took my [F]love and all [G]my kisses
[C]And you left [C]my heart so sore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
[F]I’d rather swim [G]across the ocean
[C]Without the help [C]of God or man
[F]Than be a [G]broken hearted lover
[C]When I have done [C]the best I can
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]I thought that you [G]were an angel
[C]When I first looked [C]into your eyes
[F]But now I [G]know all about you
[C]I know your home’s [C]not in the skies
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]Stop, look and [G]listen for [C]that whistle
[C]And when you hear [F]that lonesome sound
[G]You’ll know by [C]the whistle [C]of that freight train
[F]Your broken [G]hearted lover’s gone
{end_of_verse}
