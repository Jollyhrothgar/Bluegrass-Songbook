{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]How could I be feeling happy
When you don’t [F]love me anymore
You took my love [G]and all my kisses
And you left my heart so [C]sore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
[C]I’d rather swim across the ocean
Without the help [F]of God or man
Than be a [G]broken hearted lover
When I have done the best I [C]can
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]I thought that you were an angel
When I first looked [F]into your eyes
But now I [G]know all about you
I know your home’s not in the [C]skies
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]Stop, look and listen for that whistle
And when you hear [F]that lonesome sound
You’ll know by the [G]whistle of that freight train
Your broken hearted lover’s [C]gone
{end_of_verse}
