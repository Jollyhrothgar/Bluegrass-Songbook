{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
This [A7]world is not my home I’m just-a-passing through
My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue
The [D]angels beckon me from Heaven’s open door
And I can’t feel at home in this [A7]world anymore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh Lord [D]you know I have no friend like [D]you
If Heaven’s not my home oh Lord what would I do
The [D]angels beckon me from Heaven’s open door
And I can’t feel at home in this [A7]world anymore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
They’re [A7]all expecting me that’s one thing I know
I fixed it up with Jesus a long time ago
I know he’ll take me through though I am weak and poor
And I can’t feel at home in this [A7]world anymore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Just over in the gloryland there’ll be no dying there
The saints [A7]all shouting victory and [A7]singing everywhere
I hear the voice of those that’s gone on before
And I can’t feel at home in this [A7]world anymore
{end_of_verse}
