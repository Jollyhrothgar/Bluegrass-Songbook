{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I [F]once had a dark haired true lover
[F]She was all this world to me
She promised herself to [F]another
[F]Now don’t you think this was mean
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Take back [C]every word you have [F]spoken
Let it [C]be as though we never [F]met
For tonight [C]I’m a poor boy [F]heartbroken
I’ll [C]forgive but I’ll never [F]forget
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [F]was young when I wrote my first letter
[F]I blotted the lines with tears
But now I am old [F]I know better
[F]We parted for many long years
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Oh [F]Ruth, Oh Ruth how I love you
You [B]just seem to me [F]like a bird
Although you went back [F]on your promise
[B]Although you went back [F]on your word
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
We [F]parted in the month of September
[F]Some said we parted for life
But I hope someday or [F]another
I’ll [B]call you my sweet [F]darling wife
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I [F]wish I had someone to love me
[F]Someone to call me their own
For I’m out in this wide [F]world a wandering
[F]I’m tired of living alone
{end_of_verse}
