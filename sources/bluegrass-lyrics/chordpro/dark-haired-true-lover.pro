{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I [F]once had a dark haired true lover
She was all this world to me
She promised herself to [F]another
Now don’t you think this was mean
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Take back every word you have spoken
Let it be as though we never met
For tonight I’m a poor boy heartbroken
I’ll forgive but I’ll never forget
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I was young when I wrote my first letter
I blotted the lines with tears
But now I am old I know better
We parted for many long years
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Oh Ruth, Oh Ruth how I love you
You just seem to me like a bird
Although you went back on your promise
Although you went back on your word
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
We parted in the month of September
Some said we parted for life
But I hope someday or [F]another
I’ll call you my sweet darling wife
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I wish I had someone to love me
Someone to call me their own
For I’m out in this wide world a wandering
I’m tired of living alone
{end_of_verse}
