{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I know a little girl and I want her for my wife
She’s pretty and sweet neat little feet and never been kissed in her life
You can ask her for a kiss she said oh what a bore
Every time she bows and declares she’ll never do so anymore
Born to be a better girl and never kiss again
Afraid my ma might find it out and cause her great pain
You may walk and talk and hold my hand but kissing is a crime
I’ll not kiss you anymore until next time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I called at her house one night but I didn’t intend to stay
She laid her head on my shoulder and said the old folks are away
I kissed her a dozen times and someone came to the door
Every time she bowed and declared she’d never do so anymore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
She’ll see you too the door kiss and then goodnight
Every time she bows and declares she’ll never do so any more
{end_of_verse}
