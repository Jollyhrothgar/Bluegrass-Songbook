{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[D]We have met and [D]we have [G]parted
[D]We have [D]spoke our last goodbye
You have [D]proved to me false [G]hearted
You may [D]now [A]forever [D]go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[D]You have wrecked the [D]heart I’ve [G]cherished
[D]You have [D]done me day by day
You are [D]false but I’ll [G]forgive you
To [D]forget [A]you I [D]cannot say
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[D]For I love you [D]dear I [G]love you
[D]More than [D]all this world I know
You have [D]proved to me false [G]hearted
You may [D]now [A]forever [D]go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[D]On the river [D]bank I’ll [G]loiter
[D]Till I [D]see your face once more
Then I’ll [D]plunge beneath the [G]water
And I’ll [D]land [A]on some far [D]shore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[D]Among the trees [D]and [G]bushes
[D]Where the [D]dark green willow sway
In [D]the cold and silent [G]rushes
There you’ll [D]find [A]my lonely [D]grave
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
[D]O I wish I [D]was white [G]marble
[D]Cold and [D]white on some far shore
This poor [D]heart would cease from [G]troubling
And I’d [D]feel [A]the pain no [D]more
{end_of_verse}
