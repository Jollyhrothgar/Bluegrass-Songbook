{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
We have met and we have parted
We have spoke our last goodbye
You have proved to me false hearted
You may now forever go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You have wrecked the heart I’ve cherished
You have done me day by day
You are false but I’ll forgive you
To forget you I cannot say
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
For I love you dear I love you
More than all this world I know
You have proved to me false hearted
You may now forever go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
On the river bank I’ll loiter
Till I see your face once more
Then I’ll plunge beneath the water
And I’ll land on some far shore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Among the trees and bushes
Where the dark green willow sway
In the cold and silent rushes
There you’ll find my lonely grave
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
O I wish I was white marble
Cold and white on some far shore
This poor heart would cease from troubling
And I’d feel the pain no more
{end_of_verse}
