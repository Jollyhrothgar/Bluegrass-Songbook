{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I [D]find many people who [A]can’t understand
Why I am so [A7]happy and [D]free
I’ve [D7]crossed over Jordan to [G]Canaan’s fair land
And [D]this is like [A]heaven to [D]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Oh [D]this is like [A]heaven to [D]me
Yes [D]this is like [A]heaven to [D]me
I’ve [D7]crossed over Jordan to [G]Canaan’s fair land
And [D]this is like [A]heaven to [D]me
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I’ve [D]heard the sweet music the [A]heavenly chorus
From glory [A7]land over the [D]sea
The [D7]soul thrilling message from [G]Jesus my lord
And [D]this is like [A]heaven to [D]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I’m [D]looking for Jesus [A]in glory to come
From glory [A7]land over the [D]sea
A cloud of bright angels to carry [D]me home
And that will be [A]heaven to [D]me
{end_of_verse}
