{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]One beautiful night when the [F]moon was full
And the [C]air was crisp and [G]clear
A cowboy lay on the star lit [F]plain
And [G]thought of his [G7]home so [C]dear
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G]He thought of his mother he loved so well
And his [C]slumber of sleep [G]was blurred
Not a sound to be heard but throws of [F]the night
As [G]he sang a wild [G7]song to [C]his herd
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]The cattle are lying so [F]quite and still
On a [C]carpet that mantles [G]the west ?
While the golden lanes from the sky [F]of night
Sing [G]peace to the [G7]cowboys [C]stress ?
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]Still he thinks of his mother in [F]a far away land
And his [C]thoughts by his memory [G]was stirred
And he steals himself the old [G7]home again
As [G]he sang a wild [G7]song to [C]his herd
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[C]He’s far from the din of [F]the city noise
Where the [C]lanes of folly [G]do shine
He’s far from the jaws of the dies [F]sin ?
[G]And the flow [G7]of sparkling [C]wine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
[C]He’s in the great west with its [F]mantle of green
Where his [C]neighbors say never [G]a word
A land of marriage of mountains [F]and plains
Where [G]a cowboy sings [G7]low to [C]his herd
{end_of_verse}
