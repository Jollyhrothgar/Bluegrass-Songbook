{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
One beautiful night when the moon was full
And the air was crisp and clear
A cowboy lay on the star lit plain
And thought of his home so dear
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
He thought of his mother he loved so well
And his slumber of sleep was blurred
Not a sound to be heard but throws of the night
As he sang a wild song to his herd
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The cattle are lying so quite and still
On a carpet that mantles the west ?
While the golden lanes from the sky of night
Sing peace to the cowboys stress ?
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Still he thinks of his mother in a far away land
And his thoughts by his memory was stirred
And he steals himself the old home again
As he sang a wild song to his herd
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
He’s far from the din of the city noise
Where the lanes of folly do shine
He’s far from the jaws of the dies sin ?
And the flow of sparkling wine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
He’s in the great west with its mantle of green
Where his neighbors say never a word
A land of marriage of mountains and plains
Where a cowboy sings low to his herd
{end_of_verse}
