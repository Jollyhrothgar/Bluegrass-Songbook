{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[E]When [A]first I met my darling [D]daisies
[E]Down by the garden [A]wall
I was walking along the street so [D]shady
I was [E]going for a [E7]twilight [A]call
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
I [A]love to sing and dance among the [D]roses
[E]Down by the garden [A]wall
Tis there I’d like to meet my [D]daisies
[E]When I make a [E7]twilight [A]call
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
She was sleeping in a bed of [D]roses
Dreaming of the by and by
While the little birds around were singing
Up above the branches so high
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
If you want to see a bright eyed beauty
Bright as the stars that shine
Just come and go with me some evening
To see this pretty girl of mine
{end_of_verse}
