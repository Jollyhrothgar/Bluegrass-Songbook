{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
When first I met my darling daisies
Down by the garden wall
I was walking along the street so shady
I was going for a twilight call
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
I love to sing and dance among the roses
Down by the garden wall
Tis there I’d like to meet my daisies
When I make a twilight call
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
She was sleeping in a bed of roses
Dreaming of the by and by
While the little birds around were singing
Up above the branches so high
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
If you want to see a bright eyed beauty
Bright as the stars that shine
Just come and go with me some evening
To see this pretty girl of mine
{end_of_verse}
