{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Just one [D]year ago [A]today love
I [A7]became your [A]happy [D]bride
Changed a [D7]mansion for a [G]cottage
To [A]live by the river [D]side
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You [D]told me I’d be [A]happy
But no [A7]happiness I [D]see
For [D7]tonight I am a [G]widow
In the [G]cottage by the [D]sea
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
All [D]alone by the seaside he [A]left me
And no [A7]other’s [D]bride [D]I’ll be
For in [D7]bridal flowers he [G]begged me
In the [G]cottage by the [D]sea
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
From my [G]cottage by the seaside
I can [D]see my [D7]mansion home
I can [D]see those hills and valleys
Where with pleasure I have roamed
{end_of_verse}

The last time that I saw him
Oh how [A]happy then were we
But [D7]tonight I am a [G]widow
In the [G]cottage by the [D]sea
{end_of_verse}
