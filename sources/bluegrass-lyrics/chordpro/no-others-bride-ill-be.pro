{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Just one year ago today love
I became your happy bride
Changed a mansion for a cottage
To live by the river side
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You told me I’d be happy
But no happiness I see
For tonight I am a widow
In the cottage by the sea
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
All alone by the seaside he left me
And no other’s bride I’ll be
For in bridal flowers he begged me
In the cottage by the sea
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
From my cottage by the seaside
I can see my mansion home
I can see those hills and valleys
Where with pleasure I have roamed
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
The last time that I saw him
Oh how happy then were we
But tonight I am a widow
In the cottage by the sea
{end_of_verse}
