{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[D]Just let me tell you how a [A]liar will do
He’s always coming with [A]something new
He’ll [D]steal your heart with false pretence
Making out like he’s your [A]bosom [D]friend
[D]If you don’t want to [D]get in trouble
[D]If you don’t want to [D]get in trouble
[D]If you don’t want to [D]get in trouble
Better [D]let that [A]liar [D]alone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[A]When a liar takes the notion to bend the truth
He’ll lay around his neighbors and [D]get the news
[A]And nearly every day when [D]you look out
You can see that [A]liar coming to your house
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[A]He’ll tell you such a lie it’ll [D]surprise your mind
[A]He’ll mix a little truth for [D]to make it shine
[A]When he gets his business [D]fixed just right
[A]Then that liar’s going to [D]cause a fight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[A]He studies up a lie he’ll [D]tell it so smooth
[A]You’ll think absolutely that [D]it must be true
[A]And he’ll urge you out for to [D]trace the tale
And [D]if you don’t mind you’ll be put in jail
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[A]When everything’s in [D]perfect peace
Then comes that [A]liar with his deceit
A hypocrite [A]liar both keeps up a fuss
[A]They’re both very bad but a [D]liar’s the worse
{end_of_verse}
