{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Twas in St Louis city where I [C]first saw the [G]light
Brought up by honest parents on a [D]pathway of right
I was [G]left on orphan at the [C]age of ten [G]years
On mother’s grave I [D]shed many [G]tears
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I’d scarcely reached manhood when I [G]left my old home
With some other fellows to the [D]west we did roam

We seemed so poor and the [D]people [G]unkind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Was in New York City where we [C]first met our fate
We were arrested while [D]roaming the streets

But they said it would place us [D]behind the [G]stone walls
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[G]We were marched next morning to the [C]courthouse for [G]trial

They gave us twenty [G]years behind the stone walls
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[G]We were handcuffed next morning [C]and marched to [G]the pen

Just learn to be a convict [D]behind the [G]stone walls
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
[G]While lying that night on a [C]pallet of [G]straw
I swore I would never [D]again break the law
There’s [G]none but your mother to [C]bear your [G]downfall
When you are a convict [D]behind the [G]stone walls
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
[G]Come all you young fellows and [C]listen to [G]me
When you lose life’s pleasures you’ve [D]lost liberty
I’ve [G]tasted life’s pleasures it’s [C]bitter than [G]gall
It’ll lead to a cell [D]behind the [G]stone wall
{end_of_verse}
