{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Oh listen to the train coming down the line
Trying to make up all their lost time
From Buffalo to Washington
You can wash my jumper starch my overalls
Catch a train they call the Cannonball
From Buffalo to Washington
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
My baby’s left me she even took my shoes
Enough to give a man these doggone worried blues
She’s gone she’s solid gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Yonder comes the train coming down the track
Carry me away but it aint gonna carry me back
My honey babe my blue eyed babe
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I’m going up north I’m going up north this fall
If luck don’t change I wont be back at all
My honey babe I’m leaving you
{end_of_verse}
