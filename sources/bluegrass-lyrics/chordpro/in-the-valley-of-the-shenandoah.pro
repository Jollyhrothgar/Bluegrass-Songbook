{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
As we sit alone tonight
In the stillness of the night
I picture happy scenes of long ago
Of a maiden fair and bright
Who is sleeping there tonight
In the valley of the Shenandoah ridge
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
It was in the month of June
When the roses were in bloom
When I held her in my arms and softly said
Darling in the coming spring
I’ll be coming back again
To the valley of the Shenandoah ridge
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
When I left her all alone
In our Shenandoah home
She promised she’d be waiting there for me
But the angels came along
And took her from our home
From the valley of the Shenandoah ridge
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
When the evening shadows fall
In memory I recall
A pledge when giving her a ring
Darling in the coming spring
I’ll be coming back again
To the valley of the Shenandoah ridge
{end_of_verse}
