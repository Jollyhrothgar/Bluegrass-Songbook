{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[D]As we sit alone tonight
[A]In the stillness of the night
I picture happy [A]scenes of long [D]ago
Of a [A]maiden fair and [D]bright
Who is [A]sleeping there [D]tonight
[A]In the valley of the [A]Shenandoah [D]ridge
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
It was [A]in the month of [A7]June
When the [D]roses were [A]in bloom
When I [G]held her [A]in my [D]arms and softly [A7]said
Darling [A]in the coming spring
I’ll be [A]coming back [D]again
To the valley of the [A]Shenandoah [D]ridge
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[D]When I left her all alone
[A]In our [A]Shenandoah home
She promised she’d be [A]waiting there for [D]me
But the [A]angels came [D]along
And took her [A]from our [D]home
From the valley of the [A]Shenandoah [D]ridge
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[D]When the evening shadows fall
[A]In memory I recall
A pledge when [A]giving her a [D]ring
Darling [A]in the coming spring
I’ll be [A]coming back [D]again
To the valley of the [A]Shenandoah [D]ridge
{end_of_verse}
