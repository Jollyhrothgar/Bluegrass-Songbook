{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Beyond the sea where faiths of glorious beam
Where things abide that I have never seen
The soul’s sweet home desperate never more
Will there be room for me on that bright shore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
There’s room (room for you and me) yes room (room for you and me)
There’s room (room for me) for all (room enough for all)
There’s room (yes there’s room for me) for all (room enough for all)
There’s room (room enough in heaven) for me
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
That wondrous city far beyond confine
Where all is joy and peace so pure divine
In visions I in varying streaks can see
And wonder if there’s room in heaven for me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I long to soar away and be at rest
And there to lean upon my savior’s breast
Oh wont that be a glorious victory
To find that there is room in heaven for me
{end_of_verse}
