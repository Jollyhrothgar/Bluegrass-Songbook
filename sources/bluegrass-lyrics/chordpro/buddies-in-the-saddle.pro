{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[A]One stormy day, me and my [D]buddy
Started [A]on our roundup [E]ride
The wind and [A]dust blew hard [D]around us,
My [D]buddy [A]strayed far [E]from my [A]side
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
We were [A]buddies in the [D]saddle,
We were [A]buddies in our [E]home,
We were [A]buddies herding [D]cattle,
We were [A]buddies everywhere we [A]roamed
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[A]I’ll ne’er forget the day [D]I found him,
He was [A]so weak he could [E]not speak
I’ll ne’er [A]forget the smile [D]he gave me,
[D]Then the [A]poor [E]boy fell [A]asleep
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I took him up in my [D]saddle
And [A]carried him across [E]the plain
My mother [A]nursed him [D]every moment
[D]To try [A]to make [E]him well [A]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[A]I’ve never had a pal [D]so near me,
He took [A]the blame for [E]everything
I’d die for [A]him just any [D]moment,
[D]And for [A]me he’d [E]do the [A]same
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[A]But now by buddy’s gone [D]and left me,
And it’s [A]so hard to [E]struggle ‘long
So hard to [A]believe that he [D]has left me,
I [D]can’t [A]realize [E]that he [A]has gone
{end_of_verse}
