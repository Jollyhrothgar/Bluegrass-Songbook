{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I’ve found a sweet haven of sunshine at last,
and Jesus abiding above,
His dear arms around me are lovingly cast
and sweetly He tells His love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The tempest is o’er
(The danger, the tempest forever is o’er)
I’m safe evermore
(My anchor is holding I’m safe ever more)
What gladness what rapture is mine
The danger is past
(The water’s receding, the danger is past)
I’m anchored at last
(I’m feeling so happy I’m anchored at last)
I’m anchored in love divine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
He saw me endangered and lovingly came
To pilot my storm-beaten soul
Sweet peace He has spoken and bless His dear name
The billows no longer roll
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
His love shall control me through life and in death
Completely I’ll trust to the end
I’ll praise Him each hour and my last fleeting breath
Shall sing of my soul’s Best Friend
{end_of_verse}
