{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I’ve [A]found a sweet haven of sunshine [A]at [A]last,
and Jesus abiding [E]above,
His [A]dear arms around me are [D]lovingly [A]cast
and sweetly He [E]tells His [A]love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The [A]tempest is o’er
(The [E]danger, the [A]tempest forever is o’er)
I’m [D]safe evermore
(My anchor is holding I’m [D]safe ever more)
What gladness what rapture is [E]mine
The [E]danger is past
(The water’s receding, the [E]danger is past)
I’m [D]anchored [A]at [A]last
(I’m feeling so happy I’m [D]anchored [A]at [A]last)
I’m [D]anchored in [A]love divine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
He saw me endangered and [D]lovingly came
To pilot my storm-beaten soul
Sweet peace He has spoken and bless His [A]dear name
The billows no longer roll
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
His [A]love shall control me through life and in death
Completely I’ll trust to the end
I’ll praise Him each hour and my [A]last fleeting breath
Shall sing of my soul’s Best Friend
{end_of_verse}
