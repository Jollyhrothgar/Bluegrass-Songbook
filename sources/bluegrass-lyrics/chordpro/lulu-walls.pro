{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
One evening getting dark, we first met at the park
Sitting by the fountain all alone;
I lifted up my hat, and then began to chat
She said she’d love to see me at her home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Such a star I’ve never seen, she’s as pretty as a queen
She’s as perfect as an angel from above,
If she’ll only be my wife, I’ll live happy all my life
With that aggravating beauty, Lulu Walls
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
If she were only mine, I would build a house so fine
Around it so many fences tall,
It would make me jealous free, that no one else but me
Could gaze on that beauty, Lulu Walls
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
One evening getting late, I met her at the gate
I asked her if she’d wed me in the fall,
She only turned away, and nothing would she say
That aggravating beauty, Lulu Walls
{end_of_verse}
