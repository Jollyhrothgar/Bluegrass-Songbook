{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]The flowers I saw in [G]the wildwood
[D7]Have since dropped their [G]beautiful leaves
And [G]the many dear friends of my childhood
Have [D]slumbered many [D7]years in their [G]graves
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But [G]the bloom of [G]the flowers I remember
[G]Though their smiles [D]I may [D7]never more see
For [G]the cold chilly winds of December
Stole [D]my flowers’ [D7]companions [G]from me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
[G]It’s no [G]wonder that I’m [D]broken hearted
[D7]And stricken with sorrow [G]should be
[D7]For we have [G]met we have loved [G]we have parted
[D7]My flowers companions [G]and me
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G]How dark looks this world and [G]how dreary
When we part from [G]the ones that we love
There is rest for [G]the faint and [G]the weary
And [D]friends to meet [D7]with loved ones [G]above
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[G]For in heaven I can [G]but remember
[D7]When from earth my soul shall [G]be free
There [G]no cold chilly winds of December
Shall [D]steal my [D7]companions from [G]me
{end_of_verse}
