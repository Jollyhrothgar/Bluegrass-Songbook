{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]The flowers I saw in [G]the wildwood
Have since dropped their beautiful leaves
And [G]the many dear friends of my childhood
Have [D]slumbered many [D7]years in their [G]graves
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But [G]the bloom of [G]the flowers I remember
Though their smiles I may never more see
For [G]the cold chilly winds of December
Stole my flowers’ companions from me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
It’s no wonder that I’m broken hearted
And stricken with sorrow should be
For we have met we have loved we have parted
My flowers companions and me
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
How dark looks this world and how dreary
When we part from [G]the ones that we love
There is rest for [G]the faint and [G]the weary
And friends to meet with loved ones above
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
For in heaven I can but remember
When from earth my soul shall be free
There no cold chilly winds of December
Shall steal my companions from me
{end_of_verse}
