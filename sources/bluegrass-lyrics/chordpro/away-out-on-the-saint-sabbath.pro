{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[A]Away out on the old saint Sabbath
Lay down to [D]take my [A]rest
My knapsack for my pillow
And my gun upon my chest
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Please don’t [E]bury me on the lonesome [A]prairie
Please don’t [E]bury me on the lone [A]prairie
You can [E]bury me in the east
You can [E]bury me in the west
Please don’t [E]bury me on the lone [A]prairie
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
My father he lies sleeping
Beneath the deep blue sea
I have no father no mother
There’s none but hell and me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
My mother she lies sleeping
Beneath the church yard rocks
Her body lies there moldering
And her spirit has gone to God
{end_of_verse}
