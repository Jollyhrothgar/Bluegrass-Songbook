{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Away out on the old saint Sabbath
Lay down to take my rest
My knapsack for my pillow
And my gun upon my chest
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Please don’t bury me on the lonesome prairie
Please don’t bury me on the lone prairie
You can bury me in the east
You can bury me in the west
Please don’t bury me on the lone prairie
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
My father he lies sleeping
Beneath the deep blue sea
I have no father no mother
There’s none but hell and me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
My mother she lies sleeping
Beneath the church yard rocks
Her body lies there moldering
And her spirit has gone to God
{end_of_verse}
