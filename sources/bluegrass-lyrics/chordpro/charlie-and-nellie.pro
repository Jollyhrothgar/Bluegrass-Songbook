{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Dear Nellie since I left the city
I’ve found I’ve changed my mind
I hope you wont think me untruthful
Or do me the least unkind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I think we’re both mistaken
I know you’ll never suit me
I owe my heart to another
Of course kind friends will agree
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Please send me my ring and pictures
Also my letters and books
My clothes with many kind wishes
Respectfully yours Charlie Brooks
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I heard all about it dear Charlie
I knew it would end this way
I hope you will always live happy
With your loving little wife Miss Gray
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Now here’s your ring dear Charlie
Don’t give it to her I pray
Unless you tell her twas once mine
I wore it one year today
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
One year today dear Charlie
So happy were we both
You vowed you’d never forsake me
But I find you untrue to your oath
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Here’s your picture dear Charlie
It’s almost faded away
Because I kissed it so often
And this you can tell Miss Gray
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
As far as your letters dear Charlie
I burned them as they came
I feared by reading them over
Would cause our love to inflame
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 9}
I must say goodbye dear Charlie
My letter is near an end
Remember I’m always and always
Forever and ever your friend
{end_of_verse}
