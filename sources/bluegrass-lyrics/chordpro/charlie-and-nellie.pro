{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Dear Nellie since I left the city
I’ve [C]found I’ve changed my [G]mind
I hope you wont think [G]me untruthful
Or [C]do [G]me the [D]least [G]unkind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I think we’re both mistaken
I [C]know you’ll never suit [G]me
I owe my heart to another
Of [C]course kind [D]friends will [G]agree
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Please send [G]me my ring and pictures
[C]Also my letters and [G]books
My clothes with many kind wishes
[C]Respectfully [D]yours Charlie [G]Brooks
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I heard all about it [G]dear Charlie
I knew it would end this way
I hope you will always live happy
With your loving little wife Miss Gray
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Now here’s your ring [G]dear Charlie
Don’t give it to her I pray
Unless you tell her twas once mine
I wore it one year today
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
One year today [G]dear Charlie
So happy were we both
You vowed you’d never forsake [G]me
But I find you untrue to your oath
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Here’s your picture [G]dear Charlie
It’s almost faded away
Because I kissed it so often
And this you can tell Miss Gray
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
As far as your letters [G]dear Charlie
I burned them as they came
I feared by reading them over
Would cause our love to inflame
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 9}
I must say goodbye [G]dear Charlie
My letter is near an end
Remember I’m always and always
Forever and ever your friend
{end_of_verse}
