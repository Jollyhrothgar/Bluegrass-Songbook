[G]Dear Nellie since I left the city

Or [C]do [G]me the [D]least [G]unkind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G]I think we’re both mistaken
I [C]know you’ll never suit [G]me
I owe my heart [G]to another
Of [C]course kind [D]friends will [G]agree
{end_of_verse}

Please send [G]me my ring and pictures
[C]Also my letters and [G]books
My clothes with [G]many kind wishes
[C]Respectfully [D]yours Charlie [G]Brooks

{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Here’s your picture [G]dear Charlie
It’s [C]almost faded [G]away
Because I kissed [G]it so often
And [C]this [G]you can [D]tell [G]Miss Gray
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
As far as your letters [G]dear Charlie
