{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
For fear the [E]hearts of men are failing,
For these are [A]latter days we [E]know
The Great [A]Depression now is [E]spreading,
God’s word declared it would be [E]so
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
I’m going [E]where there’s no depression,
To the lovely [A]land that’s free from [E]care
I’ll leave this world [A]of toil and [E]trouble,
My home’s in [B7]Heaven, I’m going [E]there
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
In that bright [A]land, there’ll be no hunger,
No orphan [A]children crying [E]for bread,
No weeping [A]widows, toil or [E]struggle,
No shrouds, no coffins, and no [E]death
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
This dark [E]hour of midnight nearing
And [A]tribulation time will [E]come
The storms will [A]hurl in midnight [E]fear
And sweep lost millions to their [E]doom
{end_of_verse}
