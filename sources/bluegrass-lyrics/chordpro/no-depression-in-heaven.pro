{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
For fear the hearts of men are failing,
For these are latter days we know
The Great Depression now is spreading,
God’s word declared it would be so
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
I’m going where there’s no depression,
To the lovely land that’s free from care
I’ll leave this world of toil and trouble,
My home’s in Heaven, I’m going there
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
In that bright land, there’ll be no hunger,
No orphan children crying for bread,
No weeping widows, toil or struggle,
No shrouds, no coffins, and no death
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
This dark hour of midnight nearing
And tribulation time will come
The storms will hurl in midnight fear
And sweep lost millions to their doom
{end_of_verse}
