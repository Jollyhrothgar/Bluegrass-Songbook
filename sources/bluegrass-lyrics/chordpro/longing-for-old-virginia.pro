{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
‘Mid the [G]green fields of [D]Virginia, dear I [G]met [G]you
Where the [D]roses red and white around us [G]grew
When I [C]held [G]you in my arms and gently [G]kissed [G]you
The [D]robins sang the sweetest song we knew
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I am [G]longing for old [D]Virginia, for old [D]Virginia and [G]you
And I’m [D]hoping the soul [G]within [G]you is [G]longing for me [D]too
To [D]Virginia, just like the ivy, my [C]heart clings ever [G]true
And I [C]reckon in the spring I’ll [G]bring a little ring
To old [D]Virginia and [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Though tonight I’m far from [G]you and old [D]Virginia
I still love [G]you as I did that day in June
And when springtime comes again to old [D]Virginia
I’ll build a little cottage just for two
{end_of_verse}
