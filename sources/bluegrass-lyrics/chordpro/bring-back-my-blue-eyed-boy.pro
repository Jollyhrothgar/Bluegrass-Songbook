{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Tis true the rain that has no end
It’s hard to find a faithful friend
And when you find one just and true
He’s dropped the old one for the new
Bring back my blue eyed boy to me
Bring back my blue eyed boy to me
Bring back my blue eyed boy to me
That I may ever happy be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Must I go bound and have no free
Must I love a boy that don’t love me
Or must I act the childish part
And love that boy that broke my heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Last night my lover promised me
To take me across the deep blue sea
And now he’s gone and left me alone
An orphan girl without a home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
O dig my grave both wide and deep
Place marble at my head and feet
And on my breast a snow white dove
To show to the world I died for love
{end_of_verse}
