{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[D]As I walked out one morning [A]fair
To view the fields and taste the [D]air
For to view the fields and nettles [A]around
I thought I heard some lonesome [D]sound
O thought I heard my true love [A]say
O do turn and come this [D]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[D]You love some other and you don’t [A]love me
You care not for my [D]company
You love some other and I know [A]why
Because he has more gold than [D]I
But gold will melt and silver [A]will fly
My love for you will [D]never die
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[D]There is a flower I’ve heard them [A]say
That can be seen from day to [D]day
And if that flower I only [A]could find
To cure this aching heart of [D]mine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[D]So fare you well my charming [A]little love
O meet me in that land [D]above
And when we meet there in that [D]land
We’ll take no more this parting [D]hand
{end_of_verse}
