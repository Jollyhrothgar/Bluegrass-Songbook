{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
My [G]mother died when I was young
My [D]sisters they were [G]sad
They [G]lay there hands upon my head
And ought me how to [G]pray
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
So [G]now my [G]mother she’s [C]gone to rest
In the [G]land of purist [D]joy
And I [G]wonder if she thinks of me
Her [D]poor little orphan [G]boy
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
When [G]I was only two years old
I [D]never shall [G]forget
A [D]parting kiss she gave to me
I sometimes feel it [G]yet
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
When [G]I was sick and every hour
She [D]watched me as I [G]lay
And with her kind [G]and gentle hand
She soothed me [G]tenderly
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
So [G]now I press this world alone
Her [D]love with me shall [G]stay
[G]And from the throne above the skies
Her smiles shall rest on [G]me
{end_of_verse}
