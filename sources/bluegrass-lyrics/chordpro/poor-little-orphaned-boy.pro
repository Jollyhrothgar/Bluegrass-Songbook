My [G]mother died when I was young
My [D]sisters they were [G]sad
They lay there hands upon my head
And ought me how to [G]pray

{start_of_chorus}
So [G]now my [G]mother she’s [C]gone to rest
In the [G]land of purist [D]joy
And I [G]wonder if she thinks of me
Her [D]poor little orphan [G]boy
{end_of_chorus}

When I was only two years old
I never shall forget
A parting kiss she gave to me
I sometimes feel it yet

When I was sick and every hour
She watched me as I lay
And with her kind and gentle hand
She soothed me tenderly

So [G]now I press this world alone
Her love with me shall stay
And from the throne above the skies
Her smiles shall rest on me
