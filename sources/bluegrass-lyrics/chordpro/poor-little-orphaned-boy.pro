{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]My mother died when I was young
My [D]sisters they were [G]sad
[G]They lay there hands [D]upon my head
And ought me how to [G]pray
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
[G]So now my [G]mother she’s [C]gone to rest
In the [G]land of purist [D]joy
And I [G]wonder if she thinks of me
Her [D]poor little orphan [G]boy
{end_of_chorus}

[G]When I was only two years old
I [D]never shall [G]forget
[G]A parting kiss [G]she gave to me
I sometimes feel it [G]yet
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G]When I was sick and every hour
She [D]watched me as I [G]lay
[G]And with her kind [C]and gentle hand
She soothed me [G]tenderly
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[G]So now I press this world alone
Her [D]love with me shall [G]stay
[G]And from the [D]throne above the skies
Her smiles shall rest on [G]me
{end_of_verse}
