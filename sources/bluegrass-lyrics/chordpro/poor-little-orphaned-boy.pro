{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
My mother died when I was young
My sisters they were sad
They lay there hands upon my head
And ought me how to pray
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
So now my mother she’s gone to rest
In the land of purist joy
And I wonder if she thinks of me
Her poor little orphan boy
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
When I was only two years old
I never shall forget
A parting kiss she gave to me
I sometimes feel it yet
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
When I was sick and every hour
She watched me as I lay
And with her kind and gentle hand
She soothed me tenderly
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
So now I press this world alone
Her love with me shall stay
And from the throne above the skies
Her smiles shall rest on me
{end_of_verse}
