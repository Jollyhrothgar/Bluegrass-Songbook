{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
You have heard of little Moses in the bull rush
You have heard of fearless David and his sling
You have heard the story told of dreaming Joseph
And of Jonah and the whale you often sing
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
There is going to be a meeting in the air
In that sweet sweet by and by
I am going to meet you meet you over there
In that home beyond the sky
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus}
The singing you will hear never heard by mortals ears
Will be glorious I do declare
And God’s own son will be the leading one
At that meeting in the air
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
There are many many others through the bible
I should like to meet them all I do declare
By and by the lord will surely let us meet them
At that meeting in the air
{end_of_verse}
