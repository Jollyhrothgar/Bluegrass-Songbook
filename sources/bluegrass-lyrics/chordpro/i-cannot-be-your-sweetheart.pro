{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Last night I told my heart’s love
All under the pale blue sky
Eagerly waiting an answer
I plainly could read in her eyes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I love you sweetheart I love
And ask you to be my bride
Her face turned pale and she trembled
And sadly to me she replied
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
I cannot be your sweetheart
I cannot stay by your side
One is waiting up yonder
One that’s claiming his bride
My heart is almost broken
Your vows only add to my pain
I love you sweetheart I love you
Though we may never meet again
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
We said goodbye in the moonlight
My heart was turned to stone
One blissful hour was made happy
But now I’m sad and alone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
In this my sorrows forever
Though you may go far away
Where ever you go I’ll love you
But still I can hear you say
{end_of_verse}
