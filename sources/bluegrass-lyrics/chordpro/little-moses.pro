{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[A]Away by the waters so blue
The ladies were [E]winding their [A]way
While [E]Pharaoh’s little daughter went down to the water
To [A]bathe in the [E]cool of the [A]day
[A]Before it was dark she opened the ark
And [E]found the sweet babe that was [A]there
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And [A]away by the waters so blue
The infant [E]was lonely [A]and sad
[E]She took him in pity and thought him so pretty
And [A]it made [E]little Moses so [A]glad
[A]She called him her own, her beautiful son
And [E]she sent for a nurse who [A]was near
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And [A]away by the waters so blue
They carried [E]that [A]beautiful child
To [E]his tender mother, to his sister and brothers
[A]Little Moses looked [E]happy and [A]smiled
[A]His mother so good did all that she could
To [E]raise him and teach him with [A]care
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
And [A]away by the sea that was red
Little Moses [E]the servant [A]of God
While [E]in him confided, the sea was divided
As [A]upwards he [E]lifted his [A]rod
And the Jews safely crossed while [E]Pharaoh’s host
Was [E]drownded in the waters [A]and lost
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
And [A]away on a mountain so high
The last that [E]he ever [A]did see
With [E]Israel victorious, his hopes were most glorious
That [A]soon all the [E]Jordan be [A]free
[A]When his spirit did cease, he departed in peace
And [E]rested in the Heavens [A]above
{end_of_verse}
