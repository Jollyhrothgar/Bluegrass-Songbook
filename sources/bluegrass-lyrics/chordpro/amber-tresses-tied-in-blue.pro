{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[D]Far away in some deep mountain
[D]Where the merry sunbeams [A]play
[D]There I wandered thru the [G]clover
[A]Singing to a village [D]maid
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
[A]She was dearer than the [D]dearest
Ever loving kind [D]and [A]true
[D]And [A]she wore beneath her [G]bonnet
[A]Amber tresses tied in [D]blue
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[D]Fact decreed that we parted
[D]When the leaves of autumn [A]fell
[D]Then two hearts were [G]separated
[A]That had loved each [D]other well
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[A]She was all I had to cherish
Every loving king [D]and [A]true
[D]Now I see in every [G]vision
[A]Amber tresses tied in [D]blue
{end_of_verse}
