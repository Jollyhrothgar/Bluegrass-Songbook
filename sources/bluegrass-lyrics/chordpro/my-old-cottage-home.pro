{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[F#]I am thinking tonight of an [B]old cottage home
[F#]That [F#]stands on the brow of the [C#]hill
Where in [F#]life’s early morning [F#]I [B]once loved to roam
But [F#]now all is [C#]quiet and [F#]still
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
[F#]Oh my [B]old cottage home my [B]old cottage home
[F#]That [F#]stands on the brow of the [C#]hill
Where in [F#]life’s early morning [F#]I [B]once loved to roam
But [F#]now all is [C#]quiet and [F#]still
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F#]Many years have gone by since in prayer there [F#]I knelt
With dear ones around the [B]old hearth
But my mother’s sweet prayers in my heart [F#]still are felt
[F#]I’ll treasure [C#]them awhile on [F#]earth
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F#]One by one they have gone from the [B]old cottage home
[F#]On [F#]earth we shall see them no [C#]more
But we’ll meet them again on [F#]that beautiful shore
Where [F#]partings will [C#]come never [F#]more
{end_of_verse}
