{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Come [A]back to me [E]in my dreaming
Come [A]back to me once [A]more
Come with the love light beaming
Like [E]in the days of yore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I wonder if [A]you still love me
And if your heart is still [A]true
When the spring roses are blooming
Then [E]I’ll come [A]back to [A]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Somewhere a heart is breaking
Calling me [A]back to [A]you
Memories of loved ones waiting
Each happy home and [A]you
Absence makes my heart fonder
Is it the same with [A]you
Are [A]you still happy I wonder
Or do [A]you feel lonesome too
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[A]When the sun [E]is sinking
[E]In the golden west
And the birds and flowers
[E]They have gone to rest
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Come [A]tell me [D]that [A]you still love me
And [D]that your heart is still [A]true
When the spring roses are blooming
Then [E]I’ll come [A]back to [A]you
{end_of_verse}
