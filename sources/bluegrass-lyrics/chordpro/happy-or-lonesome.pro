{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Come back to me in my dreaming
Come back to me once more
Come with the love light beaming
Like in the days of yore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I wonder if you still love me
And if your heart is still true
When the spring roses are blooming
Then I’ll come back to you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Somewhere a heart is breaking
Calling me back to you
Memories of loved ones waiting
Each happy home and you
Absence makes my heart fonder
Is it the same with you
Are you still happy I wonder
Or do you feel lonesome too
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
When the sun is sinking
In the golden west
And the birds and flowers
They have gone to rest
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Come tell me that you still love me
And that your heart is still true
When the spring roses are blooming
Then I’ll come back to you
{end_of_verse}
