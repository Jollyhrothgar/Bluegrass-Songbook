{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
At my window sad and lonely
Often do I think of you
And I wonder little darling
If you’re thinking of me to
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Don’t forget me little darling
When from you I’m far away
But remember little darling
We may meet again someday
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You may meet with fairer faces
Some may tell you I’m not true
Don’t believe them little darling
No one loves you as I do
{end_of_verse}
