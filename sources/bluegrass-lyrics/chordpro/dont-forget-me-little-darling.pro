{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[E]At my window sad and [A]lonely
[B7]Often do I think of [E]you
And I [A]wonder little [A]darling
[B7]If you’re thinking of me [E]to
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Don’t forget me little [A]darling
[B7]When from [E]you I’m far [E]away
But remember little [A]darling
[B7]We may meet again someday
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[E]You may meet with fairer faces
Some may tell [E]you I’m not true
Don’t believe them little [A]darling
No one loves [E]you as I do
{end_of_verse}
