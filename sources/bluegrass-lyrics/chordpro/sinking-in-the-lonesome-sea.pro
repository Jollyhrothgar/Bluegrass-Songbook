{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[D]There was a little ship
And it [D]sailed upon the [D]sea
And she went by the name of the [G]Merry Golden Tree
And she [D]sailed upon the low and [A7]lonesome low
And she [D]sailed upon the [A7]lonesome [D]sea
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}

If I sink them in the low and [A7]lonesome low
If I sink them in the [A7]lonesome [D]sea
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Two hundred dollars
I will give unto thee
And my oldest daughter I will wed unto you
If you sink them in the low and [A7]lonesome low
If you sink them in the [A7]lonesome [D]sea

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
He bowed upon his breast
And away swim he
Till he came the ship of the Turkish Reveille
As she [D]sailed upon the low and [A7]lonesome low
As she [D]sailed upon the [A7]lonesome [D]sea
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
If it wasn’t for the love
Of your daughter and your men
I would do unto you as I did unto them
I would sink you in the low and [A7]lonesome low
I would sink you in the [A7]lonesome [D]sea
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
He bowed his head
And down sank he
Farewell farewell to the [G]Merry Golden Tree
For I’m sinking in the low and [A7]lonesome low
For I’m sinking in the [A7]lonesome [D]sea
{end_of_verse}
