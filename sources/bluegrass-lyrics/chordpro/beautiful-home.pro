{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
There’s a beautiful home far over the sea
With mansions of bliss for you and for me
A beautiful home so wondrously fair
That the savior for me has gone to prepare
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
There’s a beautiful home (a beautiful home)
far over the sea (far over the sea)
There’s a beautiful home (a beautiful home)
for you and for me (for you and for me)
Its glittering powers (its glittering powers)
of sun out shine (of sun out shine)
That beautiful home (that beautiful home)
someday shall be mine  (someday shall be mine)
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
In that beautiful home a crown I shall wear
With the glorified throng their stories to share
But the doors of that home can never be known
Til the savior we see upon His white throne
{end_of_verse}
