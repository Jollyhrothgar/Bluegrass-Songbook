{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
When [G]we first met I was young and poor
I k[C]new just what I was working for
But the t[G]imes have changed and [D]so have you, I s[G]ee
Well, I was m[G]aking money, you were making time
But y[C]ou can bet I won't stand in line
If you [G]leave me it's like m[D]oney in the [G]bank
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
So, chalk[G] it up, mark it down, look [C]for me, I won't be around[G]
If you l[G]eave me it's like m[D]oney in the b[G]ank
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Well, there's o[G]ther girls that'll treat me right
And m[C]ake it home before daylight
They will [G]love me for who I [D]am and not what I b[G]uy
Well, when the c[G]ards are down and the table's turned
It will [C]be too late for you to learn
My l[G]ove's worth more than mo[D]ney in the b[G]ank
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
So, chalk[G] it up, mark it down, look [C]for me, I won't be around[G]
If you l[G]eave me it's like m[D]oney in the b[G]ank
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus}
So, chalk[G] it up, mark it down, I’ll [C]be no where to be found[G]
If you l[G]eave me it's like m[D]oney in the b[G]ank
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Outro}
If you [G]leave me it's like [D]money in the [G]bank
{end_of_verse}
