{start_of_chorus}
[G]In the gravel yard, with a [C]number for my [G]name
Making little rocks out of [D]big rocks all [G]day
Oh, the work is mighty hard [C]in the gravel [G]yard
I'll never be a [D]free man, so they [G]say.

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Warden hear my plea, [C]listen now to m[G]e
I killed a man that I [D]caught with my [G]wife
You'd probably do the same, so [C]why am I to [G]blame
Sentenced to the [D]rest of my [G]life

[G]In the gravel yard, with a [C]number for my [G]name

[G]In the driven rain with a [C]ball and [G]chain
My hammer rings a low and [D]mournful [G]sound
I sing a little song for the [C]one who done me [G]wrong
She’s lyin’ in the [D]cold, cold [G]ground
