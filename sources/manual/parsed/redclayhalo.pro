{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Well, the [C]girls all dance with the boys from the city   
But they don't care to dance with [G]me.   
Well, it [C]ain't my fault that the fields are muddy   
And the [G]red clay stains my [C]feet.   
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
It's [C]under my nails, and it's under my collar,   
And it shows on my Sunday [G]clothes.
Though I [C]do my best with soap and water,   
That [G]dammed old dirt won't [C]go.    
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus: Chorus}
But [F]when I pass through the [C]pearly gates
Will my [G]gown be gold in[C]stead,
Or just a [F]red clay robe with [C]red clay wings
And a [G]red clay halo for my [C]head?

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
It's [C]mud in the spring and it's dust in the summer   
When it rolls in crimson [G]tide   [G]
Till the [C]trees and leaves and the [G]cows are the color   
Of the [G]dirt on the mountain[C]side.

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Now, [C]Jordan's banks are red and muddy,   
And the rolling water is [G]wide,
But I [C]got no boat, so I'll be good and muddy   
When I [G]get to the other [C]side.   
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus: Chorus}
But [F]when I pass through the [C]pearly gates
Will my [G]gown be gold in[C]stead?
I'll take a [F]red clay robe and [C]red clay wings
And a [G]red clay halo for my [C]head
{end_of_chorus}
