[Intro]
C     G   C
 
 
[Verse 1]
C                             F         C
My name's John McArthur and I work this dirt
                                  F        C
Till they lay me down in it in my one good shirt
                            F          Am
I kept my family fed with a mule and a plow
                                      G          C
I'm a whisper in the wind through the pine trees now
 
 
[Chorus]
            G                     C
And my bloodline, it bled on this ground
            G           C
Soon we all find that's where we're bound
           F                       C
And Father Time don't leave anyone out
                  G                       C
And when you pass on, what you gonna pass down?
 
 
[Verse 2]
C                         F           C
I'm Junior McArthur and I join my old man
                      F   C
By way of a bullet in Vietnam
                            F         Am
Left behind my woman and my boy named Jones
F                              G        C
Never got to meet him but he's carrying on
 
 
[Chorus]
        G                      C
My bloodline that bled on this ground
            G           C
Soon we all find that's where we're bound
           F                       C
And Father Time don't leave anyone out
                  G                       C
And when you pass on, what you gonna pass down?
 
 
[Interlude]
C     G    C
 
 
[Verse 3]
C                        F          C
I'm Jones McArthur and I tried like hell
                      F         C
To teach my son why a man don't sell
                                     F      Am
But he came home from college seeing dollar signs
       F                      G            C
Didn't wanna go to work, just wanted me to die
 
 
[Verse 4]
        C
And I'm Hunter McArthur and the deal looks good
C
In eighteen months this'll be a neighborhood
                                               Am
I got a million dollar line I can sign my name on
              F                           G          C
But there's a whisper in the pines that's tellin' me don't
 
 
[Chorus]
               G                     C
Sayin' my bloodline, it bled on this ground
            G           C
Soon we all find that's where we're bound
           F                       C
And Father Time don't leave anyone out
                  G                       C
And when you pass on, what you gonna pass down?
 
 
[Outro]
                  G                   F
And when you pass on, what you gonna pass down?
F
Gonna pass down?
F
Gonna pass down?
              C    F C    G   C
Gonna pass down?
