[Intro]
Am  Dsus2  Am
Am  Dsus2  Am
Am  Dsus2  Am
Am  Dsus2  Am
Am  Dsus2  Am  F  F F G
 
[Verse 1]
           Am
There's an answer here if I look hard enough
                                            G
There's a reason why I always reach for the harder stuff
             Am
It wasn't my daddy's way. He was down in the mines all day
                                                  G
And though he wanted more than mouths to feed and bills to pay
 
[Chorus 1]
F                                     C     G
Maybe the Cumberland Gap just swallows you whole
F                                     C     G
Maybe the Cumberland Gap just swallows you whole
 
[Verse 2]
            Am
I ain't cut out for war, unless I know what I'm fightin' for
                                                  G
And there's nothing here but churches, bars and grocery stores
                 Am
There ain't much money in the old-time mandolin
                                               G
So I cash my check and I drink till I'm on my ass again
 
[Chorus 2]
F                                     C     G
Maybe the Cumberland Gap just swallows you whole
F                                     C     G
Maybe the Cumberland Gap just swallows you whole
F                                     C     G
Maybe the Cumberland Gap just swallows you whole
 
[Bridge]
Bb                                C
   Remember when we could see the mountain's peak?
Bb                           C
   The sparkle off the amphibole?
Bb                       C
   Like a giant golden eagle's beak
Bb                                G
   Now they say no one wants the coal
 
[Verse 3]
                Am
I thought about moving away, but what would my mama say?
                                           G
I'm all that she has left and I'm with her every day
               Am
As soon as the sun goes down, I find my way to the Mustang Lounge
                                                       G
And if you don't sit facing the window you could be in any town
 
[Chorus 3]
F                                     C     G
Maybe the Cumberland Gap just swallows you whole
F                                     C     G
Maybe the Cumberland Gap just swallows you whole
F                                     C     G
Maybe the Cumberland Gap just swallows you whole
F                                     C     G
Maybe the Cumberland Gap just swallows you whole
 
[Outro]
Am  Am  Am
