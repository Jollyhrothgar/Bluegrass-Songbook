I CAN'T THINK OF ONE
SONNY BURGESS
HAVE YOU GOT A SONG LIKE THAT?

E
THERE MUST BE A HUNDRED MILLION DIFFERENT REASONS WHY
                                         A
STAYIN HERE LOVIN YOU CANT BE RIGHT, BUT TONIGHT
       E
I CANT THINK OF ONE

THERE'S A LOT OF PLACES THAT I NEED TO BE
THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE I NEED TO GO AND SEE, BUT RIGHT NOW
I CANT THINK OF ONE

      C#m                     A
I CAN COME UP WITH A MILLION, FEELINS THAT IM FEELIN
  E
I WANNA DO WITH YOU TONIGHT
    C#m                         A
BUT ALL THOSE LITTLE REASONS, I THOUGHT I HAD FOR LEAVIN
     F#m                   B
HAVE ALL SEEMED TO SLIP MY MIND

SO SLIDE A LITTLE CLOSER OVER NEXT TO ME

IF THERE'S A BETTER PLACE ON EARTH I COULD BE, I SWEAR
I CANT THINK OF ONE

SOLO

I CAN COME UP WITH A MILLION, FEELINS THAT IM FEELIN
I WANNA DO WITH YOU RIGHT NOW
BUT ALL THOSE STUPID REASONS, I THOUGHT I HAD FOR LEAVIN
ESCAPED MY MIND SOMEHOW

IVE SAID IT ALL BEFORE BUT EVERY WORD IS TRUE
IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT I DON'T LOVE ABOUT YOU, OH GIRL
I CANT THINK OF ONE

  A                      E
I SWEAR, I CANT THINK OF ONE
