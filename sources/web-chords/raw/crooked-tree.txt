[Intro]
| G              | G              |
 
[Verse 1]
G                                G
Two trees in the forest, one was crooked, one was straight.
Em                                Em
Crimson bark and emerald needles, growing day by day.
    C                                       C
And though they looked so different, they enjoyed the rain the same,
        G             G
side by   side.
 
[Verse 2]
G                            G
Chickadee had told them of a darkness on the land.
Em                                  Em
Spinning blades that came to visit, carried by a man.
    C                               C
And every other tree would see them cut down where they stand,
   G              G
by   and by.
 
[Chorus]
              Em             C          G***                D
Oh, can't you see, a crooked tree won't fit into the mill machine.
                Em             C               G**         D*      G
They're left to grow, wild and   free. Oh, I'd rather be a crooked tree.
 
[Break]
| G              | G              | Em             | Em             |
| C              | C              | G              | G              |
 
[Verse 3]
    G                                  G
The perfect trees were driven down the mountain to the mill.
     Em                              Em
They turned them into toothpicks and twenty dollar bills.
   C                                    C
It seemed the more the people took, the more they needed still,
   G              G
in   the end.
 
[Verse 4]
    G                                    G
The crooked trees were left there, after all the work was done.
Em                              Em
Now they go for weeks and never witness anyone.
C                                    C
No one left to tell them, if they're growing right or wrong,
              G              G
but the whispering wind.
 
[Chorus]
              Em             C          G***                D
Oh, can't you see, a crooked tree won't fit into the mill machine.
                Em             C               G**         D*      G
They're left to grow, wild and   free. Oh, I'd rather be a crooked tree.
 
[Break]
| G              | G              | Em             | Em             |
| C              | C              | G              | G              |
 
[Verse 5]
G                                G
People say I'm different, and my way of life seems strange.
  Em                                       Em
I took the road less travelled, twists and turns along the way.
    C                                  C
But like the crooked tree, I'm growing stronger day by day
              G              G
as the clouds roll by.
 
[Verse 6]
  G                          G
A river never wonders why it flows around a bend.
  Em                               Em
A mountain doesn't question how it rose up from the land.
   C                         C
So who am I to wish I wasn't just the way I am,
       G
who am I.
 
[End-Chorus]
              Em             C          G***                D
Oh, can't you see, a crooked tree won't fit into the mill machine.
                Em             C               G**         D*      Em
They're left to grow, wild and   free. Oh, I'd rather be a crooked tree.
 
[Outro]
          C              G***            D
A crooked tree won't fit into the mill machine.
                Em             C               G**         D*      G
They're left to grow, wild and   free. Oh, I'd rather be a crooked tree.
    G**         D*     (G)
I'd rather be a crooked tree...
 
[Outro 1]

| C              | C              | G              | G              |
