[Verse 1]
D7                      D7
Ah, let me tell you people
D7                     D7
About this Blackjack game
D7                             D7
It's caused me nothing but trouble
D7                         D7
And I've only myself to blame
 
[Chorus]
G7            G7
Hey hey hey, yeah
G7                       D7
How unlucky can one man be?
D7     A7
Well, every quarter I get now
G7                                 D7
Lord, Blackjack takes it away from me
D7                                 A7
 
[Verse 2]
D7                           D7
My friends don't come around me
D7                      D7
Because I've been so blind
D7                       D7
I can't even borrow a nickel
D7                        D7
Now I've almost lost my mind
 
[Chorus]
G7              G7
Hey- hey- hey, yeah
G7                      D7
How unlucky can one man be?
D7     A7
Well, every quarter I get
G7                                D7
Lord, Blackjack takes it away from me
D7                                A7
 
[Verse 3]
D7                    D7
I sat there with two tens
D7                    D7
I thought I'd have some fun
D7                    D7
The dealer hit sixteen with a five
D7                          D7
Just enough to make twenty- one
 
[Chorus]
G7                   G7
Hey- hey- hey, yeah yeah
G7                      D7
How unlucky can one man be?
D7    A7
Well, every quarter I get
A7     G7                          D7
Yeah, Blackjack takes it away from me
D7                            D#7  D7
