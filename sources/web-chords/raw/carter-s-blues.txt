[(intro) ]D A D 

                        D                         A 
    As I walked out one morning fair, 
                                                      D 
    to view the fields and taste the air, 
                                                           A 
    for to view the fields and nettles around, 
                                                            D 
    I thought I heard some lonesome sound. 
                                                     A 
    I thought I heard my true love say, 
                                               D 
    oh do turn and come this way. 

( D A A7 D D A D ) 

                              D                               A 
    You love some other, you don’t love me, 
                                               D 
    you care not for my company. 
                                                          A 
    You love some other and I know why, 
                                                      D 
    because he has more gold than I. 
                                                       A 
    But gold will melt and silver will fly, 
                                               D 
    my love for you will never die. 

( D A A7 D D A D ) 

                        D                                A 
   There is a flower I’ve heard them say 
                                                     D 
    that can be seen from day to day, 
                                                    A 
    and if that flower I only could find 
                                                  D 
    to cure this aching heart of mine. 

( D A A7 D D A D ) 

                          D                                A 
    So fare you well my charming little love, 
                                               D 
    oh meet me in that land above. 
                                                        A 
    And when we meet there in that land, 
                                                       D 
    we’ll take no more this parting hand.
