[Intro]
G G C C D D7 G G G
 
[Chorus]
         D     D7         G
There'll be no detours in heaven
A7                       D
No rough roads along the way
    G        G7          C
I'm using my Bible for a roadmap
        D       D7                G
My last stop is heaven some sweet day
 
    G        G7          C
I'm using my Bible for a roadmap
             D               D7              G
The Ten Com- mandments, they tell me what to do
                G7            C
The twelve dis- ciples are my road signs
    D          D7             G
And Jesus will take me safely through
 
[Chorus]
         D     D7         G
There'll be no detours in heaven
A7                       D
No rough roads along the way
    G        G7          C
I'm using my Bible for a roadmap
        D       D7                G
My last stop is heaven some sweet day
 
[Inst]
G G7 C C D D7 G G x2
 
    G        G7           C
I'm using my Bible for my roadmap
    D           D7             G
The children of Israel used it too
                 G7             C
They crossed the Red Sea of de- struction
    D       D7                G
For God was there to see them through
 
[Chorus]
         D     D7         G
There'll be no detours in heaven
A7                       D
No rough roads along the way
    G        G7          C
I'm using my Bible for a roadmap
        D       D7                    G
My last stop is heaven --- some sweet day -----
