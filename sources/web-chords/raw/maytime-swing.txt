[Verse 1]
 
G                      G/F#                 Em
Days swiftly come and go, Im dreaming of her
                   Cadd9                   G
Shes seeing other guys, Emotions they stir
            G/F#                    Em
The sun is gone, The nights are long
          Cadd9
And I am left while the tears fall
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
G                  G/F#        Em
Did you think that I would cry
          Cadd9
On the phone?
G                G/F#         Em
Do you know what it feels like
            Cadd9
Being alone?
Em         C
I'll find someone new
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G
Swing, swing, swing
          G/F#
From the tangles of
         Em               Cadd9
My heart is crushed By a former love
 G        G/F#   Em    Cadd9
Can you help me find a way
 
To carry on again?
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
G                     G/F#
Dreams cast into the sky
 
Im moving on
Em                    Cadd9
Sweet beginnings do arise
 
She knows I was wrong
G                G/F#
The notes are old
                    Em
They bend, they fold
         Cadd9
And so do I to a new love
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
G                  G/F#        Em
Did you think that I would cry
          Cadd9
On the phone?
G                G/F#         Em
Do you know what it feels like
            Cadd9
Being alone?
Em         C
I'll find someone new
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G
Swing, swing, swing
          G/F#
From the tangles of
         Em               Cadd9
My heart is crushed By a former love
 G        G/F#   Em    Cadd9
Can you help me find a way
 
To carry on again?
 
 
[Instrumental]
 
G G/F# Em Cadd9 G G/F# Em Cadd9
 
 
[Bridge]
 
Em    D
Bury me
G                 Cadd9
(You thought your problems were gone)
Em    D
Carry me
Cadd9
(Away, away, away)
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G
Swing, swing, swing
          G/F#
From the tangles of
         Em               Cadd9
My heart is crushed By a former love
 G        G/F#   Em    Cadd9
Can you help me find a way
 
To carry on again?
 
 
Then just play the Chorus as many times as you like until the song ends
