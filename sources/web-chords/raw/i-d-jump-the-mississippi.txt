[Intro]
G C G D
G C G D G
 
[Verse 1]
G
I Been Lonely Much Too Long
C
I'd Give A yankee Dime If You'd Come Back Home
G                               D
Honey, Won't You Hug And Hold Me Tight
 
G
Tears keep A Fallin, My Eyes Are Blurred
C
If I Had The Wings Of A Pretty Little Bird
G                     D        G
I Would Fly Right To Your Arms Tonight.
 
[Chorus]
C
I'd Jump The Mississippi Deep And Wide
G
If You Was a Waitin On The Other Side
                                D
Honey Just To Hug And Hold You Tight
G
I'd Jump Across And Never Get Wet
C
Right There By Your Side I'd Set
G                D              G
Yes Indeed Everything Would Be Alright
 
[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
G
If You Would Come Back Home To Me
C
Make New Happy Like I Used To Be
G                          D
I'd Start Out And Meet You Halfway
 
G
I'd Leave Here And Never Look Back
C
I'd Run a Mile In a Minute Flat
G               D                  G
To get To You Before The End Of The Day
 
[Chorus]
C
I'd Jump The Mississippi Deep And Wide
G
If You Was a Waitin On The Other Side
                               D
Honey Just To Hug And Hold You Tight
 
G
I'd Jump Across And Never Get Wet
C
Right There By Your Side I'd Set
G            D                 G
Yes Indeed Everything Would Be Alright
