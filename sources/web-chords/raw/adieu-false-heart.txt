[Verse 1]
Am          Am
Adieu false heart, now we must part
Am                  Dm        Am
May the joys of the world go with you
Am
I love you long with a faithful heart
Am            Dm           Am
But never any more can I believe you
 
[Verse 2]
Am         Am
I seen the time I'd married you
Am             Dm       Am
And been your  constant lover
Am

Am            Dm            Am
For one whose heart  is tru er

Am            Am
You think you are too good for me
Am          Dm     Am
You think I am  forsaken
Am
But if you think I care for you
Am           Dm      Am
You are very much mistaken
 
[Verse 4]
Am         Am
My mind is like the constant sun
Am                   Dm         Am
From the east to the west it ranges
Am
But yours is like unto the moon
Am         Dm            Am
It's every month, it changes

[Verse 5]
Am          Am
When I lay down to take my rest
Am          Dm           Am
no scornful morn to wake me
Am
I'll go straight ways unto my grave
Am       Dm               Am
Just as fast as time can take me.

|Am  |Am  |Dm  Am  |Am  |  x2
