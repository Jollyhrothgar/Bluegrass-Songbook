[Chorus]
A
If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe
 
I'd been married long time ago
D
Where did you come from? Where did you go?
E
Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?
A
If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe
 
I'd been married long time ago
D
Where did you come from? Where did you go?
E
Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?
 
 
[Verse 1]
A
He came to town like a midwinter storm
D                             A
He rode through the fields so handsome and strong
A
His eyes was his tools and his smile was his gun
D                           E
But all he had come for was having some fun
 
 
[Chorus]
A
If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe
 
I'd been married long time ago
D
Where did you come from? Where did you go?
E
Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?
A
If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe
 
I'd been married long time ago
D
Where did you come from? Where did you go?
E
Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?

[Verse 2]
A
He brought disaster wherever he went
    D                          A
The hearts of the girls was to hell broken sent
A
They all ran away so nobody would know
    D                      E
And left only men cause of Cotton-Eye Joe
 
 
[Chorus]
A
If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe
 
I'd been married long time ago

Where did you come from? Where did you go?

Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?
A
If it hadn't been for Cotton-Eye Joe
 
I'd been married long time ago
D
Where did you come from? Where did you go?

Where did you come from, Cotton-Eye Joe?
