[Intro]
G D7 D7 C C G G
 
G              D
 In South Carolina
C                    G
 There are many tall pines
               D
I remember the oak tree
C                D     D7
 That we used to climb
                 C
But now when I'm lonesome,
D            G
 I always pretend
                     C
That I'm getting the feel
D           G    C  G
 Of hickory wind
 
G                 D
 I've started out younger
C             G
 Had most everything
                   D
All the riches and pleasures,
C                   D      D7
 What else can life bring?
                     C
But it makes me feel better
D              G
 Each time it begins
           C
Callin' me home,
D        G    C  G
 Hickory wind
 
D  C  G
 
G                   D
 It's a hard way to find out
C                G
 That trouble is real
              D
In a far away city,
C                D    D7
 With a far away feel
                     C
But it makes me feel better
D              G
 Each time it begins
            C
Callin' me home,
D        G    C  G
 Hickory wind
                 C
Keeps callin' me home,
D        G    C  G
 Hickory wind
