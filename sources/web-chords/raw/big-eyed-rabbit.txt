 D                               G
Yonder comes a rabbit, how do I know?

Fur is shinin’ in the sun, / Shinin’ bright like gold, gold; shinin’ bright like gold.

If I see another one, gonna / Shoot him with my gun, I’ll shoot him with my gun.

Yonder comes a rabbit, slippin’ through the sand,
                   D                                     A                      D
Shoot that rabbit, he don’t care, gonna / Fry him in my pan, I’ll fry him in my pan.

Big-eyed rabbit’s gone, boys, big-eyed rabbit’s gone; Big-eyed rabbit’s gone, boys, big-eyed rabbit’s gone.
