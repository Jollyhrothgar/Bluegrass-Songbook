[Verse 1]
C9
Oh, Limehouse kid
C9
Oh, oh, Limehouse kid
A7
Goin' the way That the rest of them did
G
Poor broken blossom
    B7         Em
And nobody's child
A7
Haunting and taunting
        D7
You're just kind of wild
 
[Verse 2]
C9
Oh, Limehouse blues
I've the real Limehouse blues
A7
Can't seem to shake off Those real China blues
G
Rings on your fingers
    B7             Em
And tears for your crown
A7
That is the story
   D7
Of old Chinatown
 
G
Rings on your fingers
    B7             Em
And tears for your crown
A7
That is the story
  D7
Of old Chinatown
