Intro:D G D A D G A D 

D                         G           D                                        A 
Far away in sunny mountains, where the merry sunbeams play, 
D                             G        A                     D 
there I wandered thru the clover, singing to a village maid. 
A                                  D                               A 
She was dearer than the dearest, ever loving kind and true, 
D                               G      A                           D 
and she wore beneath her bonnet amber tresses tied in blue. 

( D G D A D G A D ) 

D                             G       D                              A 
Fate decreed that we be parted, ere the leaves of autumn fell, 
D                             G       A                              D 
then two hearts were separated that had loved each other well. 
A                        D                                     A 
She was all I had to cherish, every loving kind and true, 
D                    G       A                        D 
now I see in every vision amber tresses tied in blue.

A                                  D                               A 
She was dearer than the dearest, ever loving kind and true, 
D                               G        A                        D 
and she wore beneath her bonnet amber tresses tied in blue.
