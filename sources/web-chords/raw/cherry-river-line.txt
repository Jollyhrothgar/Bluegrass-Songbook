C C Bb C
C F Bb C x2
 
[Chorus]
C                      Bb               C
It's lonely here, it's lonesome all the time
C                         F            Bb    C
It's lonesome on the cherry, cherry river line

[Verse 1]
C                                Bb
I had a girl on yonder mountain, she treated me so fine
C                  F            Bb           C
I went back to see her, she was always on my mind
C                        Bb
I found her with another beneath the spreading pine
C           F        Bb               C
Hugging and kissing, drinking cherry wine
 
[Chorus]
C                      Bb               C
It's lonely here, it's lonesome all the time
C                         F            Bb    C
It's lonesome on the cherry, cherry river line
 
[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
C                        Bb                C
Now she's gone away, she left me here to grieve
C                  F              Bb          C
Some other fellows got her in the metal robbery
C                                  Bb               C
This train that’s I’m riding, it’s pulling mighty slow
C                   F         Bb               C
I hate to hear that lonesome, lonesome whistle blow
 
[Chorus]
C                      Bb               C
It's lonely here, it's lonesome all the time
C                         F            Bb    C
It's lonesome on the cherry, cherry river line
 
[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
C                     Bb                   C
Someday I will forget you, no longer on my mind
C                F           Bb                C
But I will never forget that old cherry river line
 
[Chorus]
C                                Bb
It's lonely here, it's lonesome all the time
C                    F       Bb           C
It's lonesome on the cherry, cherry river line
