[Verse]
D                              G
I had a dream of you the other night dear
  A                              D
A dream I could not live in true life I fear
D                                   G
You talked with a friend of mine so lovingly
   A                                 D
Oh God, oh God, a crazy dream please let it be
 
 
[Chorus]
D                 G
Dreams, dreams of you dear
A                D
Tears, tears are so sincere
D                 G
Love, love that I can't hide
A                              D
These dreams are breakin' down all my pride
 
 
[Verse]
D                                          G
While music played he danced and held you, oh, so tight
A                                     D
The same way we did when our love was young and bright
D                                    G
Then he kissed you under lights that were so dim
A                                 D
I couldn't stand to see you there alone with him
 
 
[Chorus]
D                 G
Dreams, dreams of you dear
A                D
Tears, tears are so sincere
D                 G
Love, love that I can't hide
A                              D
These dreams are breakin' down all my pride
 
 
[Verse]
D                         G
I realize a dream is only fantasy
A                                    D
But tell me why these dreams seem so real to me
D                                G
Every night I have this same old misery
A                                   D
I guess it's just because of all my jealousy
 
 
[Chorus]
D                 G
Dreams, dreams of you dear
A                D
Tears, tears are so sincere
D                 G
Love, love that I can't hide
A                              D
These dreams are breakin' down all my pride
