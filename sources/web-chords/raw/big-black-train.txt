[INTRO]
N.C.                  G
Well, I had the blues
N.C.                  G
But now they're gone
N.C.                             C
I'm on a big black freight train
N.C.                G
And we're movin' on
 
[CHORUS]
G
I'm on a big black train and I'm movin' on
         C                       G
I'm on a big black train and I'll soon be gone
           D7                                G
Well, this big black train, it keeps movin' on
 
 
[VERSE 1]
G
Well, if you want me, baby, better get on the track
      C                   G
Got a one-way ticket and I won't be back
           D7
Well, this big black freight train
                              G
It's movin' down the railroad track
 
 
[VERSE 2]
G
Well, you cheated on me, baby, and you told me lies
              C                                G
You said that you was gonna laugh every time I cried
           D7
Well, this big black train
                       G
We're tellin' you goodbye
 
 
[CHORUS]
G
I'm on a big black train and I'm movin' on
         C                       G
I'm on a big black train and I'll soon be gone
           D7                                G
Well, this big black train, it keeps movin' on
