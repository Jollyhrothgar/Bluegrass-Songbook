"Little Birdy"
 
       D
Little birdy, little birdy
          A               D
Won't you sing to me your song
      D
Got a short time to stay here
      A               D
And a long time to be gone
 
 
           D
I'd rather be in some dark hollow
          A              D
Where the sun don't ever shine
         D
Than for you to be another man's darling
       A                        D
And to know that you'd never be mine
 
 
       D
Little birdy, little birdy
           A          D
What makes you fly so high
         D
When you know that my true lover
     A              D
Is a-waiting in the sky
 
 
      D
I'm a long way from old Dixie
       A            D
And my old Kentucky home
       D
Got no father or mother
   A                D
No place to call my home
 
       D
Little birdy, little birdy
           A            D
What makes your head so red
      D
Well, after all that I been through
       A              D
It's a wonder I ain't dead
 
 
        D
Married woman, married woman
          A          D
Why don't you settle down
             D
Your heart's like the little birdy's
       A            D
You're flying all a-round
 
 
       D
Little birdy, little birdy
          A               D
Won't you sing to me your song
       D
You've caused me lots of trouble
       A               D
You've caused me to do wrong
