[Intro]
 
Am  Am/F#  F  Cadd9  Cadd9/B
 
 
[Verse]
 
             Am                    Am/F#
I guess I've got a taste for poison
     F                      Cadd9  Cadd9/B
I've given up on ever being well
       Am                Am/F#
I keep mindin' the horizon
F                              Cadd9  Cadd9/B
Diggin' for lies I have yet to tell
    G+
And I wish you were here to softly say my name
F                                             Cadd9
Calm down all the chemicals tearin through my brain
        G+
I don't think I've missed you this much since I was seventeen
    F                              Cadd9
I'd call you in the morning, but I think this is a dream
F       Cadd9  Cadd9/B
Cherokee
Dm       Am  Cadd9/B
Cherokee
            F                    Cadd9  Cadd9/B  F
Well you'd carve those doubts right out of me
             Am                    Am/F#
I see you shining through the treetops
             F                      Cadd9  Cadd9/B
but I don't feel you pulling strings anymore
       Am                  Am/F#
I still use your old alarm clock
F                                  Cadd9  Cadd9/B
Every morning I get further off of course
G+
And don't I hear you speaking in the noises of this house
F                                             Cadd9
Airplanes flying over, shaking all my secrets out
G+
Darling tell me something that I don't already know
F                                    Cadd9
I'm aware of where to find you. It hurts too bad to go.
F       Cadd9  Cadd9/B
To Cherokee
Dm       Am  Cadd9/B
Cherokee            
                   F                    Cadd9  Cadd9/B  F
Well you'd carve those doubts right out of me
 
 
[Outro]
 
         G+
It felt like the world was burnin You had stars in your eyes
F                                          Cadd9
Shinin for a feelin that I can't afford to buy
G+
Everything you taught me still rattles in my head
     F                                         Cadd9
I'm stayin off of Main Street, you're talking to the dead
F       Cadd9  Cadd9/B
In Cherokee
Dm       Am  Cadd9/B
Cherokee
            F                    Cadd9  Cadd9/B  F
I wish you'd carve these doubts right out of me
