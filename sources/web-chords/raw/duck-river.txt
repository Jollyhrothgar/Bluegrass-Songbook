[Intro (with piano)]
 
C Am F G
 
[Verse 1]
 
     F         C
It's coming on Christmas
        F            C
They're cutting down trees
        F          C
They're putting up reindeer
            F       C
And singing songs of joy and peace
      Am                                G
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on
 
[Verse 2]
 
    F        C
But it don't snow here
   F            C
It stays pretty green
             F             C
I'm going to make a lot of money
                  F         C
Then I'm going to quit this crazy scene
      Am                                G
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on
 
[Chorus 1]
 
  F                     G
I wish I had a river so long
        C                F   Am   Dm   Dm7
I would teach my feet to fly----       wooh . .
  C                 G                   F
I wish I had a river I could skate away on
C         G    C
I made my baby cry
 
[Interlude]
 
C Am G
 
[Verse 3]
 
   F             C
He tried hard to help me
             F         C
You know, he put me at ease
       F           C
And he loved me so naughty
        F           C
Made me weak in the knees
      Am                                G
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on
 
[Verse 4]
 
    F          C
I'm so hard to handle
    F               C
I'm selfish and I'm sad
                  F             C
Now I've gone and lost the best baby
     F      C
That I ever had
      Am                                G
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on
 
[Chorus 2]
 
  F                     G
I wish I had a river so long
        C                F   Am   Dm   Dm7
I would teach my feet to fly----       whoa
  C                 G                   F
I wish I had a river I could skate away on
  C       G    C
I made my baby say goodbye

            F       C
And singing songs of joy and peace
