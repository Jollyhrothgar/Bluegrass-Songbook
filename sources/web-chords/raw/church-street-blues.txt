[Intro]
| C    F    | Am G C  |
| C    F    | Am G C  |
| C    F    | Am G C  |
| C    F    | Am G C  |

[Verse 1]
      C              F            Am       G        C
Well, I been hangin' out of town, in that low-down rain
C                   F                  Am     G     C
Watchin' good-time Charlie friend is drivin' me insane
C             F                        Am  G            C
Up on shady Charlotte Street all the green lights look red
  C                  F                  Am    G       C
I wish I's back home on the farm, Lordy in my feather bed
 
[Chorus]
       C     F      Am
And I got myself a rockin' chair
    G              C
To see if I could lose
       F   Em   Am      G
This thin, dime___ hard-time
F       G              C
Hell on Church Street blues
 
[Solo]
| C    F    | Am G C  |
| C    F    | Am G C  |
| C    F    | Am G C  |
| C    F    | Am G C  |
| C    F    | Am G C  |
| F Em Am G | F  G C  |
 
[Verse 2]
   C             F                    Am    G          C
I found myself a picker friend and I read yesterdays news
  C              F              Am       G     C
I folded up page twenty-one and stuck it in my shoe
  C                F               Am        G        C
I gave me a nickel to the poor, my good turn for the day
   C            F                 Am       G   C
I folded up my old billfold, and threw it far away
 
[Chorus]
       C     F      Am
And I got myself a rockin' chair
    G              C
To see if I could lose
       F   Em   Am      G
This thin, dime___ hard-time
F       G              C
Hell on Church Street blues.
 
[Solo]
| C    F    | Am G C  |
| C    F    | Am G C  |
| C    F    | Am G C  |
| C    F    | Am G C  |
| C    F    | Am G C  |
| F Em Am G | F  G C  |
 
[Verse 3]
       C              F               Am         G        C
And I wish I had some guitar strings, Old Black Diamond brand
     C                 F              Am     G         C
I'd string up this old Martin box and go and join some band
       C                 F                  Am       G        C
But I guess I'll go and stay right here and pick and sing a while
 C                 F               Am         G      C
Try to make me a little change and give them folks a smile
 
[Chorus]
       C     F      Am
And I got myself a rockin' chair
    G             C
To see if I could lose
       F   Em   Am      G
This thin, dime___ hard-time
F       G              C
Hell on Church Street blues.
 
[Solo]

| C    F    | Am G C  |
| C    F    | Am G C  |
| C    F    | Am G C  |
| F Em Am G | F  G C  |
 
[Outro]
       C           F
And I got myself a rockin' chair
    Am    G        C
To see if I could lose
       F   Em   Am      G
This thin, dime___ hard-times
F       G              C
Hell on Church Street blues
