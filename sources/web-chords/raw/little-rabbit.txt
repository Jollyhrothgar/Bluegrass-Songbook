[Intro]
G  C G Em  C G  Em  C G
 
 
[Verse 1]
G                       C       G
I could tell you that I want to know
G                         C       G
Ask you what you think of getting old
G                        C         G
Whisper close if I could hold your hand
 
 
[Refrain]
Em                           C       G
But I don't think that I can be your man
Em                       C       G
I don't think that I can be your man
 
G  C G Em  C G  Em  C G
 
 
[Verse 2]
G                             C        G
Something about the way your eyes meet mine
                         C       G
Makes me want to feel it all the time
                      C      G
Better sit down I can hardly stand
 
 
[Refrain]
Em                           C       G
But I don't think that I can be your man
Em                       C       G
I don't think that I can be your man
 
 
[Verse 3]
G                         C       G
I hope you will not think less of me
                       C      G
If you knew my sins you would agree
                        C      G
You're too pretty to be making plans
 
 
[Refrain]
Em                          C       G
So I don't think that I can be your man
Em                           C       G
No, I don't think that I can be your man
 
 
[Verse 4]
G                         C       G
Little rabbit, won't you lay with me?
                           C    G
Let's pretend the night is ours only
                             C      G
There is nothing you're less lovely than
 
 
[Refrain]
Em                           C       G
But I don't think that I can be your man
Em                           C       G
No, I don't think that I can be your man
Em                       C       G
I don't think that I can be your man
