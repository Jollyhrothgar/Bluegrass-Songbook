Caroline Herring - Midnight On The Water
 
 
 
INTRO: G     D  G    D  G      Am  Em  C  G       D  G
 
 
There are times when I am blue
            C       G
Thinking of you and me
      C            G
At midnight on the water
           D       G
And how it used to be
 
 
There are stars among the trees
             C          G
And some old memories I know
      C            G
At midnight on the water
       D     G
Not so long ago
 
 
They're gone like floating dreams
 
The scenes, where they're as in a mirror
            Am
Made by the moon upon the water
        Em             G
And our love was never stronger
    C
The picture was broken
       G
By the waves we left behind
      C            G
At midnight on the water
      D     G
Once upon a time
 
 
INSTRUMENTAL: G     Am   Em   C   G     D  G
 
 
 
There are times when I am blue
            C       G
Thinking of you and me
      C            G
At midnight on the water
           D       G
And how it used to be
 
 
 
In the stillness of the lake
                             C G
Where these thoughts take me again
      C            G
At midnight on the water
         D      G
Do you remember when
 
 
 
They're gone like floating dreams
 
The scenes, where they're as in a mirror
            Am
Made by the moon upon the water
        Em             G
And our love was never stronger
    C
The picture was broken
       G
By the waves we left behind
      C            G
At midnight on the water
      D     G
Once upon a time
 
 
OUTRO: G      Am   Em   C   G      D  G
