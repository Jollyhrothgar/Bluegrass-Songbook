[Intro]
NONE
 
 
[Verse]
C                              F
  Before I lived here on this haunted mountain
C                                         F
  I was walking through the valley on my own
C                        F
 Darkness all the way around me
C                     F         C
 I looked to the sky and saw you
                F                C   C  F
Wreathed all around in a golden cloud
 
 
[Chorus]
           F                 Em  G  Em  F
All of my life, I've been a rounder
                             C
Traveling across this green land
Am                         G        F
  But now that I live here on this haunted mountain
 
         C          F
I don't mind never coming down
    C         F         C
No I'm never coming down
           F             C  C  C
I'm never coming down again
 
 
[Verse]
       C               F
Every dewdrop on this haunted mountain
C                        F
 Is like a tiny crystal ball
C               F
 Early in the morning
C                        F     C
 I peer into the living leaves
          F                     C  C
And prophecy with the light of dawn
 
 
[Chorus]
F                             Em      F
 All of my life, I've been a rounder
                             C
Traveling across this green land
Am                         G        F
  But now that I live here on this haunted mountain
 
         C          F
I don't mind never coming down
    C         F         C
No I'm never coming down
           F             C  C  C
I'm never coming down again
 
 
[Verse]
             C                         F
I drank the water of this haunted mountain
C                                 F
 Saw a younger reflection in the falls
C                  F
 The river rose around me
C                      F   C
 I was swept up in an eddy
             F               C      C
I drifted a mile and nearly drowned
 
 
[Chorus]
F                             Em      F
 All of my life, I've been a rounder
                             C
Traveling across this green land
Am                                  F
  But now that I live here on this haunted mountain
 
         C              F
I don't mind I'm never coming down
    C         F         C
No I'm never coming down
           F             C  C
I'm never coming down again
