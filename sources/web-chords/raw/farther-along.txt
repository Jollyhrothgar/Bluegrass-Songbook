This is tabbed in the key of G major. Transpose how ever you like. I started playing it
G major and it worked. The chord changes may be off just a little bit, but it's close enough.
 
Verse 1
G                       C           G
Tempted and tried we're oft made to wonder
C             G        A           D
Why it should be thus all the day long
G                      C      G
While there are others living about us
C        G      D             G
Never molested though in the wrong
 
Chorus
G                   C         G
Farther along we'll know all about it
C        G          A          D
Farther along we'll understand why
G                   C           G
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
C           G       D          G
We'll understand it all by and by
 
Verse 2
G                       C         G
When death has come and taken our loved ones
C             G       A          D
It leaves our home so lonely and drear
G                 C          G
Then do we wonder why others prosper
C         G      D          G
Living so wicked year after year
 
Chorus
 
Verse 3
G                 C         G
When we see Jesus coming in Glory
C             G        A           D
When He comes from His home in the sky
G                      C              G
Then we shall meet Him in that bright mansion
C          G        D          G
We'll understand it all by and by
 
Chorus
