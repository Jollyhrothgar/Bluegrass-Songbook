[Intro]
D  G  D  A7  D
 
[Verse 1]
D                                                         G
There's a little mountain church in my thoughts of yesterday
      D                                   A
Where friends and family gathered for the Lord
         D                                                      G
There an old fashioned preacher taught the straight and narrow way
              D               A                  D
For what few coins the congregation could afford
 
[Verse 2]
                                                         G
Dressed in all our Sunday best we sat on pews of solid oak
      D                                  A
And I remember how our voices filled the air
           D                                           G
How momma sounded like an angel on those high soprano notes
         D                 A              D
When the roll is called up yonder I'll be there
 
[Chorus]
        Am7            D               G
Looking back now that little mountain church house
      D                       A
Has become my life's corner stone
       D             D7              G
It was there in that little mountain church house
        D                   A             D
I first heard the word I've based my life upon
 
[Instrumental]
D  G  D  A7  D  G  D  A7  D
 
[Verse 3]
                                                 G
At the all day Sunday singing and dinner on the ground
D                               A7
Many were the souls that were revived
         D                                                G
While my brothers and my sisters who've gone on to glory land
         D            A7              D
Slept in peace in the maple grove nearby
 
[Chorus]
        Am7            D              G
Looking back now that little mountain church house
      D                     A
Has become my life's corner stone
       D             D7              G
It was there in that little mountain church house
        D                   A              D
I first heard the word I've based my life upon
 
[Outro]
D  G  D  A7  D  G  D  A7  D
