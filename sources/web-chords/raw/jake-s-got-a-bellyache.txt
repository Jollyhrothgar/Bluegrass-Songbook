[Intro]
C       Am       Em
C  C/G  Am  Am*  Em  Em/B
 
[Verse 1]
C                C/G
Sittin' all alone
Am              Am*
Mouth full of gum
Em             Em/B  Em  Em/B*
In the driveway
C                   C/G
My friends aren't far
Am                   Am*
In the back of my car
Em              Em/B  Em  Em/B*
Lay their bodies
 
[Pre-Chorus]
           C C/G Am Am*
Where's my mind
           Em Em/B Em Em/B*
Where's my mind
 
[Verse 2]
C                       C/G
They'll be here pretty soon
Am                  Am*
Lookin' through my room
Em          Em/B  E  Em/B*
For the money
C                 C/G
I'm bitin' my nails
Am                        Am*
I'm too young to go to jail
Em             Em/B  Em  Em/B*
It's kinda funny
 
[Pre-Chorus]
           C C/G Am Am*
Where's my mind
           Em Em/B Em Em/B*
Where's my mind
           C C/G Am Am*
Where's my mind
           Em Em/B Em Em/B*
Where's my mind
 
[Chorus]
                  C
Maybe it's in the gutter
                Am
Where I left my lover
                  Em
What an expensive fake
             C
My V is for Vendetta
                      Am
Thought that I'd feel better
                        Em
But now I got a bellyache
 
[Verse 3]
C
Everything I do
Am
The way I wear my noose
Em
Like a necklace
C
I wanna make 'em scared
Am
Like I could be anywhere
                   Em
Like I'm wreck-less
 
[Pre-Chorus]
          C Am
I lost my mind
        Em
I don't mind
            C  Am
Where's my mind
           Em Em/B*
Where's my mind
 
[Chorus]
                  C
Maybe it's in the gutter
C/G              Am
 Where I left my lover
Am*                Em Em/B Em
 What an expensive fake
Em/B*         C
 My V is for Vendetta
C/G                    Am
 Thought that I'd feel better
Am*                        Em
 But now I got a bellyache
 
                  C
Maybe it's in the gutter
C/G              Am
 Where I left my lover
Am*                Em Em/B Em
 What an expensive fake
Em/B*         C
 My V is for Vendetta
C/G                    Am   Am*
 Thought that I'd feel better
N.C.
 But now I got a bellyache
