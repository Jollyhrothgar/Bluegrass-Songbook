[Intro]
 
E
(hold)
A E F# F# E E E F# E x4
(staccato) 
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
A               E          F#        E F#
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
A         E       F#   E F#
Somewhere in this town
A              E             F#      E F#
See me and the boys we don't like it
A               E            F#   E F#
So were getting up and going down
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
A          E                F#        E F#
Hiding low looking right to left
A          E                      F#        E F#
If you see us coming I think it's best
A            E                  F#        E F#
To move away do you hear what I say
A    E        F#        E F#
From under my breath
 
 
[Chorus]
 
B                          E
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
B                E
Somewhere in the town
B                          E
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
   A         G# F#
So don't you be around
A         E  F#        E F#
A         E  F#        E F#
Don't you be around
A          E                F#        E F#
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
A               E        F#        E F#
Tonight there's gonna be trouble
A          E     F#        E F#
Some of us won't survive
A       E                F#        E F#
See the boys and me mean business
A       E           F#        E F#
Bustin' out dead or alive
 
 
[Verse 4]
 
A     E                        F#        E F#
I can hear the hound dogs on my trail
A                      E                F#        E F#
All hell breaks loose, alarm and sirens wail
A             E      F#        E F#
Like the game if you lose
A      E          F#        E F#
Go to jail
 
 
[Chorus]
 
B                          E
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
B                E
Somewhere in the town
B                          E
Tonight there's gonna be a jailbreak
   A         G# F#
So don't you be around
 
B                     E
Tonight there's gonna trouble
B                     E
I'm gonna find myself in
B                        E
Tonight there's gonna be trouble
   A     G#          F#
So woman stay with a friend
   A     G#          F#
 
N.C.
You know it's safer

Tonight there's gonna be a breakout
A               E          F#        E F#
Into the city zones
A               E          F#        E F#
Don't you dare to try and stop us
A               E          F#        E F#
No one could for long
 
 
[Verse 6]
 
A           E     F#        E F#
Searchlight on my trail
A             E         F#           E F#
Tonight's the night all systems fail
A       E            F#        E F#
Hey you good lookin' female
A    E          F#        E F#
Come here!

B                E
Somewhere in the town

So woman stay with a friend
