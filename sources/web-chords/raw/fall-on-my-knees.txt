Down a 1/2 step to match https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axfp1ap3Su4
 
[Chorus]
E            A
I'm going to fall
           E
Down on my knees
              B7
And thank the Lord
                E
For bringing me peace
 
E         A
I lift my hands
            E
In His company
                B7
Oh you know I'm grateful
                E
For what He has done for me
 
[Verse 1 - single strum]
E
People always try to tell me
       E
Just do what you want to do
      E
But I try to rely on my mama's advice
       E
And it always got me through
 
     E
I've fallin short of Glory
   E
At least a time or two
E
Temptation all around me
       E
And Im reaching out to you
 
[Chorus]
E            A
I'm going to fall
           E
Down on my knees
              B7
And thank the Lord
                E
For bringing me peace
 
E         A
I lift my hands
            E
In His company
                B7
Oh you know I'm grateful
                E
For what He has done for me
 
[Verse 2 - single strum]
E
I've been barely making ends meet
        E
And I'm hardly scrapping by
E
Bills stacked on the table
     E
Been messing with my mind
 
      E
Oh I'm fightin worldy pressure
E
Like I've never had before
           E
But theres only one thing, that I can think to do
          E
Because I can't take no more
 
[Chorus]
E            A
I'm going to fall
           E
Down on my knees
              B7
And thank the Lord
                E
For bringing me peace
 
E         A
I lift my hands
            E
In His company, oh
                B7
Oh you know I'm grateful
                E
For what He has done for me
 
[Outro]
       A
Well, I praise the Lord
                  E
Oh, Lord I praise the Lord
                  B7
Well I praise the Lord
                  E
Well I praise the Lord
 
                  A
Well I praise the Lord
                 E
Oh, I praise the Lord
 
[tempo change]
                  B7
Well I praise the Lord
                  A
Well I praise the Lord
 
E
