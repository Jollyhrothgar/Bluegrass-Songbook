             Absus4           Ab
Well you can tell ev'ryone I'm a down disgrace
Gbsus4        Gb
Drag my name all over the place.
                    Ebm
I don't care anymore.
         Absus4             Ab
You can tell ev'rybody 'bout the state I'm in
          Gbsus4          Gb
You won't catch me crying 'cos I just can't win.
               Ebm
I don't care anymore
 
I don't care anymore
 
[Pre-Chorus 1]
            Db          Ebm
I don't care what you say
            Db                     Ebm
I don't play the same games you play.
 
[Chorus 1]
               Absus4                Ab
'Cos I've been talking to the people that you call your friends
        Gbsus4                Gb
And it seems to me there's a means to and end.
                      Ebm
They don't care anymore.
             Absus4     Ab
And as for me I can sit here and bide my time
      Gbsus4          Gb
I got nothing to lose if I speak my mind.
                    Ebm
I don't care anymore
 
I don't care no more
 
[Bridge 1]
            Db            Ebm
I don't care what you say
               Db                      Ebm
We never played by the same rules anyway.
 
[Verse 2]

And you laughed in my face 'cos you held all the cards.
                    Ebm
I don't care anymore.
      Absus4                    Ab
And I really ain't bothered what you think of me
