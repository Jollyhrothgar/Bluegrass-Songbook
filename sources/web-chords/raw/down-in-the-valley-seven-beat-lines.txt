[Intro]
 
F               C           Am            C     C
I wish I was a slave to an age-old trade
F                       C           Am            C     C
Like ridin' around on railcars and workin' long days
F                       C                   C
Lord have mercy on my rough and rowdy ways
F                      C                    C
Lord have mercy on my rough and rowdy ways
 
[Intro Again]
 
 
[Verse]
 
F                       C
Call it one drink too many
         Am         C     C
Call it pride of a man
        F             C                Am          C     C
But it don't make no difference if you sit or you stand
             F                N.C.  C                  C
'Cause they both end in trouble and start with a grin
          F                 N.C.  C                  C
Yeah they both end in trouble and start with a grin
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
          F        C        Am      C     C
We do it over and over and over again
          F        C       Am     C     C
We do it over and over and over again
 
F       Am      C       G
Oh      -oh     -oh     -oh (rhythm change) (straight strumming)
F       Am      C       G
Oh      -oh     -oh     -oh  (build)
F       Am      C       G
Oh      -oh     -oh     -oh
 
 
               F           Am
I know there's California, Oklahoma
    C                          G
And all of the places I ain't ever been to but
 
 
[Chorus]
 
F
Down in the valley with
Am
Whiskey rivers
C                               G
These are the places you will find me hidin'
F                               Am
These are the places I will always go
F                               C
These are the places I will always go
 
     F*
I am on my way 
     Am*
I am on my way
      F*                        C*
I am on my way back to where I started
 
 
[Bridge]
 
F       Am      C       G (build)
 
F       Am      C       G
Oh      -oh     -oh     -oh (straight strumming)
 
F       Am      C       G
Oh      -oh     -oh     -oh  (build) (continued in the background)
 
 
F                               Am
One more for the stars and the eyes of the walls
C                         G
I hail your face, and then I saw you standing out
 
F ............................... Am ............ (build)
 
C                         G
I saw your face in the crowd and you came out
 
F ................... Am ............ (build)
 
C                           G
You saw me crossing the valley and you came in
F                          Am
There was a sign on the door and it reads to me
C                            G
Just like the grass and the sign when you walked in
 
 
F       Am      C       G
Oh      -oh     -oh     -oh (straight strumming)
 
F       Am      C       G
Oh      -oh     -oh
 
 
      F*
I am on my way
     Am*
I am on my way
      F                C
I am on my way back to where I started
F            Am
  California, Oklahoma
     C                         G
And all of the places I ain't ever been to but
 
 
[Chorus]
 
F
  Down in the valley with
Am
   Whiskey rivers
C                               G
  These are the places you will find me hidin'
F*                            Am*
These are the places I will always go
F*                          C
These are the places I will always go
 
C
      F                                 C     C
So I wish I was a slave to an age-old trade
F                      C
Lord have mercy on my rough and rowdy ways
