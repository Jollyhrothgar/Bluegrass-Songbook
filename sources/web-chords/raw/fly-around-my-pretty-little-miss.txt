   Built to Spill - Fly Around My Pretty Little Miss
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Album : Ancient Melodies Of the Future 2002
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Tabbed by Marcus Hautz (endofallthings at gmx. de)
 
Standard Tuning. Time between chords is 1 measure, the change from
Em to G is faster though: look at the text, where the chords are placed.
You can also try to play a different Em (Em7?). Might sound better.
 
Enjoy !
 
-- Intro in C ---
 
C            Am
I know youre making
 
Dm            Em        G    C
Accidents and stars for everyone
 
          Am
You are amazing
 
Dm                Em     G         C
Half of them wont know until youre gone
 
            Am
and in this ritual you 
 
Dm               Em        G       C
take command and lose control
 
            Am
and in this situation 
 
Dm             Em        G
find and ocean sell your soul
 
Am                          C
fly around my pretty little miss
why dont you
Am                          C
fly around my pretty little miss
why dont you
Am                          C
fly around my pretty little miss
why dont you
Am                          C
fly around my pretty little miss
 
C            Am
and when its over
Dm          Em     G     C
set aside a moment to forget
           Am
its now or never
Dm                 Em          G        C
nows the chance to choose what youll regret
             Am
youre taking all your time and 
Dm               Em        G       C
leaving you with more than i want
          Am
because i know this time 
Dm         Em  G
absolutely positively 
 
C     Am     Dm     Em   G
 maybe  maybe  maybe   maybe
C     Am     Dm     Em   G
 maybe  maybe  maybe   maybe
 
Am                          C
fly around my pretty little miss
why dont you
Am                          C
fly around my pretty little miss
why dont you
Am                          C
fly around my pretty little miss
why dont you
Am                          C
fly around my pretty little miss
 
--- SOLO ---
 
Am               C
     and all the signs of your life
Am                C
     youre making all time all right
Am               C
     and all the minds of your life
Am               C
     you make it fine
 
C            Am
and when its later
Dm           Em     G       C
open up your window just in case
          Am
you are a radar, 
Dm                 Em      G    C
built to scan the deeps of outerspace
           Am
and if you recognize 
Dm              Em     G     C
subtle patterns in the sky
              Am
youll take it as a sign 
Dm           Em    G
   unless it eases your mind
 
Am                          C
fly around my pretty little miss
why dont you
Am                          C
fly around my pretty little miss
why dont you
Am                          C
fly around my pretty little miss
why dont you
Am                          C
fly around my pretty little miss
