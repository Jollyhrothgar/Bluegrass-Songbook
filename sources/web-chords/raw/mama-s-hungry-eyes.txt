[Intro]
D
 
 
[Verse 1]
  D              D7         G             D
A canvas-covered cabin in a crowded labor camp
                             A7
Stand out in this memory I revive
         D              D7           G                      D
Cause my Daddy raised a family there   with two hardworking hands
                     A7            D
And tried to feed my Mama's hungry eyes
 
 
[Verse 2]
D                         D7     G                        D
  He dreamed of something better   and my Mama's hand was strong
                                      A7
And us kids were just too young to realize
      D               D7            G                D
That another class of people put us somewhere just below
                       A7            D     C G D
One more reason for my Mama's hungry eyes
 
 
[Chorus]
N.C. D             G          D
Mama never had the luxury she wanted
                        G            D
But it wasn't 'cause my Daddy didn't try
                G                 D
She only wanted things she really needed
                       A7            D
One more reason for my Mama's hungry eyes
 
 
[Verse 3]
    D            D7            G             D
I remember Daddy praying for a better way of life
                                   A7
But I don't recall a change of any size
       D              D7               G            D
Just a little loss of courage as their age began to show
                       A7            D    C G D
And more sadness in my Mama's hungry eyes
 
 
[Chorus]
N.C. D             G          D
Mama never had the luxury she wanted
                        G                D
But it wasn't 'cause my Daddy, he didn't try
                G                 D
She only wanted things she really needed
                       A7            D
One more reason for my Mama's hungry eyes
 
 
[Outro]
    D                 A7            D    C G D
Oh, I still recall my Mama's hungry eyes
