[Intro]
 
Am F C G
 
 
[Verse]
 
Am                                     F
You're everything I thought you never were
                                        C
Ain't nothing like a thought could have been
                          G
Still, you live inside of me
 
So tell me how is that
Am                                   F
You're the only one I wish I could forget
                               C
The only one I love to not forgive
                           G
And though you break my heart
 
You're the only one
Dm
And though there are times when I hate you
       F
'Cause I can't erase
       C
The times that you hurt me
      G
And put tears on my face
         Dm
And even now while I hate you
       F
It pains me to say
      Am
I know I'll be there
     G
At the end of the day
 
 
[Chorus]
 
 Am
I don't wanna be without you babe
 F
I don't want a broken heart
  C
Don't wanna take a breath without you babe
  G
I don't wanna play that part
  Am
I know that I love you
  F
But let me just say
  C
I don't wanna love you
  G
In no kind of way, no no
  Dm
I don't want a broken heart
  F                                    Am
I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl
  G F                Am     F C  G
No, no, no broken-hearted girl
 
 
[Verse]
 
Am                                     F
Something that I feel I need to say
                                                 C
But untill now I've always been afraid
                                                G
That you would never come around
 
And still I wanna put this out
 
Am                                                     F
You say you got the most respect for me but
                                                              C
Sometimes I feel you're not deserved of me
                                       G
And still you're in my heart
 
But you're the only one
 
Dm
And yes, there are times when I hate you
            F
But I don't complain
            C
'Cause I've been afraid that
        G
You would walk away
 
Dm
Oh but now I don't hate you
          F
I'm happy to say
        Am
That I will be there
           G
At the end of the day
 
 
[Chorus]
 
 Am
I don't wanna be without you babe
 F
I don't want a broken heart
  C
Don't wanna take a breath without you babe
  G
I don't wanna play that part
  Am
I know that I love you
  F
But let me just say
  C
I don't wanna love you
  G
In no kind of way, no no
  Dm
I don't want a broken heart
  F                                    Am
I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl
  G F                     Dm
No, no, no broken-hearted girl
 
 
[Bridge]
 
Dm                                    Am
Now I met a place I thought I'd never be, oh
Dm                                        Am
I'm living in a world whereas all about you and me, yeah
F                                 C
And I won't be afraid, my broken heart as free
             F     C/E Dm  C  Bm7  E7       Am
To spread my wings and fly away, away with you
Am                F   C   G
Yeah Yeah Yeah
 
 
[Chorus]
 
 Am
I don't wanna be without you babe
 F
I don't want a broken heart
  C
Don't wanna take a breath without you babe
  G
I don't wanna play that part
  Am
I know that I love you
  F
But let me just say
  C
I don't wanna love you
  G
In no kind of way, no no
  Dm
I don't want a broken heart
  F                                    Am
I don't wanna play the broken-hearted girl
  G F                Am     F C  G
No, no, no broken-hearted girl
Am                              G      F
No broken-hearted girl No no
