[Intro]
Bbmaj7 Ebmaj7 F7
Bbmaj7 Ebmaj7 F7
 
 
[Verse 1]
    Bbmaj7         Ebmaj7
You see the ray of light
     F7             Bbmaj7 Ebmaj7 F7
Come down here with me
    Bbmaj7         Ebmaj7
And now you blow a kiss
         F7           Dm7   G7
From the palm of your hand
    Ebmaj7          A7
The rain is falling down
     Fm                G7
Just slowly through my mind
      Ebmaj7         F7
We're dancing on the clouds
                  Bbmaj7  Bb7
Don't know how to waltz
 
 
[Chorus]
     Ebmaj7        Ebm
Your lovely gentle smile
      Bbmaj7          Gm
Feels like a glass of wine
  Ebmaj7             D7
I see the dreams you hold inside
   Gm                       Bb   Bb7
So don't let your heart run away
    Ebmaj7         Ebm
Farewell to loneliness
   Bb           Gm
In every single night
            Ebmaj7
Want you to know
F7
Can't get you off my mind
 
[Interlude]
Bbmaj7 Ebmaj7 F7
Bbmaj7 Ebmaj7 F7
 
 
[Verse 2]
       Bbmaj7         Ebmaj7
Though this will be a while
    F7          Bbmaj7 Ebmaj7 F7
May you hold me tight
     Bbmaj7         Ebmaj7
I'll take the rest away
      F7             Dm7   G7
Which makes you feel blue
    Ebmaj7          A7
The moon is shining bright
   Fm                  G7
So softly through your eyes
      Ebmaj7         F7
We're dancing on the clouds
                  Bbmaj7  Bb7
Don't know how to waltz
 
 
[Chorus]
     Ebmaj7        Ebm
Your lovely gentle smile
      Bbmaj7          Gm
Feels like a glass of wine
  Ebmaj7             D7
I see the dreams you hold inside
   Gm                       Bb   Bb7
So don't let your heart run away
    Ebmaj7         Ebm
Farewell to loneliness
   Bb           Gm
In every single night
            Ebmaj7
Want you to know
F7                  Ebmaj7  A7  Fm G7
Can't get you off my mind
 
Ebmaj7 F7 Dm7 G7
 
 
[Outro]
     Ebmaj7         Ebm
Your lovely tender smile
      Bbmaj7             Gm
Keeps running through my mind
              Ebmaj7
How would you know
F7                Dm7  G7
If I could be the one?
               Ebmaj7  F7
So please come closer
      Bbmaj7         Ebmaj7
We're dancing on the clouds
      F7           Bbmaj7
Don't know how to waltz
