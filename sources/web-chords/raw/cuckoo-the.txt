[1st Verse]
Am
Oh the cuckoo she's a pretty bird
        Em             Am
And she warbles as she flies

Jack of Diamonds, Jack of Diamonds
           Em              Am
You're the meanest card I know.
Am
Well you've robbed my poor pockets
          Em          Am
Of the silver and the gold
 
[Verse 3]
Am
I'm goin up up on a mountain
               Em             Am
I' m gonna build me a whiskey still
Am
And I'll sell you one bottle
          Em        Am
For a twenty dollar-bill
 
[Verse 4]
Am
I'm going up upon a hillside
                 Em         Am
And I'm gonna stand lookin' down
Am
So I can see my little baby
         Em                    Am
Whenever she comes walkin' round
 
[Verse 5]
Am
Oh the cuckoo she's a pretty bird

And she warbles as she flies
Am
And she never holler cuckoo
            Em         Am
'Til the 4th day of July

Well, I'll eat, when I'm hungry

Then I'll live  a long time

And she never tells no lies.
