          G                         C            G
There's a cabin in the pines in the hills of Caroline
      G                                   D
And a blue eyed girl is waiting there for me
        G                             C              G
I'll be going back some day, and from her I'll never stray
        G            D            G
And the cabin in the hills of Caroline
 
 
        C                          G
Oh, the cabin in the shadow of the pines
        G                              D
And the blue eyed girl way down in Caroline
     G                                C            G
Some day she'll be my wife, and we'll live a happy life
       G            D            G
In the cabin in the hills of Caroline
 
 
    G                   C              G
I'm packing my grip for that long long trip
G                        D
Back to the hills of Caroline
          G                                  C               G
I want to see that blue eyed girl, she's the sweetest in the world
        G            D            G
And the cabin in the hills of Caroline
 
 
        C                          G
Oh, the cabin in the shadow of the pines
        G                              D
And the blue eyed girl way down in Caroline
     G                                C            G
Some day she'll be my wife, and we'll live a happy life
       G            D            G
In the cabin in the hills of Caroline
 
 
    G                               C               G
And when it's late at night and the moon is shining bright
        G                                D
And the whippoorwill is calling from the hills
          G                     C                G
Then I'll tell her of my love beneath the stars above
      G                  D             G
How I love her now and I know I always will
 
 
        C                          G
Oh, the cabin in the shadow of the pines
        G                              D
And the blue eyed girl way down in Caroline
     G                                C            G
Some day she'll be my wife, and we'll live a happy life
       G            D            G
In the cabin in the hills of Caroline
