[Intro]
E   A   E   A
 
[Verse 1]
E                           A
There's somethin' happenin' here.
        E                A
What it is ain't exactly clear.
          E                   A
There's a man with a gun over there
          E                    A
A-tellin' me I've got to beware.
 
[Chorus]
                     E
I think it's time we stop.
          D
Children, what's that sound?
A                     A7
Everybody look what's goin' down.
 
E   A   E   A
 
[Verse 2]
E                          A
There's battle lines bein' drawn.
         E                    A
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong.
E                           A
Young people speakin' their minds
          E                  A
A-gettin' so much resistance from behind.
 
[Chorus]
             E
It's time we stop.
     D
Hey, what's that sound?
A                     A7
Everybody look what's goin' down.
 
E   A   E   A
 
[Verse 3]
E                        A       G
What a field day for the heat.
  E                      A       G
A thousand people in the street
        E                    A  G
Singin' songs and a-carryin' signs
        E                    A    G
Mostly sayin' hooray for our side.
 
[Chorus]
             E
It's time we stop.
     D
Hey, what's that sound?
A                     A7
Everybody look what's goin' down.
 
E   A   E   A
 
[Verse 4]
E                A
Paranoia strikes deep.
 E                      A
Into your life it will creep.
E                             A
It starts when you're always afraid.
            E                      A
Step out of line, the men come and take you away.
 
[Chorus/Outro]
           E
You better stop.
     D
Hey, what's that sound?
A                     A7
Everybody look what's goin'...
           E
You better stop.
     D
Hey, what's that sound?
A                     A7
Everybody look what's goin'...
           E
You better stop.
     D
Now, what's that sound?
A                     A7
Everybody look what's goin'...
           E
You better stop.
          D
Children, what's that sound? (fade out)
A                     A7
Everybody look what's goin'...
