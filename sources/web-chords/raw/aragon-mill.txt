       G                       Em
At the east end of town at the foot of the hill,
          D                       C      G
there‘s a chimney so tall it says Aragon Mill.
            G                      Em
But there‘s no smoke at all comin’ out of it’s stack,
          D                       C            G
since the mill has shut down it‘s never coming back.
 
 
[Refrain]
        G                       Em
And the only tune I hear is the sound of the wind,
       D                                C     D         G
as she blows through the town weave and spin, weave and spin.
 
           G                       Em
There's no children playin‘ in the dark narrow streets,
          D                           C                  G
since the mill has shut down, it's so quiet that I can't sleep.
     G                               Em
The mill has shut down, but it's the only life I know,
         D                        C            G
tell me, what will I do, tell me, where will I go?
 
[Refrain]
G                               Em
And the only tune I hear is the sound of the wind,
       D                                C     D         G
as she blows through the town weave and spin, weave and spin.
 
        G                        Em
I'm too old to work, and I'm too young to die.
         D                       C          G
Tell me, where will I go now, my family and I?
           G                     Em
There‘s no use anymore for these cotton mills it seems,
        D                 C               G
but the sound of the loom still haunts my dreams.
 
G         D
Weave and spin...
D         G
Weave and spin...
