[Verse 1]
A                       D           A
The lonesome sound of a train going by
A                E        A
Makes me want to stop and cry
A                    D         A
I recall the day it took you a-way
A            E        A
I'm blue I'm lonesome too
 
[Chorus]
E                A
When I hear that lonesome whistle blow
B                 E            E7
I want to pack my suitcase and go
A                       D           A
The lonesome sound of a train going by
A                E        A
Makes me want to stop and cry
 
[Solos]
 
[Verse 2]
A                                D          A
In the still of the night in the pale moon-light
A            E          A
The wind, it moans and sighs
A                   D            A
These awful blues   I just can't lose
A            E        A
I'm blue I'm lonesome too
 
[Chorus]
E                A
When I hear that lonesome whistle blow
B                 E            E7
I want to pack my suitcase and go
A                       D           A
The lonesome sound of a train going by
A                E        A
Makes me want to stop and cry
 
[Outro]
A            E        A     E A
I'm blue I'm lonesome too
