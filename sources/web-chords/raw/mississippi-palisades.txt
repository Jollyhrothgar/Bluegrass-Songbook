[Intro]
| Eb | Bb | Eb | F |
 
 
[Verse 1]
 Bb
Where you can hear a country song from far
                                     F
and someone plays the honky-tonk guitar
                                        Bb
Where all the lights will go out one by one
                    C
the people join the song
         C7             F
and the wind takes it away
 
 
[Verse 2]
           Bb
Where the Mississippi rolls down to the sea
                                           F
and lovers found the place they'd like to be
                                   Bb
how many times before the song was ending
                F
love and understanding
             Bb
everywhere around
 
 
[Chorus]
 Bb                  F
Miii....iiii ... ssissippi,
                Bb
I'll remember you, whenever I should go away
 F
I'll be longing for the day
     C                         F    Eb Dm C
that I will be in Greenville again  ...
 
 Bb                  F
Miii....iiii ... ssissippi,
                 Bb
you'll be on my mind
Eb                          Bb
... every time I hear this song
                   F
Mississippi roll along
                  Bb
until the end of time
 
 
[Interlude]
| Eb | Bb | Eb | F |
 
 
[Verse 2]
         Bb
Now the country song for ever lost its soul
                                         F
when the guitar player turned to rock & roll
                                      Bb
and every time when summer nights are falling
                  F                       Bb
I will always be calling dreams of yesterday
 
 
[Chorus]
 Bb                  F
Miii....iiii ... ssissippi,
                Bb
I'll remember you, whenever I should go away
 F
I'll be longing for the day
     C                         F    Eb Dm C
that I will be in Greenville again  ...
 
 Bb                  F
Miii....iiii ... ssissippi,
                 Bb
you'll be on my mind
Eb                          Bb
... every time I hear this song
                   F
Mississippi roll along
                  Bb
until the end of time
