[Intro]
 
E   A   E   B7  E
 
 
[Verse 1]
       E
I went down to the river to watch the fish swim by;
      A                                        E N.C.     E
But I got to the river so lonesome I wanted to die..., oh Lord!
           B7                                             E
And then I jumped in the river, but the doggone river was dry.
 
 
[Refrain]
      E    A         E       B7       E
She's long gone, and now I'm lonesome blue.
 
 
[Bridge 1]
  E
I had me a woman who couldn't be true.
 
She made me for my money and she made me blue.
  A
A man needs a woman that he can lean on,
       E                    B7       E
But my leanin' post is done left and gone.
 
 
[Refrain]
      E    A         E       B7       E
She's long gone, and now I'm lonesome blue.
 
 
[Interlude]
 
E   A   E   B7  E
 
 
[Verse 2]
          E
I'm gonna find me a river, one that's cold as ice.
           A                                          E N.C.    E
And when I find me that river, Lord I'm gonna pay the price, oh Lord!
          B7                                                  E
I'm goin' down in it three times, but Lord I'm only comin' up twice.
 
 
[Refrain]
      E    A         E       B7       E
She's long gone, and now I'm lonesome blue.
 
 
[Bridge 2]
    E
She told me on Sunday she was checkin' me out;
 
Along about Monday she was nowhere about.
    A
And here it is Tuesday, ain't had no news.
  E                        B7     E
I got them gone but not forgotten blues.
 
 
[Refrain]
      E    A         E       B7       E
She's long gone, and now I'm lonesome blue.
