By: Larry Sparks
Genre: Bluegrass
 
 
[Intro]
 
B   E
 
[Verse 1]
 
         E
Have you ever been to Richmond in November
         G#                           A
When the cold Virginia rain is coming down
                                     E
Friends I'm here to tell you it's no pleasure
          F#                               B
If you're all alone and a stranger to this town
 
[Verse 2]
 
      E
Don't take me wrong I do like East Virginia
    G#                          A
And Richmond's full of hospitality
                               E
Except for one Virginia girl I know of
                    B                E
That made a perfect love wreck out of me
 
[Chorus]
 
A    B             E
Blue blue Virginia blues
      A                    E            B
There ain’t no blue like blue Virginia blues
A                                 B
There ain’t no other girls in the whole wide world
     E                     A
Will break your heart like Virginia girls
        E                  A       B      E
There's ain’t no blue like blue Virginia blues
 
[Verse 3]
 
    E
She called me up in St Paul Minnesota
       G#                              A
Said I need you here in Richmond right away
                                      E
Take the bus and I'll meet you at the station
F#                                     B
Bring some clothes I might want you to stay
 
[Verse 4]
 
   E
My bus pulled in the station late this evening
      G#                                 A
There ain’t a soul around this place but me
                                        E
She must have changed her mind or she's forgotten
                          B         E
And her name ain’t in the phone directory
 
[Chorus]
 
A    B             E
Blue blue Virginia blues
      A                    E            B
There ain’t no blue like blue Virginia blues
A                                 B
There ain’t no other girls in the whole wide world
     E                     A
Will break your heart like Virginia girls
        E                  A       B      E
There's ain’t no blue like blue Virginia blues
 
[Verse 5]
 
  E
I wish I had the money for a taxi
      G#                            A
And a warm and cozy place to lay me down
                                 E
Instead of standing all alone in Richmond
                        B             E
While the cold Virginia rain is coming down
 
[Chorus]
 
A    B             E
Blue blue Virginia blues
      A                    E            B
There ain’t no blue like blue Virginia blues
A                                 B
There ain’t no other girls in the whole wide world
     E                     A
Will break your heart like Virginia girls
        E                  A       B      E
There's ain’t no blue like blue Virginia blues
 
A          E                  A        B      E
Oh there's ain’t no blue like blue Virginia blues
 
[The End]
