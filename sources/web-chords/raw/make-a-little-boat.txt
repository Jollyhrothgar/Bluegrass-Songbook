* First line is acapella on record.
 
[Verse]
       E             B
It's a hard living, tail kicking
E                   A
Trip that we're all on, but I'm betting
E                                    B
We can find a little sunshine in the night
       E              B
It's a back breaking, soul taking
E                A                   E
Road we walk, so what are we waiting for
                        B
Baby let's turn off the lights
       Cdim7              C#m                    Am
'Cause girl, there's just not enough love in the world
 
[Chorus]
             E
So we should make a little
E
Generate a little
E
Maybe even make the world a better place a little
         A
We could turtle dove, Dixie land delight
            E                            Ab A Bb
You know it can't be wrong when it feels so right
   B
It all comes down to you and me, girl
             A
There's just not enough love in the world
             E
So we should make a little
     B                    E
Then make a little more tonight
 
[Verse]
       E               B
It's a clock punching, cash crunching
E                A
 And it all adds up to nothing
E                        B
If you're in this thing alone
   E                    B
So don't tease me, it's so easy
E            A           E                              B
To just turn off the TV, and make some headlines of our own
     Cdim7              C#m                    Am6
Yeah girl, there's just not enough love in the world
 
[Chorus]
             E
So we should make a little
E
Conjugate a little
E
Maybe even make the world a better place a little
         A
We could turtle dove, Dixie land delight
            E                            Ab A Bb
You know it can't be wrong when it feels so right
   B
It all comes down to you and me, girl
             A
There's just not enough love in the world
             E
So we should make a little
     B                    E
Then make a little more tonight
 
[Solo]
That's right walk up E string
E F F# G G#
A E
A E
A E
 
[Bridge]
B
Yeah
     Cdim7              C#m                     Am6
Yeah girl, there's just not enough love in the world
 
[Chorus]
             E
So we should make a little
E
Consummate a little
E
Maybe even make the world a better place a little
         A
We could turtle dove, Dixie land delight
            E                            Ab A Bb
You know it can't be wrong when it feels so right
   B
It all comes down to you and me, girl
There's just not enough love in the world
             E
So we should make a little
     B
Then make a little more
          E
We should make a little
     A
Then make a little more
          E
We should make a little
     B                    E
Then make a little more tonight
 
[Outro]
A    E              A          E
Wooh Ooh Talk about loving all night
A    E   B   E7
Yeah Yeah
