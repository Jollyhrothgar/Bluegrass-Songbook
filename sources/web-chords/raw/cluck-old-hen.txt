[Verse 1]
Am                 G        Am
My old hen she’s a good old hen
Am                    E        Am
She lays eggs for the railroad men
Am            G         Am
Sometimes one sometimes two
Am                       E     G    Am
Sometimes enough for the whole damn crew
 
[Chorus]
Am        G             Am
Cluck old hen cluck and sing
Am                          E    G    Am
You ain’t laid an egg since late last spring
Am        G             Am
Cluck old hen cluck and squall
Am                      E    G    Am
Ain’t laid an egg since late last fall
 
[Verse 2]
Am             G        Am
My old hen’s a good old hen
Am                    E        Am
She lays eggs for the railroad men
Am        G                   Am
Sometimes eight and sometimes ten
Am                   E     G   Am
That’s enough for the railroad men
 
[Chorus]
Am        G                    Am
Cluck old hen cluck when I tell you
Am                   E     G    Am
Cluck old hen or I’m gonna sell you
Am                    G             Am
Last time she cackled cackled in the lot
Am                     E      G     Am
Next time she cackles cackle in the pot
