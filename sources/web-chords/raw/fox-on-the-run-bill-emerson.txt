[Chorus]
G                     D           Am          C
She walks through the corn leadin down to the river
    Am              D           C           G
Her hair shone like gold in the hot morning sun
G                 D          Am             C
She took all the love that a poor boy could give her
    Am         D          C          G
And left me to die like a fox on the run
       C                                  G
Like a fox, Like a fox, Like a fox on the run
 
[Verse 1]
    C         G         D              G
Now everybody knows the reason for my fall
     C             G           A7       D
A woman tempted me down in paradise hall
     C             G           D             G
This woman tempted me and she took me for a ride
     C             G            D               G
But, like a lonely fox, boys, I need a place to hide
 
[Chorus]
G                     D           Am          C
She walks through the corn leadin down to the river
    Am              D           C           G
Her hair shone like gold in the hot morning sun
G                 D          Am             C
She took all the love that a poor boy could give her
    Am         D          C          G
And left me to die like a fox on the run
        C                                 G
Like a fox, Like a fox, Like a fox on the run
 
[Verse 2]
      C                G              D           G
We’ll drink a glass of wine, boys, to fortify our souls
      C               G            A7                 D
We’ll talk about the world and the friends we used to know
  C                G             D           G
I see a string of girls who have put me on before
    C              G             D                G
The game is nearly over and the hounds are at the door
 
[Chorus]
G                     D           Am          C
She walks through the corn leadin down to the river
    Am              D           C           G
Her hair shone like gold in the hot morning sun
G                 D          Am             C
She took all the love that a poor boy could give her
    Am         D          C          G
And left me to die like a fox on the run
        C                                 G
Like a fox, Like a fox, Like a fox on the run
