[Intro]
A
 
 
[Verse 1]
A
Dear Nellie since I left the city
     D                     A
I’ve found I’ve changed my mind
A
I hope you wont think me untruthful
             E       A
Or do me the least unkind
 
 
[Verse 2]
A
I think we’re both mistaken
  D                      A
I know you’ll never suit me
A
I owe my heart to another
               E             A
Of course kind friends will agree
 
 
[Verse 3]
A
Please send me my ring and pictures
  D                 A
Also my letters and books
A
My clothes with many kind wishes
             E             A
Respectfully yours Charlie Brooks
 
 
[Verse 4]
A
I heard all about it dear Charlie
  D                      A
I knew it would end this way
A
I hope you will always live happy
                        E         A
With your loving little wife Miss Gray
 
 
[Outro]
A
Here is your ring dear Charlie
      D                A
Don’t give it to her I pray
A
Unless you tell her twas once mine
              E      A
I wore it one year today
