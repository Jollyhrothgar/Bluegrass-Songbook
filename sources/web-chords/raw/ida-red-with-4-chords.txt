[Verse]
  D
Lights in the parlor, fire's in the grate
                          A7           D
Clock on the mantle says it's getting late
 
Curtains on the window, snowy white
                             A7     D
The parlor's pleasant on a Sunday night
 
[Chorus]
 D
Ida Red, Ida Red,
                    A7   D
Im plumb fool about Ida Red
 
[Verse 2]
  D
Lamp on the table, picture on the wall,
                            A7        D
There's a pretty sofa and that's not all
 
If I'm not mistaken and I'm sure I'm right
                               A7     D
There's somebody else in the parlor tonite
 
[Chorus]
 D
Ida Red, Ida Red,
                    A7   D
Im plumb fool about Ida Red
 
[Verse 3]
   D
Chicken in the bread pan, pecking out dough
                            A7      D
Granny will your dog bite? No child no
 
Hurry up boys and don't fool around
                        A7      D
Grab your partner and truck on down
 
[Chorus]
 D
Ida Red, Ida Red,
                    A7   D
Im plumb fool about Ida Red
 
[Verse 4]
  D
Lights a burnin' dim, fire's a gettin low
                    A7      D
Somebody says it's time to go
 
I hear a whisper, gently and light
                           A7    D
Dont forget to come next Sunday night
 
[Chorus]
 D
Ida Red, Ida Red,
                    A7   D
Im plumb fool about Ida Red
 
[Verse 5]
 D
My old misses swore to me
                     A7     D
When she died she's set me free
 
She lived so long her head got bald
                          A7     D
She took a notion not to die at all
 
[Chorus]
 D
Ida Red, Ida Red,
                    A7   D
Im plumb fool about Ida Red
