| Em | % | B7 | Em |
 
[Chorus]
Em
Man gave names to all the animals
         B7                Em
In the beginning, in the beginning
Em
Man gave names to all the animals
         B7                  Em
In the beginning, long time ago
 
[Verse 1]
Em                              B7
 He saw an animal that liked to growl
B7                              Em
 Big furry paws and he liked to howl
Em                              A
 Great big furry back and furry hair
B               B7        Em
"Ah, think I'll call it a bear"
 
[Chorus]
Em
Man gave names to all the animals
         B7                Em
In the beginning, in the beginning
Em
Man gave names to all the animals
         B7                  Em
In the beginning, long time ago
 
[Verse 2]
Em                        B7
 He saw an animal up on a hill
B7                                     Em
Chewing up so much grass until she was filled
Em                                        A
He saw milk coming out but he didn't know how
B               B7        Em
"Ah, think I'll call it a cow"
 
[Chorus]
Em
Man gave names to all the animals
         B7                Em
In the beginning, in the beginning
Em
Man gave names to all the animals
         B7                  Em
In the beginning, long time ago
 
[Verse 3]
Em                              B7
 He saw an animal that liked to snort
B7                                     Em
Horns on his head and they weren't too short
   Em                                                A
It looked like there wasn't nothing that he couldn't pull
B                 B7        Em
"Ah, I think I'll call it a bull"
 
[Chorus]
Em
Man gave names to all the animals
         B7                Em
In the beginning, in the beginning
Em
Man gave names to all the animals
         B7                  Em
In the beginning, long time ago
 
[Verse 4]
Em                                B7
 He saw an animal leaving a muddy trail
B7                          Em
Real dirty face and a curly tail
Em                                     A
 He wasn't too small and he wasn't too big
B               B7        Em
"Ah, think I'll call it a pig"
 
[Chorus]
Em
Man gave names to all the animals
         B7                Em7
In the beginning, in the beginning
Em
Man gave names to all the animals
         B7                  Em
In the beginning, long time ago
 
[Verse 5]
Em                       B7
 Next animal that he did meet
B7                              Em
Had wool on his back and hooves on his feet
Em                              A
Eating grass on a mountainside so steep
B               B7        Em
"Ah, think I'll call it a sheep"
 
[Chorus]
Em
Man gave names to all the animals
         B7                Em
In the beginning, in the beginning
Em
Man gave names to all the animals
         B7                  Em
In the beginning, long time ago
 
[Coda]
Em                             B7
 He saw an animal as smooth as glass
B7                              Em
 Slithering his way through the grass
Em                                 A          B
Saw him disappear by a tree near a lake ...
