Jesse James
 
[Verse 1]
  G                              C             G
When Jesse James was a lad he’d killed many a man,
                         D7
He robbed the Glendale train,
 G                               C           G
And the people they did say for many miles away
G                 D7                G
It was robbed by Frank and Jesse James.
 
 
[Chorus]
    C                       G
Poor Jesse had a wife who mourned for his life,
                                      D7
Three children - they were brave and true
    G                            C                G
But that dirty little coward who shot Mister Howard
   G               D7       G
Has laid poor Jesse in his grave
 
 
[Verse 2]
  G                              C             G
It was on a Saturday night if I remember it right
                                 D7
When they robbed that Glendale train.
       G                           C                   G
It was one of the Younger boys who gathered in the spoils,
   G                D7           G
And he carried Jesse's monies away.
 
 
[Chorus]
    C                       G
Poor Jesse had a wife who mourned for his life
                                      D7
Three children - they were brave and true
    G                            C                G
But that dirty little coward who shot Mister Howard
   G               D7       G
Has laid poor Jesse in his grave
 
 
[Verse 3]
  G                              C             G
He was standing on a chair just a dustin pictures there
                         D7
He thought he heard a noise
    G                                 C                      G
When he turned his head around, then a bullet smacked him down
 G               D7              G
And it laid poor Jesse on the floor
 
 
[Chorus]
    C                       G
Poor Jesse had a wife who mourned for his life
                                      D7
Three children - they were brave and true
    G                            C                G
But that dirty little coward who shot Mister Howard
   G               D7       G
Has laid poor Jesse in his grave
 
 
[Verse 4]
  G                              C             G
Jesse robbed from the rich and he gave to the poor
                              D7
He never did an un-friendly thing
        G                             C                  G
And when his best friend died he was right there by her side
 G               D7              G
And he lifted off her golden wedding ring
 
 
[Chorus]
    C                       G
Poor Jesse had a wife who mourned for his life
                                      D7
Three children - they were brave and true
    G                            C                G
But that dirty little coward who shot Mister Howard
   G               D7       G
Has laid poor Jesse in his grave
