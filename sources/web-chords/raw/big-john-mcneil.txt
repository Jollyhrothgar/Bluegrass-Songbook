[Intro]
A
 
[Verse 1]
A                                          D                  A
The old man stares down at his wrinkled hands that pulls the bow
D                  A             B7              E
Wishes he could still remember tunes he use to know
D                                             A                  D
The Jigs and Reels these lines reveal the errors that make the man
D                                 E                  A
Sharps and Flats at Ninety Years are written on his hands
 
[Verse 2]
A                                  D                  A
He remembersd all the dances he played in country halls
D                  A             B7              E
The time He got a dollar and played from dusk til dawn
D                                  A                  D
He remebers smiling faces as the dancers crossed the floor
 D                                 E                  A
Now they call for one more dance but he could play no more
 
[Chorus]
E                                     A
He'd play the Road to Boston and the Pigeon on the Gate
E                        D               E
The Irish Washer Woman and if it wasn't late
D                                A                      D
He'd play the Mason's Apron and the Llovely Princess Reel,
D                                  E             A
But best of all the one they call "Big John McNeil" (Full Stop)
 
[Instrumental]
A E
 
[Verse 3]
A                            D                  A
Every tune he ever played are on thee hands you see
D                  A             B7              E
For everyone remebered he's forgotten two or three
D                                             A                  D
His life haas  been these Jiggs and Reels Five times he's stacked the hand
D                                 E                  A
But his hands are getting tired now and his fingers worn in sands
 
[Chorus]
 E                                     A
He'd play the Road to Boston and the Pigeon on the Gate
E                        D               E
The Irish Washer Woman and if it wasn't late
D                                A                      D
He'd play the Mason's Apron and the Llovely Princess Reel,
D                                  E             A
But best of all the one they call "Big John McNeil"
 
[Instrumental]
A E
 
[Verse 4]
D
Someday they'll lay him in a box with a fiddle in his hand
E                                                      A
He'll be playing somewhere where the people love to dance (Full Stop)
 
[Instrumental]
A E
