Operator, number please, it's been so many years
     D     A7     D      A7    Bm      A         G     G
Will she remember my old voice while I fight the tears?
  D      B7         Em      A7      D       B7      Em    A7

And I am calling long distance, don't worry about the cost
       D         B7     Em       A7        D       B7       Em   A7
'Cause it's been fourty years or more now, Martha, please recall
    D       B7      Em     A7          Bm    A       G    G
And meet me out for coffee where we'll talk about it all, and
 
[Chorus]
D          D       G     G    D  D       G
Those were days of roses,  of poetry and prose
    G       Bm    Bm      G        G       Em  A   D  G
And Martha, all I had was you, and all you had was me
D         D    G       G    D       D       G
There was no tomorrows,  we packed away our sorrows
G      Bm         Bm    G  A  D   G  D
And we saved them for a rainy day
 
D  A7  D  A7  Bm  A  G  G

How's your husband, and how's your kids? You know that I got married too
D       B7       Em        A7     D        B7     Em   A7
  Lucky that you found someone to make you feel secure
       D       B7     Em        A7       Bm     A     G     G
'Cause we were all so young and foolish, now we are mature, and
 
[Chorus]
D          D       G     G    D  D       G
Those were days of roses,  of poetry and prose
    G       Bm    Bm      G        G       Em  A   D  G
And Martha, all I had was you, and all you had was me
D         D    G       G    D       D       G
There was no tomorrows,  we packed away our sorrows
G      Bm         Bm    G  A  D   G
And we saved them for a rainy day

[Verse 3]
    D     A7     D    A7         Bm         A       G  G
And I was always so impulsive, I guess that I still am
D              A7     D        A7       Bm    A        G   G
  And all that really mattered then was that I-- was a man
  D          B7  Em      A7         D     B7       Em  A7
I guess that our being together was never meant to be
D      B7 Em     A7   Bm        A         G    G
Martha,   Martha,   I love you, can't you see? And
 
[Chorus]
D          D       G     G    D  D       G
Those were days of roses,  of poetry and prose
    G       Bm    Bm      G        G       Em  A   D  G
And Martha, all I had was you, and all you had was me
D         D    G       G    D       D       G
There was no tomorrows,  we packed away our sorrows
G      Bm         Bm    G  A  D   G
And we saved them for a rainy day
 
D  A7  D  A7  Bm  A  G  G
 
[Outro]
    D   A7     D     A7        Bm        A        G
And I remember quiet evenings, trembling close to you
