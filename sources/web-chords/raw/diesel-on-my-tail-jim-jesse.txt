[Intro]
D D D D
 
[Verse 1]
D
I just pulled onto the highway in my little foreign car.
D
Well, it's rainin' an' the road is really bad.
D
I never saw that big ol' diesel but I heard him hit the air.
                          A                   D
I've got a feelin' that I might have made him mad.
 
 
[Verse 2]
D
He closed the gap between us, pushed the pedal on the floor.
D
He's makin' ninety in that big ol' diesel truck.
D
I can hear the names he's callin' me above the engine's roar,
                                A         D
An' the words won't be found in Webster's book.
 
 
[Chorus]
G
There's a diesel on my tail a-makin' ninety miles an hour.
   D                                 A
My reflection in my mirror is mighty pale.
           D                        G                D
I can hear St. Peter callin'; I can almost smell the flowers.
                                            A            D    D A D
Can this compact take the impact? There's a diesel on my tail.
 
 
[Verse 3]
D
Well, I'm huffin' an' a-puffin' as I try to make the grade
                      A              D
An' I wish I had some pedals on this car,
 
An' I'm slippin' an' a-slidin' an' afraid to touch the brake
                         A               D
For this doodlebug could never stand the jar.
 
 
[Chorus]
G
There's a diesel on my tail a-makin' ninety miles an hour.
   D                                 A
My reflection in my mirror is mighty pale.
           D                        G                D
I can hear St. Peter callin'; I can almost smell the flowers.
                                            A            D    D A D
Can this compact take the impact? There's a diesel on my tail.

[Verse 4]
D
Well, I'm slippin' an' a-slidin' tryin' to hold it on the road,
                      A               D
An' I tell you I just got to win this race.
D
While I'm tremblin' an' a-shakin' he's a-pourin' on the coal,
                                A       D
So close that I could steal his license plate.
 
 
[Chorus]
G
There's a diesel on my tail a-makin' ninety miles an hour.
   D                                 A
My reflection in my mirror is mighty pale.
           D                        G                D
I can hear St. Peter callin'; I can almost smell the flowers.
                                            A            D
Can this compact take the impact? There's a diesel on my tail.
                                            A            D    D
Can this compact take the impact? There's a diesel on my tail.
