Am D G
 
     G
When I was at home, I was merry and frisky.
   Am                                 D
My dad kept a pig, but my mother sold whiskey.
   G
My uncle was rich, but ne er could be easy,
     Am      D         G
till I was enlisted by Corporal Casey.
     G
Och, rub-a-dub, row-de-dow, Corporal Casey,
   Am                                     D
my dear little Shelah I thought would run crazy
     G
When I trudged away with tough Corporal Casey,
     Am        D           G
Och, rub-a-dub row-de-row, Shelah my love. 
 
  G
I marched from Kilkenny, but as I was thinking,
   D
on Shelah, my heart in my bosom was sinking.
    C          G              Am         G
But soon I was forced to look fresh as a daisy,
    Am        D             G
for fear of a drubbin  from Corporal Casey.
     G
Och, rub-a-dub, row-de-dow, Corporal Casey,
    D
the devil go with him, I ne er could be lazy
   C         G              Am       G
He struck my shirts so, old Corporal Casey,
     Am        D           G
och, rub-a-dub row-de-row, Shelah my dear. 
 
   G
We went into battle, I took the blows fairly,
     Am                                    D
that fell on my pate, but they bothered me rarely.
    G
And who should the first be that dropped? Why, and please you,
          Am           D      G
it was my good friend, honest Corporal Casey.
     G
Och, rub-a-dub, row-de-dow, Corporal Casey,
       Am                               D
thinks I,  You are quiet and I shall be easy.
   G
So eight years I fought without Corporal Casey,
     Am        D           G
Och, rub-a-dub row-de-row, Shelah my gal. 
 
  G
I marched from Kilkenny, but as I was thinking,
   D
on Shelah, my heart in my bosom was sinking.
    C          G              Am         G
But soon I was forced to look fresh as a daisy,
    Am        D             G
for fear of a drubbin  from Corporal Casey.
     G
Och, rub-a-dub, row-de-dow, Corporal Casey,
    D
the devil go with him, I ne er could be lazy
   C         G              Am       G
He struck my shirts so, old Corporal Casey,
     Am        D           G
och, rub-a-dub row-de-row, Shelah my dear.
