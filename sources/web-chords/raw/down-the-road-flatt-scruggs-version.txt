[Verse 1]
 
G                                Em
Now down the road just a mile or two
G                         D7     G
Lives a little girl named Pearly Blue
                              Em
About so high and her hair is brown
    G                    D7      G
The prettiest thing boys in this town
 
 
[Verse 2]
                        Em
Now anytime you want to know
G               D7       G
Where I'm going down the road
                   Em
Get my girl on the line
       G                  D7      G
You'll find me there most any old time
 
                         Em
Now every day and Sunday too
  G            D7     G
I go to see my Pearly Blue
                             Em
Before you hear that rooster crow
       G             D7       G
You'll see me headed down the road
 
                               Em
Now old man Flatt he owned the farm
     G           D7     G
From the hog lot to the barn
                     Em
From the barn to the rail
        G             D7           G
He made his living by carrying the mail
 
                         Em
Now every time I get the blues
  G              D7           G
I walk the soles right off my shoes
                            Em
I don't know why I love her so
     G                 D7       G
That gal of mine lives down the road
