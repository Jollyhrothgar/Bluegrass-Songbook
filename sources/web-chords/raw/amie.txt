[Verse]
 
A              G         D   A         G   D
I can see why you think you belong to me.
A                 G         D       A                           D
I never tried to make you think or let you see one thing for yourself.
                C                              D
But now you’re off with someone else and I’m alone.
            C                                   E
You see I thought that I could keep you for my own.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
A      G             D     A              G               D
Amie, what you wanna do?  I think that I could stay with you,
       Bm                      E
for a while maybe longer if I do…
 
 
[Verse]
 
A                    G       D           A        G   D
Don’t you think the time is right for us to find.
A           G    D                         A                             D
All the things we thought weren’t proper could be right in time and can you see,
D         C                            D
Which way we should turn together or alone?
        C                                 E
I can never see what’s right or what is wrong…
(yeah, you take too long to see)
 
 
[Chorus]
 
A      G             D     A              G               D
Amie, what you wanna do?  I think that I could stay with you,
       Bm                      E
for a while maybe longer if I do…
 
 
(Break/solo-good luck)
 
 
[Chorus]
 
A      G             D     A              G               D
Amie, what you wanna do?  I think that I could stay with you,
       Bm                      E
for a while maybe longer if I do…
 
 
[Verse]
 
A                 G        D               A        G    D
Now it’s come to what you want, you’ve had yer way.
A                            G       D        A                         D
And all the things you’re fight’n for just faded into gray and can you see,
        C                                D
that I don’t know if it’s you or if it’s me?
         C                                E
If it’s one of us, I’m sure we both will see…
(won’t you look at me and tell me?)
 
 
[Chorus] x2
 
A      G             D     A              G               D
Amie, what you wanna do?  I think that I could stay with you,
       Bm                      E
for a while maybe longer if I do…
 
 
[Outro]
 
E         A (finger picking)  G          D    A                     G      D
I keep, fallin’ in and out of love with you.  Fallin’ in and out of love with you.
A                          G     D
Don’t know what I’m gonna do…
      A                       D              Fmaj7     E7    Aadd9
I keep, fallin’ in and out of l-o-v-e, with y---o----u…
