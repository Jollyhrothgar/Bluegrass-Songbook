[Verse 1]
C
The days are long and the nights are lonely
          F            C
Since you left me all alone
        F            C
I worry so my little darling
        F        G7          C
I worry so since you've been gone
 
 
[Chorus]
Sweetheart of mine can't you hear me calling
          F                C
A million times I love you best
             F                C
I mistreated you Lord and I'm sorry
             F     G7   C
Come back to me is my request
 
 
[Verse 2]
I'll never forget the night we parted
         F                  C
A big mistake had caused it all
               F                  C
If you'll come back sunshine will follow
        F    G7              C
If you stay away it'll be my fall
 
 
[Chorus]
Sweetheart of mine can't you hear me calling
          F                C
A million times I love you best
             F                C
I mistreated you Lord and I'm sorry
             F     G7   C
Come back to me is my request
 
 
[Verse 3]
The days are dark my little darling
         F               C
Oh how I need your sweet embrace
            F              C
When I woke up the sun was shining
       F           G7       C
When I looked up I saw your face
 
 
[Chorus]
Sweetheart of mine can't you hear me calling
          F                C
A million times I love you best
             F                C
I mistreated you Lord and I'm sorry
             F     G7   C
Come back to me is my request
