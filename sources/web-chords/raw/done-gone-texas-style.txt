[Intro]
 
Am  F  Am  F
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
Am                                   F
Midnight you come and pick me up, no headlights 
Am                                          F
Long drive, could end in burnin' flames, or paradise
     Am
Fade in to view, oh, it's been a while since I have even 
F
Heard from you, heard from you
 
Dm*                                         Em*
 And I should just tell you to leave cause I
                                 F*
Know exactly where It leads but I
                                 F
Watch us go round and round each time
 
 
[Chorus]
 
             C
You got that James Dean day dream look in your eye
               F
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
               C
And when we go crashing down we come back every time
                  F
Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
 
            C
You got the long hair slicked back, white t-shirt
               F
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
               Am
And when we go crashing down we come back every time
                  F
Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
Am                                      F
So it goes, he can't keep his wild eyes on the road
Am                                        F
Takes me home, lights are off he's taking off his coat
       Am
I say "I heard (oh) that you've been out and about 
          F
With some other girl" (some other girl)
 
Dm*                                 Em*
You say what you heard is true but I 
                                   F*
Can't stop thinking about you and I
                                F
I say I've been there too a few times
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                   C
Cause you got that James Dean day dream look in your eye
               F
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
               C
And when we go crashing down we come back every time
                  F
Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
 
            C
You got the long hair slicked back, white t-shirt
               F
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
               Am
And when we go crashing down we come back every time
                  F
Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
 
 
[Bridge]
 
        C
Take me home
             F
Just take me home, yeah
             C           F
Just take me home, ohohohoh   
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                   C
Cause you got that James Dean day dream look in your eye
               F
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
               Am
And when we go crashing down we come back every time
                  F                                      C*
Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
