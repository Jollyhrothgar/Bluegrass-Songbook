[Intro]
 
G C G C G D C G
 
 
[Verse]
 
                      C                D
Lookin back on the mem'ry of the    dance we shared
              G            D
'neath the stars above
          G                  C                         D
For a  moment all the     world was right how could I have known
              Em                     D
that you'd  ever say good         bye
 
 
[Chorus]
 
    C                      D                         Bm
And now, I'm glad I didn't know the way it all would end
                     C    D
the way it all would go
    C                         D                               Bm
Our lives, are better left to chance. I could have missed the pain
                    C    D   G
but I'd have had to miss the dance
 
 
[Interlude]
 
G C G C G D C G
 
 
[Verse]
 
                      C                D
Holding you I held everything for a moment
              G            D
wasn't     I the king?
          G                  C                         D
If I'd only known how the king would fall. Hey      who's to say
               Em                     D
You know, I might have changed it all
 
 
[Chorus]
 
    C                      D                         Bm
And now, I'm glad I didn't know the way it all would end
                     C    D
the way it all would go
    C                         D                               Bm
Our lives, are better left to chance. I could have missed the pain
                    C    D   G
but I'd have had to miss the dance
 
 
            C                         D
    Yes my life, it's better left to chance
                                  Bm
     I could have have missed the pain,
                         C    D   G
     but I'd have had to miss the dance
