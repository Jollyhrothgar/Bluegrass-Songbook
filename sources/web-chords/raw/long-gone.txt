A
Long gone is how I'm leaving
     D                A
Long gone, why do you cry
 
This is what you wanted baby
       E          A
So I'm gone, long gone
 
A
I have tried to make you happy
          D                 A
Still you say I've done you wrong
 
Oh I'm giving up my darling
       E          A
So I'm gone, long gone
 
A
Long gone is how I'm leaving
     D                A
Long gone, why do you cry
 
This is what you wanted baby
       E          A
So I'm gone, long gone
 
A
Please don't try to overtake me
       D                A
What I ride will be too fast
 
This is it, we're through forever
    E                 A
I'm gone, I'm free at last
 
A
Long gone is how I'm leaving
     D                A
Long gone, why do you cry
 
This is what you wanted baby
       E          A
So I'm gone, long gone
 
A
Please don't shed no tears at parting
         D              A
For your tears will not atone
 
After all the pain you cause me
    E          A
I'm gone, long gone
 
A
Long gone is how I'm leaving
     D                A
Long gone, why do you cry
 
This is what you wanted baby
       E          A
So I'm gone, long gone
 
A
This is what you wanted baby
       E          A
So I'm gone, long gone
