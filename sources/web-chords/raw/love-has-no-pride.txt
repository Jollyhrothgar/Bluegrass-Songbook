Love Has No Pride  Bonnie Raitt
  Capo 2
 
[Verse 1]
G            Bm     Em       A7
I've had bad dreams too many times
C                  D     C    G    D  G
To think that they don't mean much anymore
G               Bm       Em          A7
Fine times have gone and left my sad home
C                D          C    G   D  G
Friends who once cared just walk out my door
 
[Chorus]
Em          Bm           C             G
Love has no pride when I call out your name
Em          Bm                 C              G
Love has no pride when there's no one left to blame
C           D        C   G   D G    C  G  D  G
I'd give anything to see you again
 
[Verse 2]
G          Bm   Em       A7
I've been alone too many nights
   C          D         C    G    D G
To think that you could come back again
G                  Bm           Em        A7
And I've heard you talk, "she's crazy to stay"
C                      D           C    G    D   G
But this love hurts me so, I don't care what you say
 
[Chorus]
Em          Bm           C             G
Love has no pride when I call out your name
Em          Bm                 C              G
Love has no pride when there's no one left to blame
C           D        C   G   D G    C  G  D  G
I'd give anything to see you again
 
[Verse 3]
C          D                        G       Em
If I could buy your love, I'd truly try, my friend
A              A7       C                  D
And if I could pray, my prayer would never end
Am                    D         G               Em
But if you want me to beg, I'll fall down on my knees
Am                D                 Bm7                 Em
Asking for you to come back, I'd be pleading for you to come back
Am                   D          C G D G
Begging for you to come back to me
 
[Outro]
Em          Bm           C             G
Love has no pride when I call out your name
Em          Bm                 C                    G
Love has no pride when there's no one but myself to blame
C           D        C   G   D G
I'd give anything to see you again
     C           D        C   G   D G
Yes, I'd give anything to see you again
