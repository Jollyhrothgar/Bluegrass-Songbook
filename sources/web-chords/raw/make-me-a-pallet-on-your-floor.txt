Capo on the 1st fret.
 
G                             D
Make me down a pallet on your floor
G                             D
Make me down a pallet on your floor
D        A      Em                 G
Make me down a pallet soft and low
D                     A             D
When I’m broke an’ I got nowhere to go
 
G                                              D
Been hangin’ around with the good time friends of mine
G                                            D
Hangin’ around with the good time friends of mine
D        A       Em                 G
Oh, they treat me very nice and kind
D                    A             D
When I’ve got a dollar and a dime
 
G                            D
Weary blues are everywhere I see
G                            D
Weary blues are everywhere I see
D     A      Em                  G
Weary blues, honey, everywhere I see
D                A             D
No one ever had the blues like me
 
G                                         D
Way I’m sleepin’, my back and shoulders tired
G                                         D
Way I’m sleepin’, my back and shoulders tired
D        A       Em           G
Come tomorrow, I’ll be satisfied
D                    A             D
If I can catch that fast train and ride
 
G                                  D
So, make me down a pallet on your floor
G                                 D
Make me down a pallet on your floor
D        A       Em           G
Make me down a pallet soft and low
D                      A             D
Babe, I’m broke an’ I got nowhere to go
