[Intro]
G  Fmaj7  Em  C/G
 
 
[Verse 1]
G
Roll for initiative,
Fmaj7
The big bad evils here,
Em
 First the barbarian,
C/G
 They’d like to rage again.
 
 
[Verse 2]
G
They roll a natural one,
Fmaj7
No damage turn is done,
Em
The wizard makes a plan,
     C/G
They grab their staff with both their hands.
 
 
[Verse 3]
G
The bard starts to defend,
Fmaj7
Trying to protect their friends,
Em
Obstructing line of sight,
   C/G
By casting minor illusion.
 
 
[Verse 4]
G
The big bad evil swings,
Fmaj7
Nine points of bludgeoning,
Em
Had now it’s time we’ve enough
   C/G
The wizard raises their . . .,
 
 
[Pre-Chorus 1]
G         Am
Staff and chants,
          Em
The party braces themselves,
        C/E
If they can,
              G
They’re gonna turn,
     Am
This room,
       Em            C/E
Into a fiery ball of doom,
                   N.C.
The wizard casts a . . .,
N.C.
Not so fast, ha ha.
 
 
[Verse 5]
G
Big bad evil minions,
Fmaj7
Count er spell the wizard,
Em
They snuck behind your party,
Cadd9
Now you’re properly surrounded.
 
 
[Verse 6]
G
The big bad evil laughs,
Fmaj7
Your hit points won’t last,
Em
The party tries to run,
        Cadd9
They’re broken, beaten, fading fast.
 
 
[Verse 7]
G
The wizard looks around,
Fmaj7
No rescue can be found,
Em
If this is,
                    C/G
The end of the last thing they do
   C/G
Is take them down.
 
 
[Verse 8]
G
They feel a power surge,
Fmaj7
A most destructive urge,
Em
With one last look,
                  C/G
In their friend’s eyes,
C/G
The wizard raises his,
 
 
[Pre-Chorus 2]
G         Am
Staff and chants,
          Em
The party asks them to stop
         C/E
But they can’t,
              G
They’re gonna turn,
     Am
This room,
       Em            C/E
Into a fiery ball of doom,
 
 
[Chorus 1]
                   G   Am
The wizard casts a fireball,
                   Em      C/E
Don’t care if they hit you all,
                       G
They’re gonna make you go oh oh,
Am                           Em       C/E
 Please make your dex saving throw ro roll,
                   G   Am
The wizard casts a fireball,
                   Em      C/E
Don’t care if they hit you all,
                       G
They’re gonna make you go oh oh,
Am                           Em       C/E
 Please make your dex saving throw ro roll.
 
 
[Post-Chorus 1]
Em
Boom, boom, boom,
Em
They light up the entire,
Cadd9
Room, room, room,
Cadd9
The hope the party can pull,
G
Throu ou ough,
                         D
The smoke clears and the big bad says to you:
 
 
[Bridge]
 G          Am
“A fireball won’t kill me,
Em                              C
What did you think was going to happen,
G
I’m the big bad evil guy,
          Am
You can’t stop me,
Am
Wait hold on . . .
Em
Why are you smiling?”
 
 
[Chorus 2]
                         G   Am
The wizard casts another fireball,
                       Em    C/E
This time they give it their all,
                 G
The big bad evil screams,
      Am
In pain,
                             Em     C/E
The wizard sends them to the astral plane.
 
 
[Outro]
G
Boom, boom, boom,
Am
They light up the entire,
Em
Room, room, room,
Cadd9
It went motherfucking,
G
Boom, boom, boom,
Am
Cause they set fire to the
Em            C    C
Whole fucking room.
