[Intro]
F#m        D
Gleaming, twinkling
A          E      F#m       D
Eyes like sinking ships on waters
A              E
So inviting, I almost jump in
 
[Chorus]
F#m
I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
               D
I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
                  A
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
           E
Everybody wants you
                                           F#m
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
 
Walk past, quick brush
                   D
I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
                   A
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
           E
Everybody wants you but I don't like a gold rush
 
[Verse 1]
G                D                    A
What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
 
With your hair falling into place like dominos
G           D                  A
  I see me padding across your wooden floors
 
With my Eagles t-shirt hanging from the door
G                               D                       A
  At dinner parties, I call you out on your contrarian shit
                                                                  G
And the coastal town we wandered 'round had nеver seen a love as pure as it
             D                         E
And thеn it fades into the gray of my day-old tea ‘cause it could never be
 
[Chorus]
      F#m
Cause I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
               D
I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
                  A
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
           E
Everybody wants you
                                           F#m
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
 
Walk past, quick brush
                   D
I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
                   A
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
           E
Everybody wants you but I don't like a gold rush
 
[Verse 2]
G                D                    A
What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
 
With your hair falling into place like dominos
G                D              A
  My mind turns your life into folklore
 
I can't dare to dream about you anymore
G                                     D                      A
  At dinner parties I won't call you out on your contrarian shit
                                                              G
And the coastal town we never found will never see a love as pure as it
          D                         E
'Cause it fades into the gray of my day-old tea ‘cause it will never be
 
[Outro]
F#m        D
Gleaming, twinkling
A          E      F#m       D
Eyes like sinking ships on waters
A              E
So inviting, I almost jump in
