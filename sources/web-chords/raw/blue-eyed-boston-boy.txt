[Verse]
       D                C
He was just a blue-eyed Boston boy
    C                  G
His voice was low with pain
     D               C
I'll do your bidding comrade mine
   C               G
If You will do the same
       D               G
But if you ride on and I should fall
       D              D
You'll do as much for me
   D                  C
My mother at home is awaiting the news
   C                  G
So write to her tenderly
      D                      C
She's waiting at home like a patient saint
    C                     G
Her pale face filled with woe
    D                         C
Her heart will be broken when I am dead
     C               G
I'll see her face no more
     D              G
Just then the order came to charge
    D                   D
For moment hand touched hand
     D                C
They answered aye and on they rode
     C                 G
That brave and devoted band

[Verse]
         D                         C
Straight way was the course to the top of the hill
                            G
And the rebels was shot and shelled
       D                       C
Plowed furrows of death in the toiling ranks
                         G
And guarded them as they fell
      D                    G
There soon came a horrible dying sound
         D
From the heights they could not gain
    D                   C
And those that doom and death had spared
     C           G
Rode slowly back again
     D                    C
But among the dead at the top of the hill
        C                   G
Lay the boy with the golden hair
        D                 C
And the tall dark man who rode by his side
    C                G
Lay still beside him there
          D                    G
There was none to write to his blue-eyed girl
    D                   D
The words her lover had said
      D                  C
While mother at home is awaiting her son
       C              G
she'll only find he's dead
      D                  C
While mother at home is awaiting her son
       C              G
she'll only find he's dead
