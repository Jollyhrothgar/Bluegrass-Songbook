[Verse 1]
     G
Well down the road a mile or three
  C                F
A graveyard by the hickory tree
G
Laid ‘em down with all their sorrow
C             G
Down in Happy Hollow
 
G  C F
G  C G
 
     G
Well listen close you’ll hear the call
    C                       F
It’ all for one and one for y’all
      G
There ain’t no time to weep and wallow
C             G
Down on Happy Hollow
 
G  C F
G  C G
 
[Chorus 1]
C                        G
As the years keep flying by
C                     G    C
Still a rocky road to roam
                      G   F
Like a Sparrow to the sky
                             D
I’ll always find my way back home

[Verse 2]
     G
Well solemn judge he comes around
C                F
All the way from Nashville town
G
Looking for a swig to swallow
C             G
Down on Happy Hollow
 
G  C F
G  C G
 
         G
Well the sign out on the front door reads
C               F
Leave a list of what you need
   G
If I ain’t here come back tomorrow
C             G
Down on Happy Hollow
 
G  C F
G  C G
 
[Chorus 2]
C                        G
As the years keep flying by
C                     G    C
Still a rocky road to roam
                      G   F
Like a Sparrow to the sky
                             D
I’ll always find my way back homе
 
G  C F
G  C G
 
[Verse 3]
  G
A rusted tin roof in the rain
C            F
Cabin down a grandma lane
G
If you lеad, I’ll surely follow
C             G
Back to Happy Hollow
 
G  C F
