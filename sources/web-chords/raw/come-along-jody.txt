[Intro]
Cm Fm (x3)
Cm
 
[Verse 1]
Cm                  Fm
Come along, catch a Heffalump,
Cm               Fm
Sit with me on a muddy clump,
Cm                   G         Cm
We'll sing a song of days gone by.
 
Cm             Fm
Run along now, don’t be glum,
Cm                 Fm
Get you gone, now, have some fun,
Cm                     G      Cm
Don't be long, for the end is nigh.
 
Fm        Eb      Fm   Eb
Don't let moments pass along
Fm        Eb          G
And waste before your eyes;
 
Cm                    Fm
March with me and the borogoves,
Cm                   Fm
Come with me and the slithy toves,
Cm        G      Cm
And never ask us why.
 
[Chorus]
Ab                Cm
Come, come, come, come, come along now,
Ab                Cm
Run away from the hum-drum,
Ab            Cm
We'll go to a place that is safe from
G                Cm
Greed, anger and boredom.
Ab              Cm
We'll dance and sing till sundown,
Ab             Cm
And feast with abandon,
Ab                   Cm
We'll sleep when the morning comes,
          G                        Cm
And we'll rise by the sound of the birdsongs.
 
[Verse 2]
Cm                     Fm
We'll be here when the world slows down,
        Cm       Fm    Cm
And the sunbeams fade away,
Cm                Fm
Keeping time by a pendulum
       Cm               Fm
As the fabric starts to fray.
 
        Fm      Eb       Fm      Eb
There’s no such thing as time to kill,
    Fm       Eb   G
Nor time to throw away,
    Cm           Fm          Cm            Fm
So, once for the bright sky, twice for the pig sty,
Cm         G       Cm
Thrice for another day.
 
[Chorus]
Ab                Cm
Come, come, come, come, come along now,
Ab                Cm
Run away from the hum-drum,
Ab            Cm
We'll go to a place that is safe from
G                Cm
Greed, anger and boredom.
Ab              Cm
We'll dance and sing till sundown,
Ab             Cm
And feast with abandon,
Ab                   Cm
We'll sleep when the morning comes,
          G                        Cm
And we'll rise by the sound of the birdsongs.
 
[Instrumental]
Fm Cm (x4)
 
[Verse 3]
Cm                    Fm
Come with me, catch a rare type specimen,
Cm               Fm
Cuddle up with a hesitant skeleton,
Cm              G         Cm
We'll break our fast with friends.
 
Cm                       Fm
Once we're fed, we shall disappear rapidly,
Cm                Fm
Many moons to the west of here and happily,
Cm          G     Cm
Our journey never ends.
 
Fm        Eb        Fm     Eb
Shut your ears when sirens sing,
    Fm       Eb       G
Tie armbands to your feet;
 
Cm                Fm
Listen up and you won't go wrong again,
Cm               Fm
Float along on a verse-less song and then,
Cm               G        Cm
Get to where the two ends meet.
 
[Chorus]
Ab                Cm
Come, come, come, come, come along now,
Ab                Cm
Run away from the hum-drum,
Ab            Cm
We'll go to a place that is safe from
G                Cm
Greed, anger and boredom.
Ab              Cm
We'll dance and sing till sundown,
Ab             Cm
And feast with abandon,
Ab                   Cm
We'll sleep when the morning comes,
          G                        Cm
And we'll rise by the sound of the birdsongs.
