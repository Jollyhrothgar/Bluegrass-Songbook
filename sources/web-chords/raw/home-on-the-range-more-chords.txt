[Verse]
 
    D                        G       Gm
Oh, give me a home where the buffalo roam,
          D            E7       A7
Where the deer and the antelope play.
      D                    G         Gm
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word,
        D             A7         D
And the skies are not cloudy all day.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
D     A7          D
Home, home on the range,
          D            E7       A7
Where the deer and the antelope play.
      D                    G         Gm
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word,
        D             A7         D
And the skies are not cloudy all day.
 
 
(Additional verses, can play as you choose, with chorus after each one)
 
          D                       G          Gm
Where the air is so pure, and the zephyrs so free,
    D          E7        A7
The breezes so balmy and light,
       D                     G           Gm
That I would not exchange my home on the range,
    D          A7        D
For all of the cities so bright.
 
    D                       G           Gm
How often at night when the heavens are bright,
         D              E7         A7
With the light from the glittering stars,
       D                      G          Gm
Have I stood there amazed and asked as I gazed,
         D       A7            D
If their glory exceeds that of ours.
 
      D                               G            Gm
Oh, I love these wild flowers in this dear land of ours,
    D        E7           A7
The curlew I love to hear cry,
      D                            G        Gm
And I love the white rocks and the antelope flocks,
     D            A7              D
That graze on the mountain slopes high.
 
    D                        G              Gm
Oh, give me a land where the bright diamond sand,
      D         E7          A7
Flows leisurely down in the stream;
          D                        G        Gm
Where the graceful white swan goes gliding along,
       D         A7       D
Like a maid in a heavenly dream.
 
       D                     G           Gm
Then I would not exchange my home on the range,
          D            E7       A7
Where the deer and the antelope play;
      D                    G         Gm
Where seldom is heard a discouraging word,
        D             A7         D
And the skies are not cloudy all day.
