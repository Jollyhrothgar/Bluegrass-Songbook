C                                               G
Well, Rattler was a good old dog as blind as he could be
                                                       C
But every night at suppertime I believe that dog could see
 
 
[Chorus]
    C                                     G
Oh, here Rattler here, here. Here Rattler here
                                              C
Call old Rattler from the barn, here Rattler, here

Well, Rattler treed the other night, and I thought he treed a coon
                                             C
When I come to find out, he's barkin' at the moon
 
 
[Chorus]
    C                                     G
Oh, here Rattler here, here. Here Rattler here

        C                                         G
Well my Grandma had a muley cow, muley when she's born
                                                   C
It took a jaybird forty years, to fly from horn to horn
 
 
[Chorus]
    C                                     G

        C                                              G
Well my Grandma had a yellow hen, she set her eggs you know
                                                      C
Set her on some buzzard eggs, she hatched out one old crow

[Verse 5]
     C                                                G
Well if I had a needle and thread, as fine as I could sew
                                                       C
I'd sew my true-love to my coat, and down the road I'd go
 
 
[Chorus]
    C                                     G
Oh, here Rattler here, here. Here Rattler here
