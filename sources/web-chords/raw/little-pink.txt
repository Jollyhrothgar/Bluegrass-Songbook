[Intro]
 
G   C G   (x4)
 
When you're doing the intro, just let off the A string for that Johnny Cougar feel...
 
 
[Verse]
 
G
  There's a black man, with a black cat
G
Living in a black neighborhood
          G
He's got a interstate running through his front yard
              F             C          G
You know he thinks he's....got it so good.
              G                      G
And there's a woman, in the kitchen, cleaning up the evening slop
         F
And he looks at 'er and says
         C                           G
Hey Darlin' I remember when you could, stop a clock
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                   C                G
But ain't that America, for you and me
                 C                 G
Ain't that America, somethin' to see baby
                 C                 D
Ain't that America, home of the free
                        C                            G
Little Pink Houses for you and me, yeah for you and me
 
G   C G   (x2)
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
              G                        G
Now there's a young man, in a t-shirt, listening to a rock and rollin' station
        G
He's got greasy hair and a, greasy smile,
         F             C              G
he says "Lord this must be my destination"
          G                                   G
Cause he told me, when I was younger, sayin' "Boy ya gonna be President"
               F                      C                           G
But just like everything else, those crazy dreams, kinda came and went
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                   C                G
But ain't that America, for you and me
                 C                 G
Ain't that America, somethin' to see baby
                 C                 D
Ain't that America, home of the free
                        C                            G
Little Pink Houses for you and me, yeah for you and me
 
 
[Instrumental]
 
G   C G   (x3)
 
F   C   G     (x4)
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
             G                      G
Now there's people, and more people, and what do they know know know
G                                    F                  C           G
 Go to work in some high-rise, and vacation down at the Gulf of Mexico! (ooooh yeah)
             G                          G
And there's winners, and there's losers, but that ain't no big deal
          F                          C                        G
Cause the simple man, baby, pays for thrills, with bills, and pills that kill
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                       C                G
Ah, but ain't that America, for you and me
                 C                 G
Ain't that America, somethin' to see baby
                 C                 D
Ain't that America, home of the free
                        C                 G
Little Pink Houses for you and me, ooooh
 
               C                G
Ain't that America, for you and me
                 C                 G
Ain't that America, somethin' to see baby
                 C                 D
Ain't that America, home of the free
                                    C                                     G
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, Little Pink Houses for you and me
