"High On A Mountain" by Del McCoury
 
 
[Verse]
        G              D           G
As I looked at the valleys down below 
                         D              G
They were green just as far as I could see. 
                F          G                 C
As my memory returned, oh how my heart did yearn 
     G           D               G
for you and the day that used to be. 
 
 
[Chorus]
G            F        G              C
High on a mountain oh, wind blowin' free 
 G                  D                G
Thinking about the days that used to be. 
             F        G               C
High on a mountain oh, standin' all alone 
G                     D                    G
Wondering where the years of my life has flown. 
 
 
[Verse]
      G                   D       G
Oh I wonder if you ever think of me 
                        D            G
or if time has blotted out your memory. 
                     F              G                   C
As I listen to the breeze, whisper gently through the trees 
     G              D                 G
I'll always cherish what you meant to me. 
 
 
[Chorus]
G            F        G              C
High on a mountain oh, wind blowin' free 
 G                  D                G
Thinking about the days that used to be. 
             F        G               C
High on a mountain oh, standin' all alone 
G                     D                    G
Wondering where the years of my life has flown. 
 
 
[Chorus]
G            F        G              C
High on a mountain oh, wind blowin' free 
 G                  D                G
Thinking about the days that used to be. 
             F        G               C
High on a mountain oh, standin' all alone 
G                     D                    G
Wondering where the years of my life has flown.
