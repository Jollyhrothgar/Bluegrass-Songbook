[Intro]
| C      | G      | Bb     | F      | C      | C   F  | G      | C      |

[Verse 1]
C
Dream, I dream a dream of you
  Bb
A tiny dancer in a field of blue
  C                       F
A pointed toe Tchaikovsky play
   G                C
To bend you down so lowly
          C
It's your raven hair that makes me mad
     Bb
Your insane eyes that make me sad
    C                                       F
The California feeling and the Mississippi smile
     G                 C
That makes me come on slowly
 
 
[Chorus]
     C                 G
It's trying to be real cool and soft
     Bb                        F
So I won't take the chance and turn you off
    C                                      F
And not to get to know you just because of love
     G                 C
That makes me come on slowly
   C                             G
It isn't that I wouldn't want to make it all come true
   Bb                           F
Oh baby, if I had the chance to be alone with you
     C                                           F
It's watching how you operate when the chips are down
     G                 C
That makes me come on slowly
