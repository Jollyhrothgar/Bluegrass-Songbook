HIGH ROAD
As recorded by Zach Bryan
(2024 release)
 
 
Capo 4th fret
 
 
[Intro]
A7sus4  Fmaj7  Cadd9  Fmaj7
 
 
[Verse 1]
C                                 Fmaj7
Adderall and white-lace bras that makes you fall in love
    C                              Fmaj7
You left your blue jeans in my pickup truck
C                          Fmaj7
New York this time of year ain't good for me
       C                                    Fmaj7
’Cause all my friends lack self-control and empathy
C                                 Fmaj7
All the boys are crawlin' in some shithole in the wall again
  Cmaj7                  G                Fmaj7
I missed this place more than I missed my home
C                           Fmaj7
Everyone is tellin' me that I need help or therapy
    Cmaj7         G          Fmaj7
But all I need is to be left alone
 
 
[Chorus]
Fmaj7                        C
She’s bound to come back and haunt you forever
        G                         Am
There's ghosts in the windows and walls
     Fmaj7                   C
I'vе waited by the telеphone all fuckin' night
    G                             Am
For someone that ain't ever gonna call
 
 
[Interlude]
Fmaj7  C  G  Am
 
 
[Verse 2]
C                G        Fmaj7
Remember tellin' me I was gonna hit the big time
    C               G               Fmaj7
You died, guess you told God it was true
  C              G                  Fmaj7
Remember sittin' on your porch, you talked about your old regrets
   C               G                    Fmaj7
In Tulsa while the bad things took your brain
   C         G                 Fmaj7
It seems the quiet dreams have gotten much too heavy
        C                 G                    Fmaj7
But I'm home now and I’ll hold you through the pain
 
 
[Chorus]
Fmaj7                        C
She’s bound to come back and haunt you forever
        G                         Am
There's ghosts in the windows and walls
     Fmaj7                   C
I'vе waited by the telеphone all fuckin' night
    G                             Am
For someone that ain't ever gonna call
 
 
[Instrumental Break]
Fmaj7  C  G  Am
Fmaj7  C  G  Am
 
 
[Chorus]
Fmaj7                        C
She’s bound to come back and haunt you forever
        G                         Am
There's ghosts in the windows and walls
     Fmaj7                   C
I'vе waited by the telеphone all fuckin' night
    G                             Am
For someone that ain't ever gonna call
 
 
[Interlude]
Fmaj7  C  G  Am
 
 
[Outro]
C            G                    Fmaj7
Adderall and white-lace bras that makes you fall in love
    C              G               Fmaj7
You left your blue jeans in my pickup truck
C             G            Fmaj7
New York this time of year ain't good for me
       C                   G                Fmaj7
’Cause all my friends lack self-control and empathy
