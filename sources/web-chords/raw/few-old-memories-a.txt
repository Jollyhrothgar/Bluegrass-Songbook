G
Just a few old memories 
                      C
Slipped in through my door 
                       G
Though I thought I had closed it 
           D
So tightly before 
             G
I can't understand it 
                        C
Why it should bother my mind 
           G          D                 G
For it all belongs to another place and time 
 
G              C
Just a few old keep-sakes 
                G
Way back on the shelf 
                    C
No, they don't mean nothin' 
                                 D
Well I'm surprised they're still left 
                    G
Just a few old love letters 
                   C
With the edges all brown 
                 G
And an old faded picture 
       D             G
I keep turned upside-down 
 
G C G D G
 
G
Just a few old memories 
                  C
Going way back in time 
                  G
Well I can hardly remember 
                     D
I don't know why I'm cryin' 
             G
I can't understand it 
                   C
Well I'm surprised myself 
                    G
First thing tomorrow morning 
     D              G
I'll clean off that shelf 
 
G              C
Just a few old keep-sakes 
                G
Way back on the shelf 
                    C
No, they don't mean nothin' 
                                 D
Well I'm surprised they're still left 
                    G
Just a few old love letters 
                   C
With the edges all brown 
                 G
And an old faded picture 
       D             G
I keep turned upside-down
