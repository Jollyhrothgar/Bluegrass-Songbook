[Intro]
C    Am    C    Am
 
[Verse]
     C         Am              C
It's quite this evening on the old Canadian
   F C          G
As I ride out alone
    Am         Em           F        C
I'm lonely but free just my pony and me
         F       G         C    Am    C    Am
and the river is singing a song
 
[Verse]
    C         Am
Got Plenty of rain
   C                 C7
the grass is growing tall
    F        C        G
the river is rolling along
    Am         Em      F              C
the cattle are fat the calves looking good
     F             G           C   Am   C   Am
just laying around waiting for fall
 
[Verse]
   C      Am         C
As I ride out on the point of a mesa
  F              C        G
I survey all the beauty below
   Am            Em          F              C
an eagle screams down to his friends on the ground
    F        G         C     Am
It's time to be bedin' down
 
[Verse]
     C          Am             C             C7
That old settin sun paints its colors on the mesas
    F       C            G
and all the river canyon walls
     Am            Em       F
From somewhere far away the coyote calls its mate
      Dm     G          C    Am   C   Am
It's time to be headin' home
 
[Verse]
    C               Am            C    C7
The moon is shining bright on the old Canadian
     F            C          G
as I jog down the canyon for home
    Am         Em           F        C
I'm lonely but free just my pony and me
  F         G              Am
A cowboy at peace with the world
F     C         F              C    Am
I'm a cowboy at peace with the world
 
[Outro]
C   Am   C   Am   C
