(On the record, those X/Y chords are almost certainly played as a standard X
chord on guitar, with the bass covering the Y note; the fingerings suggested
above are for anyone who wants to replicate the overall sound of those chords
on a single guitar. And, incidentally, Laura Nyro was using major triads
with the fourth in the bass when Don and Walt were still playing frat parties
at Bard.)

[Verse 1]
            Em7
We're gonna break out the hats and hooters when Josie comes home
 
We're gonna rev up the motorscooters
                 A/D     G/C
When Josie comes home to stay
            D/G         C/F
We're gonna park in the street
Em7
Sleep on the beach and make it
A7                          G/C   D/G C/F
Throw down the jam 'til the girls say when
Em7                  D/G           E/A         Em7
Lay down the law and break it when Josie comes home
 
[Chorus 1]
     C/F        F#7#9  B7#5#9    Em7   C/F
When Josie comes home         so good
          F#7#9        B7#5#9       Em7  A7
She's the pride of the neighborhood
          Am7  D7       Gmaj7 Cmaj7
She's the raw flame, the live wire
    F#7#9                      B7#5#9
She prays like a Roman with her eyes on fire
 
[Verse 2]
            Em7
Jo would you love to scrapple, she'll never say no
 
Shine up the battle apple
                 A/D     G/C
We'll shake 'em all down tonight
            D/G         C/F
We're gonna mix in the street
Em7
Strike at the stroke of midnight
A7                          G/C   D/G C/F
Dance on the bones till the girls say when
Em7                  D/G           E/A         Em7
Pick up what's left by daylight when Josie comes home
 
[Chorus 2]
When Josie comes home, so bad
She's the best friend we never had
She's the raw flame, the live wire
She prays like a Roman with her eyes on fire
