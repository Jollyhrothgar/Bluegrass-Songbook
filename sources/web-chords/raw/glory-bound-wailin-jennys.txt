Capo 7th fret
 
intro: Mandolin
 
When I hear that trumpet sound
I will lay my burdens down            }1st verse is just lead and mandolin
I will lay them deep into the ground
Then I'll know that I am glory bound

G                         C
I'll be traveling far from home
G                            C
But I won't be looking for to roam
D                          Em    G
I'll be crossing o'er the great divide
D                        C      G
In a better home soon I will reside
 
 
G    C  G
Hallelujah
G   *C   Bm A  C*               *This is just walking from C back up to C*
Hallelu--u--u--jah              *Walking is playing individual notes on a
G    C  G                        string. So C B A are the notes that you play
Hallelujah                       on the A string. The ones on hallelujah that
G    C   Bm A  G                 I wrote were the chords but I play the
Hallelu--u--u--jah               notes. It's easier than it sounds.*
 
 
G                      C
When I'm in my resting place
G                        C
I'll look on my mother's face
D                 Em       G
Never more will I have to know
D                       C          G
All the loneliness that plagues me so
 
G                                C
So I'm waiting for that train to come
G                             C
And I know where she's coming from
D                       Em     G
Listen can you hear her on the track
D                       C       G
When I board I won't be looking back
 
 
G    C  G
Hallelujah
G    C   Bm A  C
Hallelu--u--u--jah
G    C  G
Hallelujah
G    C   Bm A  G
Hallelu--u--u--jah        (Repeat)
 
 
Play through last verse twice then end on G)
