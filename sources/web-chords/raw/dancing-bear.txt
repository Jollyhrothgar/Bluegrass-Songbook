The Dancing Bear
The Mamas & The Papas
 
[Intro]
Am
 
[Verse 1]
    Am                    Em                Am                 Em
 I wouldn't want to be a chimney sweep all black from head to foot
      Am               C            Am                 E
 From climbing in them chimneys and cleaning out that soot
        E         Dm          E     E           Dm       E
 With a broom and ladder and pail, the darkened walls I scale,
 Dm   E   Dm   E   Dm  Am E  Am   E  Am
 And far, and high, I see a patch of sky.
 
[Chorus]
 
   Am                Em           Am                 Em
 I'd rather be the gypsy who's camped at the edge of town,
     Am              C                 Am            E
 The one who has the dancing bear that follows him around.
        E         Dm       E       E           Dm       E
 And he lifts his big foot up, and he puts his big foot down,
 Dm   E    Dm   E      Dm  Am E      Am   E   Am
 And bows, and twirls, and dances 'round and 'round.
 
[Verse 2]
   Am            Em             Am             Em
 I found I was a cabin boy last night as I did dream.
 Am           C                Am              E
 Bound upon a magic ship for a land I'd never seen.
         E        Dm          E             E          Dm          E
 And the moon she filled our sails, and the stars they steered our course
 Dm   E Dm   E    Dm  Am  E  Am E  Am
 And on our bow there was a golden horse.
 
[Verse 3]
 
     Am               Em         Am               Em
 The queen eats sugar candy, the bishop, nuts and cheese.
     Am          C               Am                 E
 And when I am a grown man, I'll taste just what I please;
     E     Dm       E        E         Dm       E
 The honey from the bee, the shellfish from the sea,
     E          Am     E         Dm      Am    E      Am    E   Am
 The earth, the wind a girl, someone to share these things with me.
 
[Chorus]
 
   Am                    Em                Am                 Em
 I wouldn't want to be a chimney sweep all black from head to foot
      Am               Em           Am                Em
 From climbing in them chimneys and cleaning out that soot.
     Am            Em          Am                    Em
 I'd rather be the gypsy who's camped at the edge of town,
     Am              Em                Am           Em
 The one who has the dancing bear that follows him around.
