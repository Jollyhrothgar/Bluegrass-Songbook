[Intro]
G G G G
G G D D
G G C C
G D G G
 
[Verse]
G
Now you just told me that you’re leaving
                         D
On the next train coming down
G                           C
I love you dear but I won’t follow
G      D          G
I just think I’ll stay around
 
[Chorus]
G
For I know someday you’ll want me
                             D
When your true love can’t be found
G                          C
But if you go dear I won’t follow
G      D          G
I just think I’ll stay around
 
[Verse]
G
Now you know dear I’ve always love you
                        D
And would never let you down
G                          C
But if you go dear I won’t follow
G      D          G
I just think I’ll stay around
 
[Verse]
G
Someday I’ll hear that whistle blowing
                      D
On the special coming down
G                        C
You’ll be looking for me baby
G     D       G
But I may not be around
