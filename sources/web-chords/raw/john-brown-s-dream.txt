[Intro]
Gm C7
 
[Verse 1]
     Gm                        C7                   Gm
I've always been a rambler, my fortune's been quite hard.
Gm                            C7                 Gm
Always loved the women, drink whiskey and played cards.
   Gm                                 C7             G7
My parents treated me kindly, as they had no boy but me
   Gm                            C7               Gm
My mind was bent on rambling, at home I couldn't agree.
 
Gm C7 Gm
 
[Verse 2]
      Gm                       C7                   Gm
There was a wealthy farmer who lived in the country by
   Gm                           C7            Gm
He had one handsome daughter on who I cast an eye
    Gm                           C7            Gm
She was so tall and handsome, so pretty and so fair
      Gm                                    C7             Gm
There ain't one girl in the wide world with her I could compare
 
Gm C7 Gm
 
[Verse 3]
     Gm                                 C7                Gm
So I asked if it made any difference if I walked o'er the way
    Gm                          C7         Gm
She said to me no difference so you return again
    Gm                                 C7             Gm
She said that she'd prove true to me until I proved unkind
   Gm                           C7                Gm
So I shook hands and parted and left that girl behind
 
Gm C7 Gm
 
[Verse 4]
  Gm                          C7           Gm
I left old North Carolina, to Marion I did go
     Gm                        C7                  Gm
Then on to Johnson City, gonna see this wide world o'er
      Gm                                   C7             Gm
Where work and money was plentiful and the women treat me kind
    Gm                              C7          Gm
The only object of my heart was the girl I left behind
 
Gm C7 Gm
 
[Verse 5]
 
  Gm                           C7            Gm
I rambled out one evening down on the public square
    Gm                             C7              Gm
The mail had just arriven when the post-boy met me there
   Gm                          C7               Gm
He handed me a letter which he gives me to understand
    Gm                            C7              Gm
The girl I'd left in Carolina had married another man
 
Gm C7 Gm
 
[Verse 6]
 
  Gm                            C7                  Gm
I read a few lines further 'til I found that it was true
   Gm                               C7                  Gm
My heart was filled with trouble, I didn't know what to do
   Gm                                 C7              Gm
My heart was filled with trouble, and trouble's on my mind
   Gm                                 C7         Gm
I'm goin' to drink and gamble for the one I left behind
 
 
[Outro]
Gm C7 Gm
