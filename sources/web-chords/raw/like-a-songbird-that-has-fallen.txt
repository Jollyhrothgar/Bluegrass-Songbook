[Intro]
C  C  F C G C  F C F C
 
[Verse 1]
 C                  F      C       F             C    G
Paths are there for us to follow,This is gospel I believe
 C           F        C                     G     C
Angels are around us flying,truth and mercy to recieve
 C           F        C      F            C       G
Pictures of uncommon nature,painted by a masters hand
 C           F         C        F               G      C
Draw me ever on life's journey,rendered thus to understand
 
 
[Chorus]
 G             C        F    C         F         G
As a songbird that is fallen only to regain the sky, 
 C         F     C              F       G    C
from this frozen shadow valley may my spirit fly
 
 
[Verse 2]
 C               F        C         F           C        G
Love is from no distance calling,faithful as the rising sun
 C               F          C                         G      C
Warms the bitter heart and heartache,till the east of eden's gone
 C                  F             C              F      G
Clouds of fear and misconception,wax and wane as if the moon
 C          F        C     F               G      C
So is in a sense forsaken,till the will of God be known
 
 
 
[Chorus]
 G             C        F    C         F         G
As a songbird that is fallen only to regain the sky, 
 C         F     C             F      G      C
from this frozen shadow valley may my spirit fly
