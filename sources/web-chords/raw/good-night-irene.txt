[Verse 1]
  G                     D
I asked your mother for you
    D7                       G
She told me that you was too young
  G                             C
I wish dear Lord that I'd never seen your face
    G              D        G
I'm sorry that you ever was born
 
[Chorus]
G          D
Irene, goodnight
D7         G
Irene, goodnight
   G                  C
Goodnight, Irene, goodnight, Irene
  G       D7    G
I get you in my dreams
 
[Verse 2]
    G                          D
Sometimes I live in the country
    D7              G
Sometimes I live in town
    G                    C
Sometimes I take a great notion
        G        D         G
To jump into the river and drown
 
[Chorus]
G          D
Irene, goodnight
D7         G
Irene, goodnight
   G                  C
Goodnight, Irene, goodnight, Irene
  G       D7    G
I get you in my dreams
 
[Verse 3]
     G                 D
Stop rambling and stop gambling
     D7                  G
Stop staying out late at night
   G                          C
Go home to your wife and your family
    G       D            G
Sit down by the fireside bright
 
[Chorus]
G          D
Irene, goodnight
D7         G
Irene, goodnight
   G                  C
Goodnight, Irene, goodnight, Irene
  G       D7    G
I get you in my dreams
 
[Verse 4]
  G               D
I love Irene, God knows I do
     D7                         G
I'll love her till the seas run dry
G                        C
If Irene should turn her back on me
    G        D            G*** *
I'd take the morphine and die
 
 
NOT IN THIS RECORDING
 
[Verse 4]
  G                     D
Last Saturday night, I got married
    D7                      G
Me and my wife settled down
  G                            C
Now me and my wife are parted
    D                       G
I'm gonna take another stroll downtown
