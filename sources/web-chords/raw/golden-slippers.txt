[verses 1]
       G
Oh, my golden slippers am laid away
                                         D
‘Cause I don’t expect to wear ’em til my wedding day
       D
And my long tailed coat, that I love so well
                                     G
I will wear up in the chariot in the morning
       G
And my long white robe that I bought last June
                                   D
I’m goin’ to get changed ’cause it fits too soon
        D
And the old grey hoss that I used to drive
                                       G
I will hitch him to the chariot in the morning

Oh, them golden slippers
D
Golden slippers I’m goin’ to wear
  G
Because they look so neat
 
G
Oh, them golden slippers
C
Oh, them golden slippers
D
Golden slippers I’m goin’ to wear
                   G
To walk the golden street

[Verse 2]
    G
Oh, my old banjo hangs on the wall
                                 D
‘Cause it ain’t been tuned since way last fall
        D
But the folks all say we’ll have a good time
                                      G
When we ride up in the chariot in the morning
        G
There’s ol’ brother Ben and his sister, Luce
                                      D
They will telegraph the news to uncle Bacco Juice
       D
What a great camp meetin’ there will be that day
                                      G
When we ride up in the chariot in the morning
 
 
[Chorus]
G
Oh, them golden slippers
C
Oh, them golden slippers
D
Golden slippers I’m goin’ to wear
  G
Because they look so neat
 
G
Oh, them golden slippers
C
Oh, them golden slippers
D
Golden slippers I’m goin’ to wear
                   G
To walk the golden street
