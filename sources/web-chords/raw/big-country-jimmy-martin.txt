Big Country – In a Big Country
 
E – A – C#m – F#m
 
E     A
      Come up screaming…
C#m     A
        Come up screaming…
C#m – F#m
 
E . . .
 
E                               A
  I've never seen you look like this without a reason,
E                        A                F#m    A      B
  Another promise fallen through, another season passes by you.
 
B  –  A   –   F#m
       *shot!*
 
E                        A
  I never took the smile away from anybody's face,
E                               A                F#m     A      B
  And that's a desperate way to look for someone who is still a child.
 
[Hook]
C#m            E            A      B              C#m
      And in a big country, dreams stay with you,
        E       C#m             E       B
Like a lover's voice, fires the mountainside
A           F#m
      Stay alive
 
E – F#m
 
E                                     A
   I thought that pain and truth were things that really mattered
        C#m                  F#m                       E
But you can't stay here with every single hope you had shattered
 
E . . .
 
E                            A
   I'm not expecting to grow flowers in the desert,
E                                 A       F#m    A     B
   But I can live and breathe and see the sun in wintertime
 
[Hook]
C#m            E            A      B              C#m
      And in a big country, dreams stay with you,
        E       C#m             E       B
Like a lover's voice, fires the mountainside
A           F#m
      Stay alive
 
C#m            E            A      B              C#m
      And in a big country, dreams stay with you,
        E       C#m             E       B
Like a lover's voice, fires the mountainside
A           F#m
      Stay alive
 
E – A – C#m – F#m
 
E                           A
   So take that look out of here, it doesn't fit you.
C#m                               F#m
    Because it's happened doesn't mean you've been discarded
E                            A
   Pull up your head off the floor, come up screaming
C#m                           F#m
   Cry out for everything you ever might have wanted
E                                     A
   I thought that pain and truth were things that really mattered
        C#m                  F#m                       E
But you can't stay here with every single hope you had shattered
 
E . . .
 
E                            A
   I'm not expecting to grow flowers in the desert,
E                                 A       F#m    A     B
   But I can live and breathe and see the sun in wintertime

C#m            E            A      B              C#m
      And in a big country, dreams stay with you,
        E       C#m             E       B
Like a lover's voice, fires the mountainside
A           F#m
      Stay alive
 
C#m            E            A      B              C#m

        E       C#m             E       B
Like a lover's voice, fires the mountainside
A           F#m
      Stay alive
