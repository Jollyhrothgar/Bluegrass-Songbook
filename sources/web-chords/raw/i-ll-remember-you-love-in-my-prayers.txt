[Intro]
G C G F G D G
 
 
[Verse 1]
G
When the curtains of night are pinned back by the stars
                                  C
And the beautiful moon sweeps the sky
G                                    F
Dewdrops from Heaven are kissin' the rose
     G            D      G
It's then that my memory flies
 
 
[Break]
G C G F G D G
 
 
[Verse 2]
G
Well, upon the wings of a beautiful dove
                            C
I'll hasten this message of cheer
         G                                 F
And I'll bring you a kiss of affection and say
     G             D           G
I'll remember you, love, in my prayers
 
 
[Break]
G C G F G D G
 
 
[Verse 3]
G
Now the angels of Heaven are guarding the good
                            C
As God has ordained them to do
   G                                 F
In answer to prayers that I offer to Him
  G                D           G
I know there's one waiting for you
 
 
[Break]
G C G F G D G
 
 
[Verse 4]
G
Now go where you will upon land or on sea
                                    C
And I'll share all your sorrows and cares
   G                                 F
At night as I kneel by my bedside to pray
     G             D           G
I'll remember you, love, in my prayers
 
 
[Break]
G C G F G D G
 
 
[Outro]
G                                         F
Well at night as I kneel by my bedside to pray
     G             D           G
I'll remember you, love, in my prayers
