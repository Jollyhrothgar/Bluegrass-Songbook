[Chorus]
  G                     D
Love me darlin' just tonight,
 D7                          G
take your arms and hold me tight
                         C
tomorrow you may hold another,
  G        D            G
love me darlin' just tonight.
 
[Verse 1]
  G                     D
Try to find true love in your heart
                         C
tomorrow we may not have to part.
  G        D            G
But if you feel you must leave me,
  G                     D
love me darlin' just tonight.
 
[Verse 2]
 D7                          G
You say tomorrow you are leavin'
                         C
I hope you know the way thats right
  G        D            G
I pray to god you won't leave me
  G                     D
love me darlin' just tonight.
