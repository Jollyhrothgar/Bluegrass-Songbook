Transcribed by Jason Neus (jason.d.neus@uwrf.edu)
 
Capo I
 
 
[Intro]
 
D
 
 
[Verse]
 
D                          G
Her telephone rang 'bout a quarter to nine
D                          A                G
She heard his voice on the other end of the line
                      A
She wondered what was wrong this time
D                       G
She never knew what his calls might bring
       D                        A
With a cowboy like him it could be anything
        G                   A                        D     A
And she always expected the worst in the back of her mind
 
D                               G
He said, it's cold out here and I’m all alone
D                           A                     G
I didn't make the short go, again, and I’m coming home
                 A
I know I’ve been away too long
D                       G
I never got a chance to write or call
      D                      A
And I know this rodeo's been hard on us all
G                         A                        D
But I’ll be home soon and honey is there something wrong
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G                     A
She said don't bother comin' home
       Bm7      A             G
By the time you get here I’ll be long gone
        D                   A                   G      A
There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man
G                      A
He said I’m sorry it's come down to this
        Bm7     A              G
There's so much about you that I’m gonna miss
         D                 A                      G
But it's alright baby if I hurry I can still make Cheyenne
      D                A                      G          A
Gotta go now baby if I hurry I can still make Cheyenne
 
 
[Verse]
 
D                           G
He left that phone danglin' off the hook
D                             A                G
Then slowly turned around and gave it one last look
             A
Then he just walked away
D                              G
He aimed his truck toward that Wyoming line
D                                 A
With a little luck he could still get there in time
G                    A                            D
And in that Cheyenne wind he could still hear her say
 
[Chorus]
 
G                     A
She said don't bother comin' home
       Bm7      A             G
By the time you get here I’ll be long gone
        D                   A                   G      A
There's somebody new and he sure ain't no rodeo man
G                      A
He said I’m sorry it's come down to this
        Bm7     A              G
There's so much about you that I’m gonna miss
         D                 A                      G
But it's alright baby if I hurry I can still make Cheyenne
      D                A                      G          A
Gotta go now baby if I hurry I can still make Cheyenne
 
 
[Verse]
 
D                       G
She never knew what his calls might bring
       D                        A
With a cowboy like him it could be anything
        G                   A                        D
And she always expected the worst in the back of her mind
 
[Outro]
 
D  G  D  A  G  A  D    D
