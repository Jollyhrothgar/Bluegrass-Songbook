Gum Tree Canoe
John Hartford
 
[Intro]
 
D  G  D  A
D  G  D  A D
 
{Verse]
 
D                           G            D
On the Tom big bee river so bright I was born
D                             A
In a hut made of husks of the tall yellow corn
   D                          G        D
An there I first meet with my Julia so true
                           A        D
An I row'd her about In my Gum Tree Canoe
 
 
[Chorus]
 
D                              G
Singing row away row, O'er the waters so blue
       A                           G        D
Like a feather we'll float, In our Gum Tree Canoe
D                              G
Singing row away row, O'er the water so blue
       A                           G        D
Like a feather we'll float, In our Gum Tree Canoe
 
 
[Verse]
 
D                             G        D
All day in the field the soft cotton I hoe
                        A
I think of my Julia and sing as I go
     D                        G            D
Oh I catch her a bird, with a wing of true blue
                                 A        D
An at night sail her round in my Gum Tree Canoe
 
 
[Chorus]
 
D                              G
Singing row away row, O'er the waters so blue
       A                           G        D
Like a feather we'll float, In our Gum Tree Canoe
D                              G
Singing row away row, O'er the water so blue
       A                           G        D
Like a feather we'll float, In our Gum Tree Canoe
 
 
[Verse]
 
D                              G          D
With my hands on the banjo and toe on the oar
                           A
I sing to the sound of the rivers soft roar;
          D                          G        D
While the stars they look down at my Julia so true
                            A        D
An' dance in her eye in our Gum Tree Canoe
 
 
[Chorus]
 
D                              G
Singing row away row, O'er the waters so blue
       A                           G        D
Like a feather we'll float, In our Gum Tree Canoe
D                              G
Singing row away row, O'er the water so blue
       A                           G        D
Like a feather we'll float, In our Gum Tree Canoe
 
 
[Verse]
 
D                            G      D
One night the stream bore us so far away
                                 A
That we couldn't come back so we thought we'd just stay,
       D                        G            D
Oh, we spied a tall ship with a flag of true blue,
                               A        D
And it took us in tow with our gum-tree canoe.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
D                              G
Singing row away row, O'er the waters so blue
       A                           G        D
Like a feather we'll float, In our Gum Tree Canoe
D                              G
Singing row away row, O'er the water so blue
       A                           G        D
Like a feather we'll float, In our Gum Tree Canoe
