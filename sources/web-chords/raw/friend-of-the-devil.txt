G                          C
I lit out from Reno, I was trailed by twenty hounds
G                                        C
Didn't get to sleep last night 'till the morning came around.
 
D
Set out runnin' but I take my time
  Am
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
   D                             Am                  C       D
If I get home before daylight, I just might get some sleep tonight.
 
G                            C
Ran into the devil, babe, he loaned me twenty bills
  G                            C
I spent the night in Utah in a cave up in the hills.
 
D
Set out runnin' but I take my time
  Am
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
   D                             Am                  C       D
If I get home before daylight, I just might get some sleep tonight.
 
  G                             C
I ran down to the levee but the devil caught me there
   G                              C
He took my twenty dollar bill and vanished in the air.
 
D
Set out runnin' but I take my time
  Am
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
   D                             Am                  C       D
If I get home before daylight, I just might get some sleep tonight.
 
D
Got two reasons why I cry away each lonely night,
    C
The first one's named Sweet Anne Marie, and she's my hearts delight.
    D
The second one is prison, babe, the sheriff's on my trail,
    Am                             C                D
And if he catches up with me, I'll spend my life in jail.
 
G                              C
Got a wife in Chino, babe, and one in Cherokee
    G                                      C
The first one says she's got my child, but it don't look like me.
 
D
Set out runnin' but I take my time
  Am
A friend of the devil is a friend of mine
   D                             Am                  C       D
If I get home before daylight, I just might get some sleep tonight.
