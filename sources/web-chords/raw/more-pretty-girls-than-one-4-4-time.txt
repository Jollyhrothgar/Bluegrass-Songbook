[Chorus]		 C                         C7 
	There's more pretty girls than one 
	  F                     C   C7 
	More pretty girls than one 
	 F                   C 
	Any old town that I ramble all around in 
	         C           G         C 
	There's more pretty girls than one 
 
   C              G        C   C7 
1. Mama talked to me last night 
2. Honey look down that old lonesome road 
 
        F                      C    C7 
1. She gave to me some good advice 
2. Hang down your pretty head and cry 
 
             F                               C 
1. She said "Son you ought to quit this old ramblin' all around 
2. 'Cause I'm thinking all about them pretty little gals 
 
        C           G            C 
1. And marry you a sweet loving wife" 
2. And hoping that I'll never die
