   A                  D  G    D
as time draws near my dearest dear 
                    Bm
when you and i must part
A                          D     G   D
how little you know of the grief and woe
                  Bm
in my poor aching heart
A                     D
each night i suffer for your sake
  Bm       A           Bm
believe me dear hearts true?
A                    D  G    D
i wish that you were staying here 
                    Bm
or I was going with you
 
 
 
A D Bm
 
 
 
A                     D  G    D
I wish my breast were made of glass 
                  Bm
wherein you might behold
A                  D    G    D
upon my heart your name lies wrote 
                   Bm
in letters made of gold
   D
in letters made of gold my love 
  Bm       A      Bm
believe me when i say
A                   D  G  D
You are the darling of my heart 
               Bm
until my dying day

A                      D  G D
the blackest crow that ever flew 
                     Bm
would surely turn to white
A               D     G  D
if ever i prove false to you 
                         Bm
bright day would turn to night
   D
bright day would turn to night my love 
  Bm       A      Bm
the elements will mourn
A               D     G  D
if ever i prove false to you 
                        Bm
the seas would rage and burn
 
A D Bm
A D Bm Gm
