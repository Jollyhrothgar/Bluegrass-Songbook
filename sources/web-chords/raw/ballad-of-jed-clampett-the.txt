THE BALLAD OF JED CLAMPETT - Earl Scruggs
 
[Verse 1]
G                              D7        D
Come listen to a story 'bout a man named Jed
   D7                       C              G
A poor mountaineer, barely kept his family fed
          G7          C               A7
Then one day he was shootin' at some food
    D                            D7       G
And up through the ground came a-bubblin' crude
 
Oil that is. Black gold. Texas tea.
 
[Verse 2]
G                                   D7           D
Well, the first thing you know old Jed's a millionaire
     D7                  G              G
The kin folks said "Jed move away from there"
                       C                  A7
Said "California's the place you ought to be"
         D                       D7       G
So they bundled up the truck and moved to Beverly
 
Hills that is. Swimmin' pools. Movie stars.
 
[Verse 3]
G                                      D7             D
Well, now it's time to say goodbye to Jed and all his kin
 D7                               C              G
They would like to thank you for kindly stoppin' in
                    G7                C         A7
You're all invited back next week to this locality
   D               D7               D        G
To have a heapin' helpin' of their hospitality
