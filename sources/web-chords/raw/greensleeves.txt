[Verse 1]
 Am     C         G     Em
Alas my love, you do me wrong,
   Am              E
to cast me off discourteously.
    Am     C     G      Em
For I have loved you so long,
  Am       E7       Am
delighting in your company.
 
[Chorus]
C                G      Em
Greensleeves was all my joy,
Am               E
Greensleeves was my delight,
C                   G        Em
Greensleeves was my heart of gold,
    Am         E7   Am
and who but my Lady Greensleeves.

   Am       C      G       Em
I have been readie at your hand,
    Am              E
to grant what ever you would crave.
   Am        C     G       Em
I have both waged life and land,
     Am            E7          Am
your love and good will for to have.
 
[Verse 3]
    Am        C      G     Em
Thy gown was of the grassy green,
      Am              E
thy sleeves of satin hanging by,
      Am        C       G       Em
Which made thee be our harvest queen,
 Am           E7          Am
And yet thou wouldst not love me.

C                G      Em
Greensleeves was all my joy,
Am               E
Greensleeves was my delight,
C                   G        Em
Greensleeves was my heart of gold,
    Am         E7   Am
and who but my Lady Greensleeves.

      Am     C       G      Em
Well, I will pray to God on high,
      Am            E
That thou constancy mayst see,
    Am       C      G      Em
And that yet once before I die,
 Am            E7       Am
Thou wilt vouchsafe to love me.

     C                G    Em
Greensleeves, now farewel adue,
Am             E
God I pray to prosper thee:
    C              G    Em
For I am stil thy lover true,
Am          E7       Am
come once againe and love me.
