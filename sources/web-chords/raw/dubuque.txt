[Verse 1]
       C
Do you remember Dubuque?
              G
Have you even heard of that?
     F            Dm           C         G
It's half between New York and California
           C
There is a highway in and back
         G
Plus and active railroad track
        F                Dm            C
And the west side of the city sells no liquor
 
[Pre-chorus 1]
      Em
And I can't recall the instances
     Bm
That keep it in my thoughts
     Em
City parks or nighttime girls
   Bm
Or ancient limestone rocks
 
[Chorus]
        C                   G
Writing songs of rights and wrongs
           A7
And buyin' penny loafer shoes
    C                G
Oh, definitely, most certainly
     D               A A A F#m Bm D G
I've got the Dubuque blues
 
[Verse 2]
       C
Do you remember Anna Sue?
              G
Have you even heard of that?
    F         Dm           C        G
She went from Tennessee to Minnesota
        C
She was thirteen and I was ten
       G
As the gentle Southern wind
      F                  Dm                  C
Would make the moonlight shatter through the maples
 
[Pre-chorus 2]
      Em
And I can recall the summers
        Bm
That we spent among the trees
           Em
When there were no Monday bummers
   Bm
To blow my life of ease
 
[Chorus]
        C                   G
Writing songs of rights and wrongs
           A7
And buyin' penny loafer shoes
    C                G
Oh, definitely, most certainly
     D               A A A F#m Bm D G
I've got the Dubuque Blues
 
[Bridge]
        Em                          Bm7
Now the Dubuque blues ain't news to anybody
          Em                             Bm7
Who knows sadness is the sweetest of the pain
        Em                              Bm7
Who can tell with just a look that it's all over
        Em                Bm
And who never cried, well almost never cried
 
[Verse 3]
       C
Do you remember nickel Cokes?
              G
Have you even heard of that?
        F                Dm      C       G
They're half between the 40s and tomorrow
       C
I once considered it my home
       G
Now, I know I'll always roam
         F                  Dm              C
And if I pass through there again I will be lucky
 
[Pre-chorus 3]
      Em
And I can't recall the instances
     Bm
They hung it in my thoughts
        Em
And I'm sure they're as important
       Bm
As the feelings that they brought
 
[Chorus]
        C                   G
Writing songs of rights and wrongs
           A7
And buyin' penny loafer shoes
    C                G
Oh, definitely, most certainly
     D               A A A F#m Bm D G
I've got the Dubuque blues
 
[Outro]
F F F F Amaj7
