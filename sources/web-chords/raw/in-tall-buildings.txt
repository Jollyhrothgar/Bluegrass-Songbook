[Verse 1]
C           G6         Am     C7
Someday, my baby, when I am a man
      F           G
And others have taught me
    C               G
The best that they can
         C        G6
They'll sell me a suit
     Am         C/G
And cut off my hair
     F          G              C      G
And send me to work in tall buildings
 
[Chorus]
    C                     G6
And it's goodbye to the sunshine
   Am            C7
Goodbye to the dew
    F             G
Goodbye to the flowers
      C         G
And goodbye to you
    C            G6
I'm off to the subway
    Am          C/G
I must not be late
 F        G              C       G
Going to work in tall buildings
 
[Verse 2]
 C            G6
Now when I retire
    Am            C7
And my life is my own
   F               G
I made all the payments
  C              G6
It's time to go home
     C              G6
And wonder what happened
  Am            C/G
Betwixt and between
     F          G             C         G
When I went to work in tall buildings
 
[Chorus]
    C                     G6
And it's goodbye to the sunshine
   Am            C7
Goodbye to the dew
    F             G
Goodbye to the flowers
      C         G
And goodbye to you
    C            G6
I'm off to the subway
    Am         C/G
I must not be late
 F        G              C       G
Going to work in tall buildings
