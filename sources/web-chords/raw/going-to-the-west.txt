[Verse 1]
E
In this fair land you'll stay no more
      B          E
Here labor is in vain
                  B                A
You'll leave the mountains of our birth
                       E
And seek the fertile plain
        B            E
You're going to the west
 
 
[Chorus]
E
You say you will not go with me
    B               E
You turn your eyes away
            B               A
You say you will not follow me
                  E
No matter what I say
    B             E
I'm going to the west
 
 
[Verse 2]
E
Years have passed since we first met
     B               E
When you became my bride
            B           A
Now I must journey far away
                   E
Without you by my side
     B            E
I'm going to the west
 
 
[Chorus]
E
You say you will not go with me
    B               E
You turn your eyes away
            B               A
You say you will not follow me
                  E
No matter what I say
    B             E
I'm going to the west
 
 
[Verse 3]
E
You'll leave me here in this land I love
        B                    E
Midst scenes so bright and fair
       B                A
Where fragrant flowers bloom
                     E
And music fills the air
        B            E
You're going to the west
 
 
[Chorus]
E
You say you will not go with me
    B               E
You turn your eyes away
            B               A
You say you will not follow me
                  E
No matter what I say
    B             E
I'm going to the west
    B             E
I'm going to the west
