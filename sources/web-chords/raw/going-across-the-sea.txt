Weezer - Across the Sea
 
Tabbed by: Pbill
 
I play the D/F# like this: 20023x
 
Tune down a half step to match the album recording.
 
[Verse 1]
 
G   Bm  Em D        G        Bm      C       D       G
You are 18 year old girl who live in small city in Japan.
    Bm    Em         D
You heard me on the radio.
 G        Bm     C          D         G
About one year ago and you wanted to know,
     Bm       Em     D
all about me and my hobbies.
G      Bm       Em         D
   My favorite food and my birthday
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G          Bm          Em       D
Why are you so far away from me?
G          Bm                  Em        D
I need help and you're way across the sea
C                G           Am
I could never touch you - I think it would be wrong
     G    D/F#     Em     D
Oh - I've got your letter
C      D       G
you've got my song
 
 
[Break 1]
 
| Em D | C Bm | Am  | Am D |
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
G          Bm   Em     D        G
They don't make stationery like this
          Bm        C
where I'm from - so fragile,
D     G
so refined
     Bm    Em    D
So I sniff and I lick
G        Bm       C              D            G
your envelope and fall to little pieces every time
  Bm          Em          D       G
I wonder what clothes you wear to school
  Bm             C        D    G
I wonder how you decorate your room
  Bm             Em        D
I wonder how you touch yourself
    G       Bm        C      D        G
and curse myself for being across the sea
 
 
[Chorus]
 
G       Bm          Em       D
Why are you so far away from me?
G       Bm                  Em        D
I need help and you're way across the sea
C             G           Am
I could never touch you - I think it would be wrong
G    D/F#     Em     D
I've got your letter
C      D      G
you've got my song
 
 
[Break 2]

Gm  Dm  Gm  Dm  Cm

[Verse 3]
 
E  Emaj7 C#m7     G#m7      A            Amaj7
At 10 I shaved my head and tried to be a monk
E  Emaj7      C#m7   G#7         A           Amaj7
I thought the older women would like me if i did
E  Emaj7 C#m        B          A                B
You see mom, I'm a good little boy (good little boy)
E    Emaj7    C#m    B
It's all your fault, momma.
A    G#m      F#m     B
It's all your fault
 
 
[Verse 4]
 
G   Bm        Em          D      G
Goddamn, this business is really lame
        Bm         C         D        G
I gotta live on an island to find the juice
       Bm   Em      D
So you send me your love
     G              Bm
from all around the world
        C       D     G         Bm           C       D
As if I could live on words and dreams and a million screams
    G     Bm     C       D       G
oh, how I need a hand in mine to feel.
 
 
[Bridge]
 
G       Bm         Am        E     D
Why are you so far away from me?
G       Bm         Am        E
Why are you so far away from me?
 
 
[Outro]
 
C             G           Am
I could never touch you - I think it would be wrong
G    D/F#     Em      D
I've got your letter
C      D      G
you've got my song
G    D/F#     Em      D
I've got your letter
C      D      G
you've got my song
