Black eyed Susie went to town
C                   G
All she wore was a gingham gown
 
C                 F
I may get drunk I may get woozy
C                   G
But I’m comin’ home to Black eyed Susie
 
C                 F
Black eyed Susie’s long and tall
C                   G
Sleeps in the kitchen with her feet in the hall
 
C                 F
Hey old man I want your daughter
C                   G
To chop my wood and carry my water
 
C                 F
Black eyed Susie lives in a holler
C                   G
She won’t come and I won’t call her
 
C                 F
All I want in this creation
C                   G
Pretty little wife on a big plantation.
 
C                 F
All I need to make me happy

Two little boys to call me Pappy

C                 F
Black eyed Susie went huckleberry pickin’
C                   G
Came home late and took a lickin’
 
C                 F
Black-Eyed Susie’s long and lean,
C                   G
Prettiest girl I ever seen.
 
C                 F
Some got drunk and some got boozy
C                   G
But I made love to black-eyed Susie
 
C                 F
I'm walking drunk across the water
C                   G
Some old man's gonna' lose his daughter.
 
C                 F
I got me a gal ahead of the hill,
C                   G
If she won't do it her sister will.
 
C                 F
I got me a gal in Witchita,
C                   G
She's got four kids they call me pa.
 
C                 F
I got me a gal in Baton Rouge,
C                   G
She's got ten kids, The Lord knows who's.
