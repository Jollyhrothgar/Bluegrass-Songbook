[Intro]
G  D7  G
 
 
[Chorus]
          G
I've been gathering flowers from the hillside
                      D7
To wreath around your brow
           G
But you've kept me a-waiting so long, dear
                 D7           G
The flowers have all withered now
 
 
[Verse 1]
       G
It was on one bright June morning
                  D7
The roses were in bloom
  G
I shot and killed my darling
              D7    G     G7
And what will be my doom?
 
 
[Chorus]
          C
I've been gathering flowers from the hillside
                      G7
To wreath around your brow
           C
But you've kept me a-waiting so long, dear
                 G7           C
The flowers have all withered now
 
 
[Interlude]
C
       G7
C
   G7  C
 
 
[Verse 2]
  C
I know that you have seen trouble
                         G7
But never hang down your head
     C
Your love for me is like the flowers
              G7    C
Your love for me is dead
 
 
[Chorus]
          C
I've been gathering flowers from the hillside
                      G7
To wreath around your brow
           C
But you've kept me a-waiting so long, dear
                 G7           C   C7
The flowers have all withered now
 
 
[Verse 3]
       F
Closed eyes cannot see these roses
                                 C7
Closed hands cannot hold them, I know
       F
Closed lips cannot kiss, my darling
                 C7        F
You're gone from me forevermore
 
 
[Chorus]
          F
I've been gathering flowers from the hillside
                      C7
To wreath around your brow
           F
But you've kept me a-waiting so long, dear
                 C7           F
The flowers have all withered now
 
 
[Outro]
F  C7  F
