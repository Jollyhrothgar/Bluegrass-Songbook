I know that this isn't perfect, but it's pretty close.
 
    C             Am            Dm           G7
The ash grove how graceful, how plainly 'tis speaking
    C                F           G7           C
The harp through its playing has language for me.
     C        Am                Dm          G7
When-ever the light through its branches is breaking,
  C            F        G         C
A host of kind faces is gazing on me.
    C               Dm        G           C
The friends from my childhood again are before me
     Am            Dm        G    D7  G
Each step wakes a memory as freely I roam.
     C             Am        Dm            G7
With soft whispers laden the leaves rustle o’er me
    C              F         G7          C
The ash grove, the ash grove alone is my home.
 
     C            Am            Dm           G7
Down yonder green valley where streamlets meander
     C           F        G7        C
When twilight is fading I pensively rove
   C             Am           Dm       G7
Or at the bright noon tide in solitude wander
  C            F             G         C
Amid the dark shades of the lonely ash grove.
      C               Dm             G          C
'Twas there while the black bird was cheerfully singing
  Am             Dm           G      D7  G
I first met that dear one the joy of my heart
 C             Am          Dm              G7
Around us for gladness the blue bells were ringing
    C           F             G7             C
But then little thought I how soon we should part.
 
   C         Am            Dm          G7
My lips smile no more, my heart loses lightness;
    C           F         G7         C
No dream of the future my spirit can cheer.
  C        Am           Dm           G7
I only can brood on the past and its brightness
    C           F         G           C
The dear ones I long for again gather here.
      C         Dm              G          C
From ev'ry dark nook they press forward to meet me;
  Am         Dm          G      D7   G
I lift up my eyes to the broad leafy dome,
    C          Am             Dm          G7
And others are there, looking downward to greet me
    C              F          G7          C
The ash grove, the ash grove, again is my home.
