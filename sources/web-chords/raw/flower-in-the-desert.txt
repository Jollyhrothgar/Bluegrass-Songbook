[Intro]
 
Dm Dmb6 Dm6 Dmb6
Dm Dmb6 Dm6 Dmb6
 
Am Amb6 Am6 Amb6
 
 
[Verse]
 
Am
Wait a minute my friend
Am
Don't pass me up for dead
   Amb6
As Babylon crumbles to sand
        Am
A sweet flower blossoms in my hand
Am             Amb6       Am6 Amb6
Another day is ending for you
        Am Amb6 Am6 Amb6
Another day
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Am         F              Em
I am alive, see my rivers flowing
        G             Am                 F
I don't wanna be like , I don't wanna be like you
Em                     G
There are no others in here, no
 
 
 
[Interlude]
 
Am
 
 
[Bridge]
 
Am
And a voice of the people cries
Am
As it drones on in monotone
Am
Here is the news it's all so sad
Am
Ooh and the black and white
Am
The diluted truth of you
Am
Put the pennies in a collection plate
Am
Come on come on come on
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
Am               Amb6
Wait a minute my friend
Am6                  Amb6
Don't pass me up for dead
   Am                  Amb6
As Babylon crumbles to sand
      Am6              Amb6
A sweet flower blossoms in my hand
Am             Amb6       Am6 Amb6
Another day is ending for you
        Am Amb6 Am6 Amb6
Another day
 
 
[Chorus 2]
 
Am        F              Em
I am alive see my rivers burning
              G
We're burning up in here
Am                     F
There are no others in here, no
Em                     G
There are no others in here, no
Am                  F    Em G
We're burning up in here
   Am F   Em G
Oh no, Oh no
 
 
[Coda]
 
Dm
Step a little closer
Dmb6
I wonder if you can
Dm6                     Dmb6 Dm
Remember me in this way
