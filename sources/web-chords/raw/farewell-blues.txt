Mama said, “Don’t give your love to a highway man”

Going drifting like a ship out on the sea

I’m going drifting like a ship out on the sea
G                       D
Like a ship out on the sea
        F#              Bm      G
Goin’ far’s the eye can see
D       A                       G
Yeah going drifting like a ship out on the sea
