[Verse 1]
G            C
When I was a little bitty boy
G               D
Just up off the floor,
G                     C
We used to go down to Grandma's house
G           D      G
Every month end or so
          G               C
We'd have chicken pie and country ham 'n'
G                      D
Homemade butter on the bread
        G                     C
But the best darn thing about Grandma's house
      D                 G
Was a great big feather bed
 
[Chorus]
       G
It was nine feet high and six feet wide
C               G
Soft as a downy chick
       G
It was made from the feathers of forty 'leven geese
       A7                          D
Took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick
     G
It'd hold eight kids 'n' four hound dogs
        C                       G
And the piggy we stole from the shed (oink, oink!)
          G                     C
We didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun
   D                 G
On Grandma's feather bed
 
[Verse 2]
G                 C
After supper we'd sit around the fire
G               D
The old folks'd spit and chew
G                   C
Pa would talk about the farm in the war
G                   D         G
And granny'd sing a ballad or two
    G                  C
I'd sit and listen and watch the fire
G                D
Till the cobwebs filled my head
     G                  C
Next thing I'd know I'd wake up in the mornin'
       D                 G
In the middle of the old feather bed
 
[Chorus]
       G
It was nine feet high and six feet wide
C               G
Soft as a downy chick
       G
It was made from the feathers of forty 'leven geese
       A7                          D
Took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick
     G
It'd hold eight kids, four hound dogs
        C                       G
And the piggy we stole from the shed (oink, oink!)
          G                     C
We didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun
   D                 G
On Grandma's feather bed
 
[Verse 3]
G                 C
Well, I love my ma, I love my pa
G               D
I love granny and granpa too
G                   C
I been fishing with my uncle, I wrestled with my cousin
G                   D         G
I even kissed Aunt Lou, eww!
    G                  C
But if I ever had to make a choice
G                D
I guess it oughta be said
     G                  C
That I'd trade 'em all plus the gal down the road
       D                 G
For Grandma's feather bed
G                 C
I'd trade 'em all plus the gal down the road
(Well, maybe not the gal down the road)
 
[Chorus]
       G
It was nine feet high and six feet wide
C               G
Soft as a downy chick
       G
It was made from the feathers of forty 'leven geese
       A7                          D
Took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick
         G
And it'd hold eight kids, four hound dogs
        C                       G
And the piggy we stole from the shed (oink, oink!)
          G                     C
We didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun
   D                 G
On Grandma's feather bed
          G                     C
We didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun
   D                 G
On Grandma's feather bed
