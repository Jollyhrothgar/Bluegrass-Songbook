Title: Dooley
Artist: The Dillards
Album: Black Porch Bluegrass
 
 
[Verse]
G            C
Dooley was a good ole man
   G               D
He lived below the mill
G              C
Dooley had two daughters
      G     D      G
And a forty-gallon still
 
 
[Verse]
G                   C
One gal watched the boiler
    G                 D
The other watched the spout
    G               C
And mama corked the bottles
        G      D           G
And ole Dooley fetched 'em out
 
 
[Chorus]
G
Dooley slippin' up the holler
C
Dooley try to make a dollar
G
 Dooley give me a swaller
         D                G
And I'll pay you back someday
 
 
[Verse]
    G         C
The revenuers came for him
  G                  D
A-sippin' though the woods
G             C
Dooley kept behind them all
    G     D        G
And never lost his goods
 
 
[Verse]
G            C
Dooley was a trader
     G              D
When into town he'd come
G            C
Sugar by the bushel
      G      D      G
And molasses by the ton
 
 
[Chorus]
G
Dooley slippin' up the holler
C
Dooley try to make a dollar
G
 Dooley give me a swaller
         D                G
And I'll pay you back someday
 
 
[Verse]
G          C
I remember very well
    G              D
The day ole Dooley died
    G                  C
The women folk weren't sorry
        G         D         G
And the men stood round and cried
 
 
[Verse]
    G              C
Now Dooleys on the mountain
   G               D
He lies there all alone
     G           C
They put a jug beside him
      G      D       G
And a barrel for his stone
 
 
[Chorus]
G
Dooley slippin' up the holler
C
Dooley try to make a dollar
G
 Dooley give me a swaller
         D                G
And I'll pay you back someday
