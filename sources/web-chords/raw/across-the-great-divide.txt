Across The Great Divide
Kate Wolf
Close to You
1981
 
Capo I
 
[Intro]
 
G  C  G
G   G G/F# Em   C
G   G G/F# Em   C  D  G
 
[Verse 1]
G                 C     G
I've been walking in my sleep
G   G/F#  Em                           C
Counting  troubles instead of counting sheep
G                     G G/F#  Em
Where the years went, I can't say
       C             D                 G
I just turned around  and they've gone away
 
[Verse 2]
G                     C           G
And I've been sifting through the layers
   G  G/F#  Em                C
Of dusty    books and faded papers
G                   G    G/F#  Em
They tell a story I used to    know
                    C        D         G
And it was one that happened   so long ago
 
[Chorus 1]
(G)       G    C        G
It's gone away in yesterday
G   G/F#  Em                         C
And I     find myself on the mountainside
          G      G/F#   Em
Where the rivers change direction
C          D     G
Across the great divide
 
[Verse 3]
      G         C   G
Now I heard the owl calling
G   G/F# Em               C
Softly   as the night was falling
       G             G G/F# Em
With a question, and I replied
         C    D                G
But he's gone across the borderline
 
[Chorus 2]
(G)       G    C        G
It's gone away in yesterday
G   G/F#  Em                         C
And I     find myself on the mountainside
          G      G/F#   Em
Where the rivers change direction
C          D     G
Across the great divide
 
[solo] (verse)
 
[Verse 4]
(G)        G         C      G
The finest hour that I have seen
G  G/F# Em             C
Is the  one that comes between
            G             G     G/F# Em
The edge of night and the break of   day
              C        D       G
It's when the darkness   rolls away
 
[Chorus/Outro]
(G)       G    C        G
It's gone away in yesterday
G   G/F#  Em                         C
And I     find myself on the mountainside
          G      G/F#   Em
Where the rivers change direction
C          D     G
Across the great divide
 
(G)       G    C        G
It's gone away in yesterday
G   G/F#  Em                         C
And I     find myself on the mountainside
          G      G/F#   Em
Where the rivers change direction
C          D     G
Across the great divide...
