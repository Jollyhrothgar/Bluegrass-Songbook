[Verse 1]
   G               C
My wife and I live all alone,
      D7                  G
In a little brown hut we call our own.
G                 C
She loves gin and I love rum,
D7                 G
Tell you now don't we have fun?
 
[Chorus]
G           C
Ha! Ha! Ha! You and me,
D7                     G
Little brown jug don't I love thee!
G           C
Ha! Ha! Ha! You and me,
D7                     G
Little Brown jug don't I love thee!
 
[Verse 2]
     G            C
When I go toiling on my farm,
D7                   G
Little brown jug is under my arm
G                    C
Set her 'neath some shady tree,
D7                     G
Little brown jug don't I love thee!
 
[Chorus]
G           C
Ha! Ha! Ha! You and me,
D7                     G
Little brown jug don't I love thee!
G           C
Ha! Ha! Ha! You and me,
D7                     G
Little Brown jug don't I love thee!
 
[Verse 3]
     G               C
The rose is red, my nose is too,
     D7                G
The violet's blue and so are you.
G               C
And I guess before I stop,
  D7             G
I better take another drop!
 
[Chorus]
G           C
Ha! Ha! Ha! You and me,
D7                     G
Little brown jug don't I love thee!
G           C
Ha! Ha! Ha! You and me,
D7                     G
Little Brown jug don't I love thee!
