[Intro]

[Verse]
C
 The steel guitar played when I met her and it played the night I lost her
        G7                                            C
Yes you drove her to another with your sweet Hawaiian charms
C
I know your sorry but it's too late now and I know you meant no harm
        G7                                               C
But the waltz that you were playin' put her in another's arms
 
[Chorus]
G            D7                                         G
Cry steel guitar cry on, you're crying because you know she is gone
            G7        C                 D7                   G   G7
Gone with another and I'm all alone, so cry steel guitar cry on
 
[Interlude]

[Chorus]
 G            D7                                         G
(Cry steel guitar cry on, you're crying because you know she is gone)
            G7        C                 D7                   G   G7
Gone with another and I'm all alone, so cry steel guitar cry on
