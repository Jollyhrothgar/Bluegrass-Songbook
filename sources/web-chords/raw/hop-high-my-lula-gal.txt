G
Well where did you get them high top shoes?
G                       D       G
And that dress that you wear so fine?
G
I got my shoes from a railroading man
G                      D             G
And my dress is from a driver in the mine

Hop high, my lulu gal

Well, where have you been my lulu girl?
G              D       G
Where have you been so long?
G
Well, I've been in the pen with the rough and rowdy men
G             D          G
And honey I'm goin' back again

Well, I'll pawn you my watch and I'll pawn you my chain
G                     D       G
I'll pawn you my gold wedding ring
G
To pay my little lulu girl's fine
G                D            G
I'll pawn you my wagon and my team
