[Verse 1]
 
G
We were waltzing one night in Kentucky
                            D7   D
Neath the beautiful harvest moon
    D7      D           D7    D
And I was a boy who was lucky
       D7  D         G
But it all ended too soon
 
 
As I sit here alone in the moonlight
                G7      C
I can see your smilin' face
                          G        E7
And I long once more for your embrace
        A7           D7    G     G
In the beautiful  Kentucky waltz

[Verse 2]
*original verse 2 lyrics by Kim Hartshorn*
 
G
The band was playing our favorite number
                               D7   D
The couples were crowding the floor
    D7       D         D7     D
But I didn't feel like dancing
             D7        D       G
Without the girl I was pinin' for
 
 
But suddenly out in the moonlight
                     G7      C
There appeared your smilin' face
                              G        E7
And we danced once more in a sweet embrace
        A7          D7    G     G
To the beautiful Kentucky Waltz
