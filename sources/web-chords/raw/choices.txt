[Chorus]
 
         D                  G              D
I've had choices, since the day that I was born.
           D            Em                 A
There were voices, that told me right from wrong.
         D              G
If I had listened, no I wouldn't be here today.
D                          A            D
Living and dying, with the choices I've made.
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
      A              G           D
I was tempted, by an early age I found.
       A                  G               D
I like drinkin', oh and I never turned it down.
           D                 G
There were loved ones, but I turned them all away.
        D                          A            D
Now I'm living and dying, with the choices I've made.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
         D                  G              D
I've had choices, since the day that I was born.
           D            Em                 A
There were voices, that told me right from wrong.
         D              G
If I had listened, no I wouldn't be here today.
D                          A            D
Living and dying, with the choices I've made.
 
 
[Interlude]
 
(D) D  G  G
 D  D  A  D  D
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
            A               G                   D
I guess I'm paying, for the things that I have done.
           A           G              D
If I could go back, oh Lord knows I'd run.
              D            G
But I'm still losin', this game of life I play.
D                          A            D
Losing and dying, with the choices I've made.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
         D                  G              D
I've had choices, since the day that I was born.
           D            Em                 A
There were voices, that told me right from wrong.
         D           G
If I had listened, I wouldn't be here today.
D                          A            D
Living and dying, with the choices I've made.

D
Living and dying with the
A                     D
  choices I've made
