[Intro]
G  D  G  C  G  D  G
 
[Verse 1]
     G        D         G       C
I've traveled o'er this country wide
G       D       G
Seekin' fortune fair
G      D        G         C
Up and down the two coast lines
     G             D
I've traveled everywhere
     C                 G
From Portland East and Portland West
    G              D
And back along the line
      G     D          G            C
I'm a-goin' now to the place that's best
     G        D       G
That old home town of mine
 
[Chorus]
G
Eight more miles and Louisville
     C             G
Will come in to my view
G
Eight more miles on this old road
         A7            D
And I'll never more be blue
  C                  G
I knew some day that I'd come back
  G                D
I knew it from the start
G          D        G    C
Eight more miles to Louisville
    G         D     G
The home town of my heart

[Verse 2]
        G        D    G        C
There's bound to be a girl somewhere
     G        D       G
That you like best of all
G          D       G    C
Mine lives down in Louisville
      G               D
She's long and she is tall
    C                   G
But she's the kind that you can't find
  G                    D
A-rambling through the land
    G     D        G    C
I'm on my way this very day
   G       D         G
To win her heart and hand
 
[Chorus]
    G
Oh, eight more miles and Louisville
     C             G
Will come in to my view
G
Eight more miles on this old road
         A7            D
And I'll never more be blue
  C                  G
I knew some day that I'd come back
  G                D
I knew it from the start
G          D        G    C
Eight more miles to Louisville
    G         D     G
The home town of my heart

[Verse 3]
      G     D       G     C
Well, I can picture in my mind
  G           D        G
A place we'll call our home
  G      D      G       C
A humble little hut for two
      G             D
We'll never want to roam
        C                      G
Now the place that's right for that love site
   G                 D
Is in them bluegrass hills
      G      D         G  C
Where gently flows the Ohio
     G         D       G
By a place called Louisville
 
[Chorus]
    G
Oh, eight more miles and Louisville
     C             G
Will come in to my view
G
Eight more miles on this old road
         A7            D
And I'll never more be blue
  C                  G
I knew some day that I'd come back
  G                D
I knew it from the start
G          D        G    C
Eight more miles to Louisville
    G         D     G  C  G  C  G  C  G
The home town of my heart
