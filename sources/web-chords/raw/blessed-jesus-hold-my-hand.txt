Song: Jesus Hold My Hand
Album: 40 Years of the Voice
 
[Intro]
 
G D A D
 
[Verse 1]
 
                         D
As I travel through this pilgrim land
            G                       D
There is a  friend, who walks with  me
D
Leads me safely through the sinking sand
          A
It is the Christ of Calva-ry
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
D
This would be my prayer dear Lord each day
           G             D
To help me do the best I can
           G            D
For I need the light to guide me day and night
               A        D
Blessed Jesus  hold my  hand
 
[Chorus]
 
            D                G           D
Jesus, hold my hand, I need, thee every  hour
                               A
Through, this pilgrim land, pro-tect me by Thy  power
D                    G                 D
Hear my feeble plea, O-Lord, look down on me
        G                 D
When I  kneel in prayer I hope to meet you there
        A          D
Blessed Jesus  hold my  hand
 
[Instrumental]
 
G D G
 
[Verse 3]
 
D
Let me travel in the light divine
            G                D
That I may  see, the blessed way
D
Keep me that I may be wholly Thine
            A
And sing re-demption's  song some  day
 
 
[Verse 4]
 
D
I will be a soldier brave and true
          G              D
And ever  firmly take a  stand
     G              D
As I onward go and  daily meet the foe
        A     D
Blessed Jesus  hold my  hand
 
[Chorus]
 
D                      G                 D
Jesus, hold my hand, I need, thee every  hour
D                               A
Through, this pilgrim land, pro-tect me by Thy  power
D                    G                 D
Hear my feeble plea, O-Lord, look down on me
        G                 D
When I  kneel in prayer I hope to meet you there
D              A
Blessed Jesus  hold my  hand
 
[Outro]
 
       G                  D
When I kneel in prayer I  hope to meet you there
D
Blessed Jesus hold my  hand
