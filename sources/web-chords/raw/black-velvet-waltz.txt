Em
(with blues fills, 8 bars)
Mmmmm     mmmm    oooooo  (ad lib)
 
 
[Verse 1]
Em
Mississippi in the middle of a dry spell
Em
Jimmy Rogers on the Victrola up high
Em
Mama's dancing - baby on her shoulder
Em
The sun is setting like molasses in the sky
Bsus4         B                 Asus4   A
The boy could sing, knew how to move  -  everything
Gsus4     G           Dsus4            D
   Always wanting more - it leaves you longing for
 
 
[Chorus]
Am                    D
Black Velvet in that little boy's smile
Am                      F            C
Black Velvet with that slow southern style
Am                     D
A new religion that'll bring you to your knees
C7     B7                 Em
Black Velvet   -   if you please
 
 
[Verse 2]
Em
Up in Memphis the music's like a heatwave
Em
White lightning, bound to drive you wild
Em
Mama's baby's in the heart of every school girl
Em
"Love Me Tender" leaves 'em cryin' in the aisles
Bsus4       B               Asus4    A
 The way he moved, it was a sin, so sweet and true
Gsus4     G        Dsus4            D
Always wanting more, he'd leave you longing for
 
 
[Chorus]
Am                    D
Black Velvet in that little boy's smile
Am                      F            C
Black Velvet with that slow southern style
Am                     D
A new religion that'll bring you to your knees
C7     B7                 Em
Black Velvet   -   if you please
 
 
[Bridge]
A                   B                         Em
Every word of every song that he sang is for you
A                  F                   C7      N.C.      B7          Em
In a flash he was gone  -  it happened so soon    -    what could you do?

Black Velvet with that slow southern style
Am                     D
A new religion that'll bring you to your knees
C7     B7                 Em
Black Velvet   -   if you please
