Song is perfomed differently in each recording I've heard, string together A and B sections to match
the version you prefer. Intro transcribed from the Transatlantic Sessions recording.
Chords are listed once per measure of 2/2 played, as there are no lyrics to keep time.
 
Tuning: CGCFCe
 
For A and G#m7 fret 5th and 6th string with thumb
For G#m7 also mute 4th string with thumb
For B5 mute 6th string with thumb, can do the same for A/E if you like that sound better
 
Chord shapes relative to capo on 4th:
 
A/E:  020001
E5:   000203
E:    000200
A:    550005
G#m7: 44x223
