[Intro]
D
 
 
[Chorus]
                  A                D
The green rolling hills of West Virginia
        G                              A
Are the nearest place to Heaven that I know
           D
Though the times are sad and drear
      G
And I cannot linger here
          D           A            D
They will keep me and never let me go.
 
 
[Verse 1]
                        A         D
My Daddy said don’t you ever be a miner
  G                                A
A miner’s grave is all you’ll ever own
      D
Never have a dime to spare
G
Hard times everywhere
      D                  A               D
These times they are the worst I’ve ever known.
 
 
[Chorus]
                     A                D
But he green rolling hills of West Virginia
        G                              A
Are the nearest place to Heaven that I know
           D
Though the times are sad and drear
      G
And I cannot linger here
          D           A            D
They will keep me and never let me go.
 
 
[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
                 A               D
I’ll move away into some crowded city
   G                                    A
In northern fact’ry town you’ll find me there
            D
Though I’ll leave my heart behind
     G
I’ll never change my mind
         D                A               D
For this troubled life is more than I can bear
 
 
[Chorus]
                     A                D
But he green rolling hills of West Virginia
        G                              A
Are the nearest place to Heaven that I know
           D
Though the times are sad and drear
      G
And I cannot linger here
          D           A            D
They will keep me and never let me go.
 
 
[Outro]
