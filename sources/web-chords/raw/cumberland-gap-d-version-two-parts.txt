[Verse]
Dm             F
Kiss me mama, kiss your boy
Dm                C
Bless me well and lucky
      Dm                 F
For I won't be back 'til I return
     C
I'm going to old Kentucky

Cumberland Gap, is the devil of a gap
Dm                         C
That's what the scouts all tell ya

Sure enough it'll make it tough

If it doesn't kill ya, kill ya

  Kentucky she's a waitin' on the other side

Put the daylight in your eye

He made the trip in the blizzard's grip
     C
I'd rather wrestle Satan

Oh, the snow kept coming
Dm              F
Picked her up upon his back

My god he loved that woman

Daniel stood on the pinnacle rock
        Dm               C
Looking up and down the mountain
Dm              F
Took his trusty old flintlock
C
Daniel started shouting, shouting

Give you the fever

Put the daylight in your eye

Cumberland Gap, is the devil of a gap
Dm                      F
Cumberland Gap, is the devil of a gap
