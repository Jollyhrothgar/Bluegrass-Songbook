Capo on 2nd fret
 
[Intro]
A    D    A
A    E7   A
 
 
[Verse 1]
          A          D               A
There's a fairground down in Chattanooga
        A                                E7
Where a kiddy train runs up and down the track
           A                    D
There's an old black hound that always hangs around
       A           E7             A
And he chases that train down and back
 
 
[Chorus]
             D                     A
And I've been chasing you like that Chattanooga dog
E7                              A
   Even though I know you don't care
         D                     A
I've been chasing you like that Chattanooga dog
       D            E7         A
And it ain't gonna get me anywhere
 
 
[Interlude]
A    D    A
A    E7   A
 
 
[Verse 2]
          A             D                A
Well, I'm thinking that you're like that old train
   A                     E7
Anybody gets a ticket to ride
        A                      D
And I'm like that pup, I won't ever give up
       A           E7         A
I'd do anything to be by your side
 
 
[Chorus]
             D                     A
And I've been chasing you like that Chattanooga dog
E7                              A
   Even though I know you don't care
         D                     A
I've been chasing you like that Chattanooga dog
       D            E7         A
And it ain't gonna get me anywhere
 
 
[Interlude]
A    D    A
A    E7   A
 
 
[Verse 3]
      A            D             A
Every day when the kids come for playing
   A                              E7
To ride that ol' kiddy train once more
             A                           D
There's that old faithful hound with his tongue hanging down
    A                E7       A
And running 'til his feet get sore
 
 
[Chorus]
             D                     A
And I've been chasing you like that Chattanooga dog
E7                              A
   Even though I know you don't care
         D                     A
I've been chasing you like that Chattanooga dog
       D            E7         A
And it ain't gonna get me anywhere
