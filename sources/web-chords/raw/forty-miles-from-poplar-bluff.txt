Here's one that Porter and Dolly got a lot of "Miles" out of. This is the 
work of Tim Ausburn.

FORTY MILES FROM POPLAR BLUFF   Writers, Frank Dycus and Larry Kingston

Key of G


(G) I NEVER HAD A PAIR OF SHOES, THAT WERN'T OLD HAND ME (C) DOWNS,

AND DADDY'S MORNIN' (G) COFFEE, CAME FROM OLD LEFT OVER (D7)GROUNDS,

MY (G) MAMA WORE NO JEWELRY, OR ANY STORE BOUGHT (C) STUFF,

'CAUSE HOME WAS JUST A (D7) HILLSIDE, FORTY MILES FROM POPLAR (G) BLUFF.



* * *  CHORUS  * * *

FORTY (D7) MILES BACK IN MISSOURI,

THERE'S A (C) DIFFERENT WAY OF (G) LIFE,


    hide ad ⨯
    
        
    



WHERE A (D7) MAN THINKS OF HIS NEIGHBOR,

AND (C) NOT HIS NEIGHBOR'S (D7) WIFE,

(G) LIFE IS FAR FROM FANCY, SOMETIMES KINDA (C) ROUGH,

BUT CONTENTMENT MAKES IT (G) WORTH IT,

FORTY (D7) MILES FROM POPLAR (G) BLUFF.




OUR ONLY FAMILY TREASURE, WAS A BEAT UP RADIO,

AND IT TOOK US TO THE PLACES, WHERE WE KNEW WE'D NEVER GO,

WE NEVER HAD MUCH MONEY, BUT WE ALWAYS HAD ENOUGH,

'CAUSE MONEY NEVER MATTERED, FORTY MILES FROM POPLAR BLUFF.


* * *  REPEAT CHORUS  * * *



WELL, NEARLY EVERY WINTER, WHEN THE SNOW WAS ON THE GROUND,

THE ROADS WOULD ALL BE CLOSED, AND WE COULDN'T GET TO TOWN,

BUT IF DADDY HAD HIS TERBACKER, AND GRANDMA HAD HER SNUFF,

THEN THE WINTERS DIDN'T MATTER, FORTY MILES FROM POPLAR BLUFF.


* * *  REPEAT CHORUS  * * *
