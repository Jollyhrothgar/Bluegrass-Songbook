Chords transcribed by John Kean (keanj@agresearch.cri.nz)
 
Capo 1st fret
 
 
[Intro]
| C     | Am  F  | G  | C     |
 
[Verse 1]
C                     Am
Yesterday you came to lift me up
   F                                  C
As light as straw and brittle as a bird
  Dm                      Am
Today I weigh less than a shadow on the wall
              G            G     Am7   G/B
Just one more whisper of a voice unheard
 
[Verse 2]
C                  Am
Tomorrow leave the windows open
   F                                  C
As fear grows please hold me in your arms
  Dm                            Am
Won't you help me if you can to shake this anger?
              G    G         Am7       G/B
I need your gentle hands to keep me calm
 
[Chorus]
         C
'Cause I never thought I'd lose
  G/B
I only thought I'd win
  Am
I never dreamed I'd feel
     Em/G
This fire beneath my skin
                    F
I can't believe you love me
                      C     Am
I never thought you'd come
                    C/G
I guess I misjudged love
          F/G    C/G  G    C
Between a father and his son
 
[Interlude]
|(C)    | Am  F  | G  |
 
[Verse 3]
C                     Am
Things we never said come together
   F                                 C
The hidden truth no longer haunting me
  Dm                                       Am
Tonight we touched on the things that were never spoken
     G       G             Am7        G/B
That kind of understanding sets me free
 
[Chorus]
         C
'Cause I never thought I'd lose
  G/B
I only thought I'd win
  Am
I never dreamed I'd feel
     Em/G
This fire beneath my skin
                    F
I can't believe you love me
                      C     Am
I never thought you'd come
                    C/G
I guess I misjudged love
          F/G    C/G  G  C
Between a father and his son
