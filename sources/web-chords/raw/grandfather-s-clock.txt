[Verse 1]
   D             A              D             G
My grandfather's clock, was too large for the shelf
      D            A            D
So it stood ninety years on the floor
       D         A                  D          G
It was taller by half, than the the old man himself
          D             A           D
Though it weighed not a pennyweight more
       D                          G               D
It was bought on the morn, of the day that he was born
        D                       A
And was always his treasure and pride
A7     D         A       D            G
But it stopped - short - never to go again
         D     A     D
When the old - man - died
 
[Bridge]
       D
Ninety years without slumbering... his life seconds numbering...
   D         A       D            G
It stopped - short - never to go again
         D     A     D
When the old - man - died
 
[Verse 2]
   D           A            D              G
My grandfather said that of those he could hire
      D          A           D
Not a servant so faithful he found
       D         A        D             G
For it wasted no time and had but one desire
       D             A          D
At the close of each week to be wound
       D                        G              D
And it kept in its place, not a frown upon its face
        D                       A
And its hands never hung by its side
A7     D         A       D            G
But it stopped - short - never to go again
         D     A     D     E
When the old - man - died
 
[Verse 3]
   E         B7             E           A
It rang and alarmed, in the dead of the night
    E             B7             E
An alarm that for years had been dumb
       E             B7         E           A
And we knew that his spirit was pluming for flight
         E          B7          E
That his hour for departure had come
          E                           A                E
Still the clock kept the time, with a soft and muffled chime
      E                     B7
As we silently stood by his side
B7     E         B7      E            A
But it stopped - short - never to go again
         E     B7    E
When the old - man - died
 
[Bridge]
       E
Ninety years without slumbering... his life seconds numbering...
   E         B7      E            A
It stopped - short - never to go again
         E     B7    E
When the old - man - died
