Grandma got run over by a reindeer
                                       A
walking home from our house Christmas Eve
                                      E
You can say there’s no such thing as santa
    B                              E      D A E
but as for me and grandpa we believe
 
 
[Verse]
N.C.                         B
She'd been drinking too much eggnog
                         E
and we begged her not to go
          E7            A
but she forgot her medication
        B                                  E
and she staggered out the door into the snow
C#m                           G#m
 When we found her Christmas morning
B7                         E
 at the scene of the attack
E7                           A
 she had hoof prints on her forehead
      B                              E
and incriminating Claus marks on her back
 
 
[Chorus]
  E
Grandma got run over by a reindeer
                                      A
walking home from our house Christmas Eve
                                  E
You can say there’s no such thing as santa
    B                              E      D A E
but as for me and grandpa we believe
 
 
[Verse]
N.C.                     B
Now were all so proud of grandpa
                         E
he's been taking this so well
        E7               A
see him in there watching football
       B                                   E
drinking beer and playing cards with cousin mel
 C#m                           G#m
   It's not Christmas without grandma
B7                         E
  all the family’s dressed in black
E7                           A
  and we just cant help but wonder
          B                             E
should we open up her gifts or send them back!
 
 
[Chorus]
E
Grandma got run over by a reindeer
                                      A
walking home from our house Christmas Eve
                                      E
You can say there’s no such thing as santa
 B                              E      D A E
but as for me and grandpa we believe
 
 
[Verse]
N.C.                    B
Now the goose is on the table
                         E
and the pudding made of fig
          E7            A
and the blue and silver candles
            B                                     E
that would just have matched the hair in grandmas wig
C#m                           G#m
   I've warned all my friends and neighbors
B7                         E
  better watch out for yourselves
E7                         A
  they should never give a license
     B                                      E
to a man who drives a sleigh and plays with elves!
 
 
[Chorus]
  E
Grandma got run over by a reindeer
                                      A
walking home from our house Christmas Eve
                                      E
You can say there’s no such thing as santa
    B                              E    C#
but as for me and grandpa we believe
 
F#
