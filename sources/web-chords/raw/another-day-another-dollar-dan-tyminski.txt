Another day, another dollar

[Verse 1]
 
N.C.                      G
I'm just trying to make a living
G                     C
Working jobs that I enjoy
G                          G
 But it ain't easy finding something
         D                G  C  G
For this lonesome-hearted boy
 
[Chorus]
 
N.C.                  G
Another day, another dollar
G                             C
That's what I'm working for today
G                     G
 Another day, another dollar
           D             G  C  G
Sure can't buy my blues away
 
[Instrumental]
 
G    G    C    G    D  G  C  G
 
N.C.                       G
You know my life is like a highway
G                      C
Just too many roads to take
G                              G
 You know I'll try to take the right one
          D            G  C  G
Just gets harder every day
 
[Chorus]
 
N.C.                  G
Another day, another dollar
G                             C
That's what I'm working for today
G                     G
 Another day, another dollar
           D             G  C  G
Sure can't buy my blues away

That's what I'm working for today, hey
G                     G
 Another day, another dollar
           D             G  C  G
Sure can't buy my blues away

Sure can't buy my blues away
