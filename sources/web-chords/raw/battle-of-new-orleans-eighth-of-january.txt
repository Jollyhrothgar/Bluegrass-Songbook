Verse 1:
G                      C
Well, in 18 and 14, we took a little trip
D                                 G
Along with Col. Jackson down the mighty Mississip'
    G                        C
We took a little bacon & we took a little beans
       D                               G
And we met the bloddy British near the town of New Orleans
 
Chorus 1:
   G
We fired our guns & the British kept a-comin'
G                                 D             G
There wasn't nigh as many as they was a while ago
   G
We fired once more and they began a run-ning
G                           D           G
Down the MIssissippi to the Gulf of Mexico
 
Verse 2:
G                                 C
Well I see'd Marse Jackson come a-walkin' down the street
       D                          G
And a-talking to a pirate by the name of Jean Lafitte
    G                           C
He gave Jean a drink that he'd brung from Tennessee
        D                                  G
And the pirate said he'd help us drive the British to the sea
 
Verse 3:
G                            C
Well the French told Andrew "You had better run
     D                            G
'For Packenham's a-comin' with a bullet in his gun"
    G               C
Old Hickory said he didn't give a damn
       D                                    G
He's a-gonna  whup the britches off of Col. Packenham
 
Verse 4:
G                                  C
Well,we looked down the river & we seed the British come
          D                               G
And there must have been a hundred of 'em beatin' on the drum
      G                        C
They stepped so high and they made their bugles ring
         D                               G
While we stood beside our cotton bales & didn't say a thing
 
Verse 5:
    G                     C
Old Hickory said we could take em by surprise
      D                            G
If we didn't fire a musket till we looked 'em in the eyes
   G                     C
We held our fire til we seed their faces well
        D                             G
Then we opened up our squirrel guns & really gave 'em well..
 
Chorus 2:
          G
Well they ran thru the briars & they ran thru the brambles
         G                           D             G
And they ran thru the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go
     G
They ran so fast that the hounds couldn't catch 'em
G                           D            G
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
 
Verse 6:
        G                          C
Well we fired our cannons till the barrels melted down
      D                           G
So we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round
    G                                   C
We filled his head with minie balls and powdered his behind
            D                             G
And when we touched the powder off, the 'gator lost his mind
 
Verse 7:
     G                        C
They lost their pants & their pretty shiny coats
          D                              G
And their tails wer all a-showin' like a bunch of billy goats
     G                            C
They ran down the river til their tongues were hangin' out
         D                                   G
And they said they got a lickin' which there wasn't any doubt
 
Verse 8:
     G                              C
Well we marched back to town in our dirty ragged pants
       D                          G
And we danced all night with them pretty firls from France
   G                                C
We couldn't understand 'em but they had the sweetest charms
       D                             G
And we understood 'em better when we got 'em in our arms
 
Verse 9:
         G                   C
Well the guide who brung the British from the sea
       D                         G
Came a-limpin' into camp just as sick as he could be
   G                        C
He said the dyin' words of Col. Packenham
      D                                  G
Was "You'd better quit foolin' with your cousin Uncle Sam'
 
Verse 10:
            G                    C
Well, we'll march back home, but we'll never be content
        D                    G
Till we make Old Hick'ry the people's president.
    G                             C
And every time we think about the bacon and the beans
      D                          G
We'll think about the fun we had way down in New Orleans.
