A Beautiful Life
by William Golden
 
 
[Verse 1]
G             C    F      C
Each day I'll do a golden deed
           G                C
By helping those who are in need
G          C        F     C
My life on earth is but a span
            G             C   F  C G
And so I'll do the best I can
 
 
[Chorus]
                C             F
Life's evening sun is sinking low
           G               C  G
A few more days and I must go
             C         F       C
To meet the deeds that I have done
                       G        C   F C
Where there will be no setting sun
 
 
[Verse 2] (same chords as Verse 1)
 
To be a child of God each day
My light must shine along the way
I'll sing His praise while the ages roll
And strive to help some troubled soul
 
 
[Chorus]
 
 
The only life that will endure
Is one that's kind and good and pure
And for God, I'll take my stand
Each day I'll lend a helping hand
 
 
[Chorus]
 
 
While going down life's weary road
I'll try to lift some traveller's load
I'll try to turn the night to day
Make flowers bloom along the way
