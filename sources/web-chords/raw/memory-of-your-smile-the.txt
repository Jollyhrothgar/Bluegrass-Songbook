[Intro]
G G D D
G G
 
[Verse 1]
C                           G
I'm walking from one bar to another
G                      D                   G
I don't know where I'm going or where I've been
C
No one I meet realizes
C   D                          G
I'm trying when I know I can't win
 
 
[Chorus]
G
The memory of your smile, it nearly drives me wild
G                  D             G
Ain't nothing ever gonna ease my mind
G
I thought you'd true, I counted so on you
G               D               G
I'm lost from a love I'll never find
 
 
[Instrumental]
D D G G
 
 
[Verse 2]
C                                  G
I wonder how this pain is going to wind up
G       D                             G
It gets worse day by day since you're gone
C                 D             G
If only you would come back and see me
D                              G
You're my only chance from now on
 
 
[Chorus]
G
The memory of your smile, it nearly drives me wild
G                  D             G
Ain't nothing ever gonna ease my mind
G
I thought you'd true, I counted so on you
G               D               G
I'm lost from a love I'll never find
