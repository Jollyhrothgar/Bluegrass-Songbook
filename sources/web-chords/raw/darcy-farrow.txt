          D                       G             D
Where the Walker runs down to the Carson Valley plain
D             Dmaj7         Em7            A7
There lived a maiden, Darcy Farrow was her name
    D                             G            D
The daughter of old Dundee, and a fair one was she
    G    A7  D      G     D      A7       D
The sweetest flower that bloomed o'er the range
 
    D                         G        D
Her voice was as sweet as the sugar candy
    D            Dmaj7     Em7          A7
Her touch was as soft as a bed of goose down
    D                          G      D
Her eyes shone bright like the pretty lights
     G     A7     D     G      D   A7    D
That shine in the night out at Yerington town
 
D                  G           D
She was courted by young Vandermeer
D              Dmaj7     Em7     A7
A fine lad was he,    as I am to hear
   D                         G    D
He gave her silver rings and lacy things
   G   A7      D      G       D     A7        D
He promised to wed before the snows came that year
 
    D                    G       D
Her pony did stumble and she did fall
    D                 Dmaj7        Em7     A7
Her dying touched the hearts of us one and all
      D                       G                  D
Young Vandy in his pain put a bullet through his brain
   G      A7      D     G      D        A7    D
We buried them together as the snows began to fall
 
     D                              G            D
They sing of Darcy Farrow where the Truckee runs through
     D           Dmaj7        Em7        A7
They sing of her beauty in Virginia City too
   D                    G                 D
At dusky sundown to her name they drink a round
    G  A7    D  G         D    A7  D
And to young Vandy, whose love was true
