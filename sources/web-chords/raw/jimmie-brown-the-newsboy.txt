Jimmy Brown The Newsboy
Mac Wiseman
Album: 24 Greatest Hits (2006)
 
G
I sell the morning paper, sir
                   D
My name is Jimmy Brown, 
 
Everybody knows I am,
                    G
The Newsboy of the town.
 
G
You will hear me yelling "Morning Star", 
                     D
As I run along the street, 
 
I have no hat up on my head,
                  G
No shoes upon my feet.
 
G
I have no hat up on my head, 
     C            G
No shoes upon my feet
 
G
I'm awful cold and hungry, sir, 
                         D
My clothes are worn and thin, 
 
I wander 'bout from place to place,
                   G
My daily bread to win.
 
G
Never mind, sir, how I look, 
                      D
Don't look at me and frown, 
 
I sell the morning papers, sir,
                  G
My name is Jimmy Brown.
 
G
I sell the morning papers, sir, 
    C             G
My name is Jimmy Brown.
 
G
My Father died a drunkard, sir, 
                      D
I've heard my Mother say,
 
And I am helping Mother, sir,
                   G
As I journey on my way.
 
G
Mother always tells me, sir, 
                               D
I've nothing in this world to lose,
 
I'll get a place in Heaven, sir,
                    G
To sell the Gospel News.
 
G
Never mind sir how I look,
                       D
Don't look at me and frown,
 
I sell the morning papers, sir,
                  G
My name is Jimmy Brown.
 
G
I sell the morning papers, sir,
    C             G
My name is Jimmy Brown
