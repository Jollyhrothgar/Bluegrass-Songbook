Capo 2nd fret
 
[Chorus]
              G                            G7
Drinkin’ dark whiskey, tellin' white lies
             G    G7               D
One leads to another on a Saturday night
                     C                        G
Don't you cross your heart unless you hope to die
G                     D                 G
Drinkin’ dark whisk---ey, tellin' white lies
 
[Verse 1]
    G                                                    G7
The first drop burns but the second one goes down smooth
         C                                   G    G7
And then that old black label gets a hold of you
      D                                             G
It'll loosen your tongue but it don't ever tell the truth
 
[Chorus]
              G                            G7
Drinkin’ dark whiskey, tellin' white lies
             G    G7               D
One leads to another on a Saturday night
                     C                        G
Don't you cross your heart unless you hope to die
G                     D                 G
Drinkin’ dark whisk---ey, tellin' white lies
 
[Instrumental]
G         G7
C    G    G7
D    G
 
[Verse 2]
         G                                             G7
When the bottle's talking, be careful what he might say
   C                                            G    G7
He talks in the dark like he never would in the day
        D                                           G
Then he gets in trouble just as soon as he gets his way
 
[Chorus]
              G                            G7
Drinkin’ dark whiskey, tellin' white lies
             G    G7               D
One leads to another on a Saturday night
                     C                        G
Don't you cross your heart unless you hope to die
G                     D                 G
Drinkin’ dark whisk---ey, tellin' white lies
 
[Instrumental]
G         G7
C    G    G7
D    G
 
[Verse 3]
  G                                         G7
A little white lie don't mean anyone no good
          C                                      G    G7
When it's making the rounds all over the neighborhood
     D                                 G
Next thing you know you're all misunderstood
 
[Chorus]
              G                            G7
Drinkin’ dark whiskey, tellin' white lies
             G    G7               D
One leads to another on a Saturday night
                     C                        G
Don't you cross your heart unless you hope to die
G                     D                 G
Drinkin’ dark whisk---ey, tellin' white lies
C              G       D                 G
Drinkin’ dark whisk---ey, tellin' white lies
