[Verse]
 G              C           G
Gee, but it's tough to be broke, kid.
            Am                G    D7
It's not a joke, kid, it's a curse.
G           C              G
My luck is changing, it's gotten from
        Am                 G     D7
simply rotten to something worse
E                          Am
Who knows, some day I will win too. 
      A7                C    D7
I'll begin to reach my prime.
G             C           G
Now though I see what our end is,
           Am               D7
All I can spend is just my time.
 
[Chorus]
G                             Am    D7
I can't give you anything but love, baby.
G                                 Am  D7
That's the only thing I've plenty of ,baby.
G
Dream awhile, scheme awhile
C
We're sure to find
A7
Happiness and I guess
Am                       D7
All those things you've always pined for.
 
G                               Am     D7
Gee I'd like to see you looking swell, baby.
G                                   Am    D7
Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, baby.
C               A7                  G     E
Till that lucky day you know darned well, baby.
Am                D7          G
I can't give you anything but love.
 
[Verse]
G           C          G
Rome wasn't built in a day, kid.
            Am                     G   D7
You have to pay, kid, for what you get.
G          C         G
But I am willing to wait, dear, 
            Am                   G      D7
Your little mate, dear, will not forget.
E                    Am
You have a lifetime before you.
      A7                  C  D7
I'll adore you, come what may.
G               C            G
Please don't be blue for the present, 
              Am                  D7
When it's so pleasant to hear you say
 
[Chorus]

I can't give you anything but love, baby.
G                                 Am  D7
That's the only thing I've plenty of ,baby.
