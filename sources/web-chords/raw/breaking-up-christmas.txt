[Intro]
C F G C
 
[Verse 1]
C                           F
 You tiptoed down the stairs at 7:35
G                   C
 I knew exactly what was running through your mind
C                            F
 Right there beside the tree, under the mistletoe
G                      C
 You said it's over and I hit the road
 
[Chorus]
C                              F
Why did we have to break up on Christmas?
G                                C
Why did we have to wait all damn year?
C                                  F
I could've crossed off all of your wishlist
G                                 C
Saved me a whole lot of money and tears
                       C
That necklace for your mom
                    F
Golf clubs for your dad
                 G
BarkBox for your dog
                       C
Now, that one's not so bad (Bad)
C                              F
I could've put the mall out of business
   G                             C
If we didn't wait to break up on Christmas
 
[Verse 2]
C                    F
 If it was Halloween, hell, even July 4th
G                       C
 Out in the pouring rain or love-drunk on your porch
C                          F
 I would've been just fine, okay, fine's not the word
G                C
 But on the 25th, it sure does hurt
 
[Chorus]
C                              F
Why did we have to break up on Christmas?
G                                C
Why did we have to wait all damn year?
C                                  F
I could've crossed off all of your wishlist
G                                 C
Saved me a whole lot of money and tears
                       C
That necklace for your mom
                    F
Golf clubs for your dad
                 G
BarkBox for your dog
                       C
Now, that one's not so bad (Bad)
C                              F
I could've put the mall out of business
   G                             C
If we didn't wait to break up on Christmas
 
[Interlude]
          C
Yeah, yeah
        F
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
        G
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
        C
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
 
C
Jingle bells, jingle bells
C
Jingle all the way
F                                 G            C
Why'd you have to go and wreck my favorite holiday?
 
Hey
 
[Chorus]
C                              F
Why did we have to break up on Christmas?
G                                C
Why did we have to wait all damn year?
C                                  F
I could've crossed off all of your wishlist
G                                 C
Saved me a whole lot of money and tears
                       C
That necklace for your mom
                    F
Golf clubs for your dad
                 G
BarkBox for your dog
                       C
Now, that one's not so bad (Bad)
C                              F
I could've put the mall out of business
   G                             C
If we didn't wait to break up on Christmas
