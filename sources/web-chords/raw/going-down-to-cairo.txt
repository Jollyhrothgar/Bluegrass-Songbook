The song is a 12 bar blues in D.  The pattern is essentially:
I   I   I   I
IV  IV  I   I
V   V   I   I
 
with a small twist.  Any bar that comes before a I (the D chord) is descending 4 chord
pattern of D C G F.  In this case, it is the 2nd bar, the 6th bar and the 10th bar.
The intro is just the 1st 4 bars played twice.
