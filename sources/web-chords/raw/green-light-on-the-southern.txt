[Intro]
D A D
 
 
[Verse 1]
                                 A            D
Standing on the sidetrack at the south end of town
                                  A
On a dry hot dusty august day the steam pipe pouring down
    D                             A                    D
The fireman with his long oil can oiling the old valve gears
                                    A            D
Waiting for the fast mail train the semaphore to clear
 
 
[Verse 2]
                                     A                 D
The engineer in the old high cab his gold watch in his hand
                              A
Looking at the waterglass and letting down the sand
D                                A             D
Rolling out on the old main line taking up the slack
                           A                 D
Gone today so they say but tomorrow he’ll be back
 
 
[Chorus]
        A     G D
Oh if I could return
         G               A
To those boyhood days of mine
        D
And the greenlight on the southern southern railroad line
 
 
[Instrumental]
D A D  x4
 
 
[Verse 3]
                                     A                 D
Creeping down the rusty rails of the weed grown branch line
                                         A
The section houses gray and white by the yard limit sign
    D                              A               D
The hoggers call the old high ball no more time to wait
                                  A               D
Rolling down to birmingham with a 10 car load for freight
 
 
[Chorus]
        A     G D
Oh if I could return
         G               A
To those boyhood days of mine
        D
And the greenlight on the southern southern railroad line
 
 
[Instrumental]
D A D  x4
 
 
[Verse 4]
                                            A                D
The whistle scream with a hiss of steam the headlight gleams clear
                                     A
The drivers roll on the green and go getting mighty near
D                            A              D
Handing up the orders to the engine crew on time
                                  A          D
It’s the Alabama great southern AGS railroad line
 
 
[Chorus]
        A     G D
Oh if I could return
         G               A
To those boyhood days of mine
        D
And the greenlight on the southern southern railroad line
 
 
[Outro]
        A     G D
Oh if I could return
         G               A
To those boyhood days of mine
        D
And the greenlight on the southern southern railroad line
