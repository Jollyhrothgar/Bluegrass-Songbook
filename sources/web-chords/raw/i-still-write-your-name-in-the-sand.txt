After doing some research, it appears that Buddy Starcher is the original artist of this song.
However, I cannot find a recording of him. This song has been recorded by many artists over
the years and in many different keys. I am going to keep it simple and post it here in the
key of C major. You only need three chords for this one. I like to play around with a maj7
on the third chord but just a plain major chord works as well. Enjoy!
 
C                                            F
It's been many years since we were childhood sweethearts
         C               G7
Blissful days I’ll never forget
    C                            F
You know I still love you little darling
           C              G7     C
Though the years bring me only regret
 
                               F
Oh I love you my darling how I love you
     C                         G7
If I talk will you try to understand
C                                      F
Makes no difference how you treat me I love you
    C                     G7          C
And I’ll still write your name in the sand
 
                                     F
Through the long lonely years I have loved you
         C                  G7
And I've waited but only in vain
      C                          F
Now I know that I've lost you my darling
      C              G7         C
But I still sing the same old refrain
 
                               F
Oh I love you my darling how I love you
     C                         G7
If I talk will you try to understand
         C                             F
Makes no difference how you treat me I love you
         C                G7          C
And I'll still write your name in the sand
 
                              F
Now I know that your heart is for another
       C                          G7
And it grieves me more than I can stand
            C                        F
Though I've lost the only one that I care for
     C                G7          C
I’ll still write your name in the sand
 
                               F
Oh I love you my darling how I love you
     C                         G7
If I talk will you try to understand
         C                             F
Makes no difference how you treat me I love you
         C                G7          C
And I'll still write your name in the sand
