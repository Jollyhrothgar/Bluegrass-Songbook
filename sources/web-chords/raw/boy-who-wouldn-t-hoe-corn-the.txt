[Verse 1]
 
Dm                                        Bb
Tell you a little story and it won't take long
C                                        Dm
'Bout a lazy farmer who wouldn't hoe his corn
Dm                           Bb
The reason why I never could tell
C                         Dm
That young man was always well
 
 
[Verse 2]
Dm                                  Bb
He planted his corn in the month of June
C                                        Dm
By July it was up to his eyes
Dm                              Bb
Come September there came a big frost
C                                Dm
And all the young man's corn was lost
 
 
[Verse 3]
Dm                       Bb
His courtship had just begun
C                                        Dm
Said young man, "Have you hauled some corn?"
Dm                                       Bb
"Well I tried and I tried and I tried in vain,
C                                 Dm
But I don't believe I raised one grain."
 
 
[Verse 4]
Dm                                       Bb
Well he went down town to his neighbor's door
C                        Dm
Where he had often been before
Dm                                       Bb
Sayin "Pretty little miss will you marry me,
C                        Dm
Little miss what do you say?"
 
 
[Verse 5]
Dm                          Bb
"Why do you come for me to wed?
C                                Dm
You can't even make your own cornbread
Dm                     Bb
Single I am and will remain.
C                         Dm
A lazy man I won't maintain."
 
 
[Verse 6]
Dm                            Bb
He turned his back and walked away
C                                Dm
Sayin "Little miss you'll rue the day.
Dm                                Bb
You'll rue the day that you were born
 C                                      Dm
Givin me the devil cause I wouldn't hoe corn."
