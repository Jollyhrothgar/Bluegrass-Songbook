[Chorus]
 
G                  D         C
Today I don't feel like doing anything
G            D        C
I just wanna lay in my bed
G                       D
Don't feel like picking up my phone
C
So leave a message at the tone
G                       B7       C
Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

    G                             D
Uh, I'm gonna kick my feet up and stare at the fan
C
Turn the TV on, throw my hand in my pants
G              D        C
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't, nah
 
G                                   D
I'll be lounging on the couch, just chillin' in my snuggie
C
Click to MTV so they can teach me how to dougie
G                  D               C
Cause in my castle I'm the freakin' man
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
       Am
Oh oh, yes I said it
Bm

[Chorus]
 
G                  D         C

G                       D
Don't feel like picking up my phone
C
So leave a message at the tone
G                       B7       C
Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything
 
Nothing at all

G                           D
Tomorrow I wake up, do some P90X
C
Meet a really nice girl, have some really nice sex
G                      D              C
And she's gonna scream out, "this is great" (Oh my God, this is great)
G                              D
I might mess around and get my college degree
C
I bet my old man will be so proud of me
G                      D           C
I'm sorry pops, you'll just have to wait

And let everything hang loose
Am                      D                        Em
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahhh
