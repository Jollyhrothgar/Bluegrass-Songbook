[Verse]
 
Am                             G
I'll sing it one last time for you
        Am             G
Then we really have to go
                 Am                  G
You've been the only thing that's right
             Am    G
In all I've done
 
            Am            G
And I can barely look at you
            Am           G
But every single time I do
              Am            G
I know we'll make it anywhere
         Am     G
Away from here
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C
Light up, light up
          G
As if you have a choice
                   Am
Even if you cannot hear my voice
                         F
I'll be right beside you dear
 
C
Louder, louder
                   G
And we'll run for our lives
                          Am
I can hardly speak, I understand
                                   F
Why you can't raise your voice to say
 
 
[Verse]
 
              Am                 G
To think I might not see those eyes
              Am              G
It makes it so hard not to cry
           Am               G
And as we say our long goodbyes
          Am    G
I nearly do
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C
Light up, light up
          G
As if you have a choice
                   Am
Even if you cannot hear my voice
                         F
I'll be right beside you dear
 
C
Louder, louder
                   G
And we'll run for our lives
                          Am
I can hardly speak, I understand
                                   F
Why you can't raise your voice to say
 
 
[Bridge]
 
C                             G
Slower, slower. We don't have time for that
                        Am
All I want is to find an easier way
                           F
To get out of our little heads
C                                   G
Have heart, my dear. We're bound to be afraid
                      Am
Even if it's just for a few days
                           F
Makin' up for all of this mess
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C
Light up, light up
          G
As if you have a choice
                   Am
Even if you cannot hear my voice
                         F
I'll be right beside you dear
