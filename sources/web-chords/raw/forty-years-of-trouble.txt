[Intro]
A   D   A   E
A   D   A   A   A
 
 
[Verse 1]
      A               D
Forty years I’ve been gone
            A                  E
I served my time, it’s been so long
         A                   D
I took a life, I know it was wrong
                A          E                 A
But I served my time, Lord knows I’m heading home
 
 
[Chorus]
         A             D
Shackled to a ball and chain
                A                     E
I worked in the snow, I worked in the rain
           A                      D
I laid the tracks, never rode the train
               A         E               A
Forty years of suffering, forty years of pain
 
 
[Interlude]
A   D   A   E
A   D   A   A   A
 
 
[Verse 2]
        A              D
I had a wife, a little queen
           A              E
I’ve got a son I’ve never seen
           A           D
All I have left now it seems
            A    E           A
Is a broken heart and broken dreams
 
 
[Chorus]
         A             D
Shackled to a ball and chain
                A                     E
I worked in the snow, I worked in the rain
           A                      D
I laid the tracks, never rode the train
               A         E               A
Forty years of suffering, forty years of pain
 
 
[Interlude]
A   D   A   E
A   D   A   A   A
 
 
[Verse 3]
        A                    D
Now I’m home, I’ve served my time
               A               E
My life's gone by so I sit and pine
       A             D
Nobody even knows my name
          A   E             A
I have no one but myself to blame
 
 
[Chorus]
         A             D
Shackled to a ball and chain
                A                     E
I worked in the snow, I worked in the rain
           A                      D
I laid the tracks, never rode the train
               A         E               A
Forty years of suffering, forty years of pain
 
 
[Interlude]
A   D   A   E
A   D   A E A
 
 
[Chorus]
         A             D
Shackled to a ball and chain
                A                     E
I worked in the snow, I worked in the rain
           A                      D
I laid the tracks, never rode the train
               A         E               A
Forty years of suffering, forty years of pain
               A          E              A
Forty years of suffering, forty years of pain
