G
There stands a rose, down in your garden.
            D7           G
You left it there, so all alone.
 
It's been neglected, feels unwanted
         D7            G
Since no love to it is shown.
 
 
Its beauty now, is fastly fading.
        D7                G
Once it was, the brightest red.
 
It's withering fast, its head is bowing
         D7                   G
Since no kind words, to it are said
 
 
Please don't neglect the rose in your garden.
             D7         G
Show it your love, every day.
 
It will bloom for you in all its beauty.
       D7            G
And it will not, fade away.
 
 
I guess by now, you know my story.
        D7                  G
Don't neglect, a love that's true
 
For it may prove to be, the sweetest flower.
          D7             G
That will never, bloom for you.
 
 
It could be your a mother, sister or brother.
          D7             G
A husband wife, or little child.
 
Or it may be, your own true lover.
         D7              G
You've neglected, all the while.
 
 
Please don't neglect the rose in your garden.
             D7         G
Show it your love, every day.
 
And it will bloom for you in all its beauty.
       D7            G
And it will not, fade away.
