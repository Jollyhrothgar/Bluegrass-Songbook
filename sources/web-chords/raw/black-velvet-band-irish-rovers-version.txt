[Chorus]
 
A
Her eyes they shone like the diamonds.
                                 E
You'd think she was Queen of the Land.
        A                  F#m
And her hair hung over her shoulder,
     D         E            A
tied up with a Black Velvet Band.
 
 
#1.
A
In a neat little town they call Belfast,
                           E
apprenticed to trade I was bound.
    A                          F#m
And many an hour of sweet happiness,
  D             E           A
I spent in that neat little town..
A
Till bad misfortune came over me and caused me
                  E
to stray from the land.
     A                             F#m
Far away from me friends and rela..ions I
D            E            A
followed the Black Velvet Band.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
A
Her eyes they shone like the diamonds.
                                 E
You'd think she was Queen of the Land.
        A                  F#m
And her hair hung over her shoulder,
     D         E            A
tied up with a Black Velvet Band.
 
 
#2.
A
Well, I went out strolling one evening, not
                   E
meaning to go very far..
       A                          F#m
When I met with a ficklesome dam..sel, she was
D          E            A
plying her trade in the bar.
A
When a watch she took from a customer, and
                         E
slipped it right into me hand..
        A                            F#m
And the law came and put me in pris..on, bad
D           E            A
luck to her Black Velvet Band.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
A
Her eyes they shone like the diamonds.
                                 E
You'd think she was Queen of the Land.
        A                  F#m
And her hair hung over her shoulder,
     D         E            A
tied up with a Black Velvet Band.
 
 
#3.
A
This mornin' before judge and jury, for a trial,
             E
I had to ap..pear.
        A                        F#m
And the judge he says, 'Me young fellow, the
D            E            A
case against you is quite clear.
A
And seven long years is your sentence, you're
                     E
going to Van Daemons Land.
     A                                F#m
Far away from your friends and relat..ions and
D          E            A
follow the Black Velvet Band.'
 
 
[Chorus]
 
A
Her eyes they shone like the diamonds.
                                 E
You'd think she was Queen of the Land.
        A                  F#m
And her hair hung over her shoulder,
     D         E            A
tied up with a Black Velvet Band.
 
 
#4.
A
So, come all ye jolly young fellows, I'll have you
                  E
take warnin' from me.
      A                    F#m
When..ever you're into the liquor, me lads,
  D           E      A
beware of the pretty Colleen.
A
For they'll fill you with whiskey and porter, till you
                E
are not able to stand.
        A                                 F#m
And the very next thing that you know, me lads, you've
D         E            A
landed in Van Daemon's Land.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
A
Her eyes they shone like the diamonds.
                                 E
You'd think she was Queen of the Land.
        A                  F#m
And her hair hung over her shoulder,
     D         E            A
tied up with a Black Velvet Band.
 
 
[Outro]
[Chorus]
 
A
Her eyes they shone like the diamonds.
                                 E
You'd think she was Queen of the Land.
        A                  F#m
And her hair hung over her shoulder,
     D         E            A
tied up with a Black Velvet Band.
