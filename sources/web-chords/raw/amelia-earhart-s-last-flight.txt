AMELIA EARHART'S LAST FLIGHT
As recorded by Plainsong
(From the 1972 Album IN SEARCH OF AMELIA EARHART)
 
[Verse 1]
N.C.   G
Just a ship out on the ocean
       C                 A
Just a speck against the sky
D                                G  D
Amelia Earhart, flying out that day
            G
With her partner, Captain Noonan
       C              A
On the first day of July
    D                        G
She fell into the ocean far away
 
[Chorus]
G             C          Cm        G
And there's a beautiful, beautiful field
                   C       D
Far away in a land that is fair
      G                       C
Happy landings to you, Amelia Earhart
    D                       G
Farewell, first lady of the air
 
[Bridge]
G      D         G   Em
Twenty minutes later
   C          A
An S.O.S. was heard
  D                   Bm        A       G     D
A voice that came was weak, but sounded brave
       G       Am       Bm   Em
In the shark-infested waters
          Am             C
Her plane came down that day
        D                         G
And our heroes fell into a watery grave
 
[Chorus]
G             C          Cm        G
And there's a beautiful, beautiful field
                   C       D
Far away in a land that is fair
      G                       C
Happy landings to you, Amelia Earhart
    D                       G
Farewell, first lady of the air
 
[Guitar Solo]
G   C  A  D  G D
G  C A7 D   G
 
[Bridge]
G          D        G Em
Now you've heard my story
     C          A7
This awful tragedy
   D                                G C D
We pray that she may fly home safe again
       G        A             B
And in years to come, though others
Em      Am               C   Em
Blaze a trail across the sea
        D             Bm  D       G
We'll never forget Amelia and her plane
 
[Chorus]
G             C          Cm        G
And there's a beautiful, beautiful field
                   C       D
Far away in a land that is fair
      G                       C
Happy landings to you, Amelia Earhart
    D                       C G
Farewell, first lady of the air
 
[Outro]
