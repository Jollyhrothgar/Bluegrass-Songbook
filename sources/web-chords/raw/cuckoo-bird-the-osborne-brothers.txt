[Chorus]
G                      Em
Oh, the cuckoo she's a pretty bird
    C              D
She warbles as she flies
      G              Em
But I never give her water
         C             D        G
Till the fourth day of July
 
 
[Verse 1]
G                  Em
It is often that I wonder
    C          D
Why women love men
      G               Em
And I look back and I wonder
    C       D
Why men are men
 
 
[Chorus]
G                      Em
Oh, the cuckoo she's a pretty bird
    C              D
She warbles as she flies
      G              Em
But I never give her water
         C             D        G
Till the fourth day of July
 
 
[Verse 2]
G                Em
Gonna build me a castle
     C           D
On a mountain so high
        G            Em
So then I can see my true love
   C          D
As she passes by
 
 
[Chorus]
G                      Em
Oh, the cuckoo she's a pretty bird
    C              D
She warbles as she flies
      G              Em
But I never give her water
         C             D        G
Till the fourth day of July
 
 
[Instrumetal]
 G  Em C D G Em C D G
 
 
[Verse 3]
G                 Em
Jack of Diamonds, Jack of Diamonds
  C           D
I know you of old
         G              Em
You have robbed my poor pockets
   C             D
Of silver and of gold
 
 
[Chorus]
G                      Em
Oh, the cuckoo she's a pretty bird
    C              D
She warbles as she flies
      G              Em
But I never give her water
         C             D        G
Till the fourth day of July
