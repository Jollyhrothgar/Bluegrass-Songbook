[Verse 1]
    D                      A                   A7
You ought to see my Cindy, she lives 'way down South.
D                   G          D        A        D
She's so sweet, the honeybees, swarm a-round her mouth.
 
[Chorus]
          G                             D
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy. Get along home (Cindy, Cindy).
G                                  D     A       D
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy. I'll marry you someday.
 
[Verse 2]
    D                      A                       A7
The first I seen my Cindy, she was standing in the door.
D                       G                D        A      D
Her shoes and stockings in her hand, her feet all on the floor.
 
[Chorus]
          G                             D
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy. Get along home (Cindy, Cindy).
G                                  D     A       D
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy. I'll marry you someday.
 
[Verse 3]
   D                     A              A7
I wish I was an apple, a-hangin' from a tree,
D                 G                   D             A      D
and every time my Cindy passed, she'd take a little bite-a-me.
 
[Chorus]
          G                             D
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy. Get along home (Cindy, Cindy).
G                                  D     A       D
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy. I'll marry you someday.
 
[Verse 4]
           D                          A              A7
Well, it's apples in the summer time, peaches in the Fall.
D                 G               D          A       D
If I can't have the gal I want, I won't have none at all.
 
[Chorus]
          G                             D
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy. Get along home (Cindy, Cindy).
G                                  D     A       D
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy. I'll marry you someday.
 
[Verse 5]
      D                     A                     A7
Cindy hugged and kissed me, she hung her head and cried.
D                   G                    D    A        D
I swore she was the prettiest thing that ever lived or died.
 
[Chorus]
          G                             D
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy. Get along home (Cindy, Cindy).
G                                  D     A       D
Get along home, Cindy, Cindy. I'll marry you someday.
 
[Outro]
     D   A     D
I'll marry you someday...
