[Intro]
A  G A  G
 
[Verse 1]
A
Woke up cold one Tuesday,
Cadd9                 G
I'm looking tired and feeling quite sick,
A                                             Cadd9      E
I felt like there was something missing in my day to day life,
     A
so I quickly opened the wardrobe,
Cadd9                       G
pulled out some jeans and a T-Shirt that seemed clean,
A
topped it off with a pair of old shoes,
          Cadd9             E
that were ripped around the seams,
              G
and I thought these shoes just don't suit me.
 
[Chorus]
A               E
Hey, I put some new shoes on,
    D
and suddenly everything is right,
        A               E
I said, hey, I put some new shoes on
    D
and everybody's smiling, it's so inviting,
    A                   E
Oh, short on money, but long on time,
D
slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine,
    A
and I'm running late,
            E
and I don't need an excuse,
           D
'cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes.
 
[Verse 2]
A
Woke up late one Thursday,
Cadd9                   G
I'm seeing stars as I'm rubbing my eyes,
      A
and I felt like there were two days missing,
      Cadd9          E
as I focused on the time,
      A
and I made my way to the kitchen,
Cadd9                        G
but I had to stop from the shock of what I found,
A                              Cadd9             E
a room full of all my friends dancing round and round,
              G
and I thought hello new shoes, bye bye blues.
 
[Chorus]
A               E
Hey, I put some new shoes on,
    D
and suddenly everything is right,
        A               E
I said, hey, I put some new shoes on
    D
and everybody's smiling, it's so inviting,
    A                    E
Oh, short on money, but long on time,
D
slowly strolling in the sweet sunshine,
    A
and I'm running late,
            E
and I don't need an excuse,
           D
'cause I'm wearing my brand new shoes.
 
[Breakdown]
A
Take me wandering through these streets,
A                                    Cadd9
where bright lights and angels meet,
A
stone to stone they take me on,
    Dsus2
I'm walking to the break of dawn.
A
Take me wandering through these streets,
A                                    Cadd9
where bright lights and angels meet,

stone to stone they take me on,
    A
I'm walking to the break of dawn.
