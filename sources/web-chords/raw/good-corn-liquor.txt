The SteelDrivers - Good Corn Liquor
 
It's a pretty simple tune, I believe they play the same progression through the whole
song, playing E or A the whole time, other than when he says "Good Corn Liquor" at the end
of every phrase. At that time, I do a little run that goes G F# E and then I go into the
E. I usually play the notes at the same time I say each word, so when I sing "Good" I
hit the G, "Corn" I hit the F#, and "Liquor" I hit the E and then go into a strum.
 
Longer A and A G F# measures are 6 beats.

Well, the sun don't shine
     E
On a moonshine still
A                                   E
Copper line hiding in the side of a hill
      E
It'll get you there
      E
It'll get you there quicker
A                      G    F#   E
Fruit jar full of that good corn liquor

[Verse 1]
         E
Now when I was young
      E
About five or six
A                                   E
Daddy lost his job and my mama took sick
        E
And the times got tough
    E
And mama got sicker
A                          G    F#   E
Daddy started running that good corn liquor
 
[Chorus]
          E
Well, the sun don't shine
     E
On a moonshine still
A                                   E
Copper line hiding in the side of a hill
      E
It'll get you there
      E
It'll get you there quicker
A                      G    F#   E
Fruit jar full of that good corn liquor

[Verse 2]
    E
I remember that night
         E
It was a blood red moon
    A                              E
And daddy was doing what he had to do
         E
When the shots rang out
        E
And the sheriff pulled the trigger
    A                          G    F#   E
And daddy stopped running that good corn liquor
 
[Chorus]
          E
Well, the sun don't shine
     E
On a moonshine still
A                                   E
Copper line hiding in the side of a hill
      E
It'll get you there
      E
It'll get you there quicker
A                      G    F#   E
Fruit jar full of that good corn liquor
 
[Outro]
| E    | E    | E    | E    |
