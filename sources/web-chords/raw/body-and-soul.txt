[Intro]
 
Ebm7 Bb7#9 Ebm7 Bb7#9
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
Ebm7         Bb9     Ebm7 Ab7b5 DbMA7           F#7       Fm7        Edim
 My heart is sad and lonely,          for you I sigh, for you, dear, only
Ebm7             Cm7b5 F7 Bbm7            Ebm7 Ab9#5    DbMA7 Fm7 Bb7b9
 Why haven't you seen it?     I'm all for you  body and soul
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
Ebm7        Bb9     Ebm7 Ab7b5 DbMA7              F#7      Fm7       Edim
 I spend my days in longing,        and wondering why it's me you're wronging
Ebm7          Cm7b5 F7 Bbm7             Ebm7 Ab9#5 DbMA7 Em7 A7
 I tell you I mean it.      I'm all for you  body and soul
 
 
[Chorus]
 
D           Em7            Dadd9       Gm7  C7        F#m7  Bm7    Em7 A7 D D6
 I can't be-lieve it, it's hard to con-ceive it, that you'd turn a-way ro-mance
Dm7          G9          CMA7           Ebdim
 Are you pre-tending, it looks like the ending
 Dm7            G7   G7+      C7     B7 Bb7    E9b5
Un-less I could have one more chance to prove, dear
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
Ebm7       Bb9          Ebm7 Ab7b5 DbMA7             F#7       Fm7      Edim
 My life a wreck you're making,         you know I'm yours for just the taking
Ebm7          Cm7b5   F7 Bbm7           Ebm7 Ab9#5   DbMA7 Bb7#9
 I'd gladly sur-ren - der     myself to you, body and soul
Ebm7       Ab9#5 Ab7b5     Db6
 Myself to you,   body and soul
