[Intro]
Dm C Dm C
 
[Chorus]
                C
It's a lonesome feeling when you're traveling
                                     F
Down a lonesome road down a lonesome road
       Dm              C
Nobody cares a thing about me
             Dm                 C
It's a heavy load, it's a heavy load
 
 
[Verse]
          C
I fell in love in Cincinnati
                                  F
Her love was true and she told me so
           Dm               C
I gave her rings and all my money
              Dm                C
Where she ran off to I'll never know
 
 
[Chorus]
                C
It's a lonesome feeling when you're traveling
                                     F
Down a lonesome road down a lonesome road
       Dm              C
Nobody cares a thing about me
             Dm                 C
It's a heavy load, it's a heavy load
 
 
[Instrumental]
Dm C Dm C
 
 
[Verse]
            C
I wish that I was in Kentucky
                   F
With papa and mama dear
           Dm             C
But mama's gone and so is papa
       Dm                      C
And Kentucky's a long way from here
 
 
[Chorus]
                C
It's a lonesome feeling when you're traveling
                                     F
Down a lonesome road down a lonesome road
       Dm              C
Nobody cares a thing about me
             Dm                 C
It's a heavy load, it's a heavy load
             Dm                 C
It's a heavy load, it's a heavy load
