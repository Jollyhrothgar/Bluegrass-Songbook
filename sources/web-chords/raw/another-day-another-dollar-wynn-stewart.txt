[Intro]
E
 
[Chorus]
        E
Another day, another dollar
         A                E
Daylight comes, I'm on my way
        A            E
Another day, another dollar
        B7             E
Working my whole life away
 
 
[Verse 1]
              E
The boss told me I'd get paid weekly
            A              E
And that's exactly how I'm paid
        A            E
Another day, another dollar
        B7             E   N.C.
Working my whole life away
 
 
[Chorus]
        E
Another day, another dollar
         A                E
Daylight comes, I'm on my way
        A            E
Another day, another dollar
        B7             E
Working my whole life away

[Verse 2]
       E
My family is my thanksgiving
            A                  E
I love them more and more each day
            A             E
They're the reason I keep living
            B7             E   N.C.
And working my whole life away
 
 
[Chorus]
        E
Another day, another dollar
         A                E
Daylight comes, I'm on my way
        A            E
Another day, another dollar
        B7             E
Working my whole life away
 
        B7             E
Working my whole life away
        B7             E
Working my whole life away
