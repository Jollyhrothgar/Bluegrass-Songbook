DOWN IN THE VALLEY
As recorded by Burl Ives
(From the 1950 Album BALLADS AND FOLK SONGS, VOL. 2)
 
 
[Intro]
G
 
 
[Verse 1]
G                                D7
Down in the valley the valley so low
                                   G
Hang your head over, hear the wind blow
                                       D7
Hear the wind blow love, hear the wind blow
                                   G
Hang your head over, hear the wind blow
 
 
[Verse 2]
G                                  D7
Roses love sunshine, violets love dew
                              G
Angels in heaven, know I love you
                                   D7
Know I love you, dear, know I love you
                              G
Angels in heaven, know I love you
 
 
[Verse 3]
G                                   D7
If you don't love me, love whom you please
                                      G
Put your arms round me, give my heart ease
                                       D7
Give my heart ease love, give my heart ease
                                      G
Put your arms round me, give my heart ease
 
 
[Verse 4]
G                             D7
Write me a letter, send it by mail
                                   G
Send it in care of, the Birmingham Jail
                                 D7
Birmingham Jail love, Birmingham Jail
                                   G
Send it in care of, the Birmingham Jail
 
 
[Verse 5]
G                             D7
Build me a castle, forty feet high
                               G
So I can see her, as she rides by
                                   D7
As she rides by love, as she rides by
                               G
So I can see her, as she rides by
 
 
[Outro]
G                                 D7
Down in the valley, the valley so low
                                G
Hang your head over, hear the wind blow
