                            PAINT THIS TOWN
                        OLD CROW MEDICINE SHOW
 
CAPO: 3rd FRET
 
INTRO:
D A E    D D E
 
VERSE:
 E                          D A E
Ever since I was a young boy
E                     A A E
I had a wandering soul
E                                D     D
I walked and crawled across six state lines
E
By the time I was 8 years old
 
A
I  landed in some cornfield
 A
They called a town on the grow
      E                              D
So I climbed up on that water tower man
     D   E
But the city was a no show
 
     A
And that’s when I spied you but we didn’t mind
 A
All night truck stops, drive-ins, dives
          E
We were, teenage troubadours hopping on boxcars
       E
For a hell of a one-way ride
 
 
CHORUS:
B7
It’s just a Waffle House jukebox
B7                            E
My brains are scattered arou-ound
     A
But one of these days you and me babе
             A
We’re gonna spill the wholе bucket
 
                E
And paint this town
 D     D    E   A A E
Paint this town
 
 
VERSE:
 E
Paint it red and white for Old Glory
 D    D   E
Paint it blue for the cops tailing your old man’s Ford
 D     D        E                                  D
Shimmy up them power lines and paint some anarchy signs
               A           E
'Cause that’s what you do when you’re 15 years old
 
 A
We’ll paint it yellow for a warning
 A
They’ll never take us alive
           E
Now we’ve given our hearts to this heartbreak city
       E
Where farm kids go to make out or die
 
 
CHORUS:
Bm7                       B7
It’s just a Waffle House jukebox
B                             E
My brains are scattered arou-ound
     A
But one of these days you and me babе
             A
We’re gonna spill the wholе bucket
 
                E
And paint this town
 D     D    E
Paint this town
 
 
INSTRUMENTAL/SOLO:
C#m    C#m
E     E
C#m    C#m
B   E B
 
 
VERSE:
         E
Now the train don’t stop like it used to
            E
Interstate missed by more than a mile
 D     D         E
Still all these trailer park kids
                       A
That grow up thinking this
      E
Is a place they will survive
 
     A
And you and me babe we faded away
          A
Like the yearbook page foretold
     E
Now all we got left is the dirt under my fingernails from
 E
When we went digging for gold
 
 
CHORUS:
 B
It’s just a Waffle House jukebox
 B7
Bright lights spinning around
     A
But one of these days they just might light your way
          A
Make you spill the whole damn bucket
 
                E
And paint this town
 D     D    E
Paint this town
 D     D    E
Paint this town
 
D D E
D A E
