Blue Railroad Train

*Capo 3rd fret

 D                                                  G
D
Blue railroad train, goin' down the railroad track 
 G
Makes me feel so doggone blue, 
                           D
to listen to that old smokestack. 
                                               G D
Traverse a-rollin' on, leavin' me here behind 
 G
Give me back them good old days and let me ramble 
          D
down the line.

Blue railroad train, leavin' me here alone,
You treat me good, you treat me bad, 
you're makin' me think of home. 
I hear that lonesome train and love to hear the
whistle blow She's takin' the sun and leavin' the
rain,
and makin' me wanna go.  
Blue railroad train, blue railroad train, blue
railroad train 


I got the blues, longin' for some company. 
It's many miles from where I am, to the only one for
me. 
I'm so lonesome here, waitin' for the manifest, 
I hope that engineer is kind, enough to let me be his
guest. 


Blue railroad train, a good old pal of me, 
Takes me everywhere I wanna go, get my transportation
free. Blue railroad train, blue railroad train, blue
railroad train
