[Verse 1]
 
Em           D            Em
When I was a curly-headed baby
                D           Em
My daddy set me down on his knee
                      D                      Em
Saying "Son you go to school, you learn your letters
          C           D               Em
Don't you be no dusty miner, boy like me"
 
 
[Chorus]
 
      D                                          Em
I was born and raised at the mouth of the Hazard Holler
          D                                     Em
Where the coal carts rolled and rumbled past my door
                        D                  Em
But now they stand in a rusty row of all empties
            C         D          Em
Because the L&N don't stop here anymore
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
  Em               D           Em
I used to think my Daddy was a black man
                     D               Em
With scrip enough to buy the company store
                   D               Em
But now he goes to town with empty pockets
        C                       D        Em
And his face is as white as the February snow
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
      Em                  D                 Em
Never thought I'd live to learn to love the coaldust
                          D                  Em
Never thought I'd pray to hear those temples roar
                   D                   Em
But God I wish the grass would turn to money
              C                        D            Em
And then them greenbacks would fill my pockets once more
 
 
[Verse 4]
 
     Em                D                Em
Last night I dreamed I went down to the office
                 D           Em
To get my payday like I done before
                             D            Em
But them old kudzu vines was covering the doorway
               C                       D                     Em
And there was leaves and grass growing right up through the floor
 
 
[Chorus]
 
      D                                          Em
I was born and raised at the mouth of the Hazard Holler
          D                                     Em
Where the coal carts rolled and rumbled past my door
                        D                  Em
But now they stand in a rusty row of all empties
            C         D          Em
Because the L&N don't stop here anymore
