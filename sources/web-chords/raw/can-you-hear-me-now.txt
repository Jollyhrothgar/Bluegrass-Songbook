 capo 3 


Verse: 
G                        G   
O the walls are closin' in  
                    C 
I can feel it in my bones 
                           D 
Like water risin' up to my chin 
                         G 
Another long night to be alone 
                      G 
I could go out on the town 
                        C 
Talk too much and laugh too loud 
                         D 
If I'm already on my way down 
                              G 
I might as well just work the crowd 


[Chorus]
        C       G 
Can you hear me now 
        D 
Can you hear me now 
        C       G 
Can you hear me now 
        D       G 
Can you hear me now 


Verse: 
                      G 
O the stories I could tell 
                          C 
Sometimes I really hit my stride 
                                   D  
We make our own Heaven and our own Hell 
                              G 
Tryin' to get across to the other side  
                         G 
But everyday ends up the same 
                       C  
One step up, two steps back  
                           D 
Like some old silent movie frame  
                         G 
Zoom in close, then fade to black 


[Chorus]
        C       G 
Can you hear me now 
        D 
Can you hear me now 
        C       G 
Can you hear me now 
        D       G 
Can you hear me now 


Bridge: 

C                             Em 
How did the load get to be so heavy  
  G                              C 
I used to wear my troubie like a crown  
Em                            C 
A bad flood's poundin' on the levee 
        G 
And l'm gonna need some help  
           D 
To hold my ground 


Instrumental 

Verse: 
                       G 
But I'm sinkin' like a stone 
                                    C 
To where in solitude this life I'll spend 
                               D 
In the coldest place I've ever known 
                            G         
I'm here just waitin' until the end  
                G 
I send up my S.O.S. 
                            C 
A message in a bottle set out to sea 
                          D 
It just reads "Soul in distress"  
                            G 
But nobody ever got back to me 


[Chorus] 
        C       G 
Can you hear me now 
        D 
Can you hear me now 
        C       G 
Can you hear me now 
        D       G 
Can you hear me now 

        C       G 
Can you hear me now 
        D 
Can you hear me now 
        C       G 
Can you hear me now 
        D       G 
Can you hear me now
