[Verse]
G
Wake up, wake up darlin Corey
G
Tell me what makes you sleep so sound
G                F        G
The revenue officers are comin
        G        D           G
Gonna tear your still house down
 
[Chorus]
G
Dig a hole, dig a hole in the meadow
G
Dig a hole in the cold, cold ground
G                  F           G
Dig a hole, dig a hole in the meadow
                   D
Gonna lay darlin Corey down
 
[Verse]
G
Oh the first time I saw darlin Corey
G
She was standin in the door
G                           F               G
She had her shoes and her stockings in her hand
          D
And her little bare feet on the floor
 
 
G
Oh the next time I saw darlin Corey
G
She was standin by the banks of the sea
G                F                G
she had a 44 strapped around her bosom
        D            G
And a banjo on her knee
 
G
Oh the last time I saw darlin Corey
G
She had a wine glass in her hand
G                F
She was drinkin that sweet liquor
         D               G
With a low down gamblin man.
