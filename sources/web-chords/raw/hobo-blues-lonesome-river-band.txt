Hobo Blues Lonesome River Band
 
C  G  D  C  G
 
       G
Got a hole in my pocket, I've done packed my ol' knapsack
                         D                  G
I got a train to catch a mile on down the track
 
Well, I've been hangin' around this old town way too many days
                       D             G
I got to ramble on, I must be on my way
 
CHORUS
           C                                                     G
I got the Hobo Blues I gotta go, gotta go, God, I got the Hobo Blues
               D
And when I hear that whistle blow, son
                          C                    G    C  G  D  C  G
I gotta move, gotta move, God, I got the Hobo Blues
 
 
           G
Well, some women try to hold me, but I keep on movin' on
                         D               G
Well, my hat don't hang nowhere for too long
 
Cause I'm caught up in the feeling of that same ol' great train song
                      D               G
I got the Hobo Blues deep down in my bones
 
CHORUS
 
        G
When I die, won't you bury me in an old box car
                      D          G
With a coffee can and my old guitar
 
But make sure that I'm close enough to hear that passin' train
                                D                  G
I got the freight train fever chuggin' through my veins
 
CHORUS
