Intro: Em  D  C  D (x2)
 
Em           D            C     D
I'm tired of spinning my wheels
Em         D                     C               D
I need to find a place where my heart can go to heal
Em         D                 C   D
I need to get there pretty quick
Em                   D               C                  D
Hey mister what you got out on that lot you can sell me in a pinch
 
Em                 D                C   D
Maybe one of them souped up muscle cars
Em             D                       C                D
The kind that makes you think you're stronger than you are
Em           D           C                  D
Color don't matter no I don't need leather seats
Em        D         C      D
All that really concerns me is
 
 
Chorus:
G    D    C               D
Spe--ed, how fast will it go, can it get me
G                  D
Over her quickly, zero to sixty 
C          D           G  D        C             D
Can it outrun her memor---y, yeah what I really need
      C  D  C
Is an open road
        D            Em  D  C  D (x2)
And a whole lot of speed
 
 
Em           D                  C   D
I'd like to trade in this old truck
Em                  D               C                 D
Cause it makes me think of her and that just slows me up
Em              D                  C             D
See, it's the first place we made love where we used to sit and 
Em           D                  C                  D
Talk on the tailgate all night long but now she's gone
 (N.C.)
And I need to move on, so give me
 
 
Chorus (2):
G    D    C               D
Spe--ed, how fast will it go, can it get me
G                  D
Over her quickly, zero to sixty 
C          D           G  D        C             D
Can it outrun her memor---y, yeah what I really need
      C  D  C
Is an open road
        D            C        D (one strum)
And a whole lot of speed
 
 
C                                                     D (one strum)
Throw me them keys so I can put some miles between us
C                                                              D (one strum)
Tear off that rearview mirror there's nothing left to see here
C                                                D
Let me lean on that gas, oh she catches up fast, so give me
 
 
REPEAT FIRST CHORUS
 
 
               Em  D  C  D
That's what I need
Em            D            C    D
I'm tired of spinning my wheels
Em            D            C    D
I'm tired of spinning my wheels
