[Verse 1]
                 C
You're falling asleep
          D7           F
On my shoulder in the back of your boyfriend's car
              C
We're coming home
         D7               F
From a sermon saying how bent and evil we are
           C                   D7
I try to imagine what you're dreaming
                   F
You're muttering nonsense between steady breathing
            C                 D7
I have to wake you up to get out
                         F
Your man waves from the end of the drive 'til I'm in the house
 
 
[Chorus]
           Am7       Cmaj7/G
He can be nice, sometimes
                    F
Other nights, you admit he's not what you had in mind
        C              D7
All in all, nobody's perfect
               F
Therе may be better, but you don't feel worth it
                   C      D7   F   F
That's whеre we disagree
 
C   D7   F   F
 
 
[Verse 2]
             C         D7          F
You always wanted to raise a baby by the lake
               C            D7             F
Maybe they'll grow up and never make the same mistakes
         Am7                 Cmaj7/G      F
Knowing you, they'd be the first kid to never hurt another
            C              D7                   F
I see you look at him and wonder if he'll make you a mother
 
 
[Outro]
                 Am7          Cmaj7/G
But if you get married, I'd object
                       F
Throw my shoe at the altar and lose your respect
            C         D7
I'd rather lose my dignity
                     F
Than lose you to somebody who won't make you happy
