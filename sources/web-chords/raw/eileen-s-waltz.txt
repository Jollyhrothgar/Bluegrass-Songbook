[Verse 1]
 
Em                   G
First the mic then a half cigarette
C        A7       D
Singing "Cathy's Clown"
           Am                   Em
That's the man she's married to now
Am/F#                    B7
That's the girl that he takes around town
       Em                   G
She appears composed so she is I suppose
C        A7    D
Who can really tell
     Am                 Em
She shows no emotion at all
Am/F#                     B7
Stares into space like a dead china doll
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Em         G     C        G       C          G        D
I'm never gonna know you now, but I'm gonna love you anyhow

[Verse 2]
 
Em                          G
Now she's done and they're calling someone
C         A7    D
Such a familiar name
        Am                     Em
I'm so glad that my memory's remote
         Am/F#                   B7
Cos I'm doing just fine, hour to hour, note to note
Em                G
Here it is the revenge to the tune
C      A7  D
You're no  good
          Am                              Em
You're no good, you're no good, you're no good
Am/F#                     B7
Can't you tell that it's well understood
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Em         G     C        G       C          G        D

G G# Am (transition)
 
Am                  C               G      D    Em
I'm here today and expected to stay on and on and on
     Am
I'm tired
    Cmaj7
I'm tired
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
Em                  G
Looking out on the substitute scene
C      A7 D
Still going strong
 Am   Em
XO   mom
Am/F#              B7
It's okay, it's alright, nothing's wrong
Em                  G
Tell Mr. Man with impossible plans
        C     A7   D
To just leave me alone
        Am                     Em
In the place where I make no mistakes
Am/F#                B7
In the place where I have what it takes
 
Em         G     C        G       C          G        D
I'm never gonna know you now, but I'm gonna love you anyhow
Em         G     C        G       C          G        D
I'm never gonna know you now, but I'm gonna love you anyhow
Em         G     C        G       C          G        D
I'm never gonna know you now, but I'm gonna love you anyhow
