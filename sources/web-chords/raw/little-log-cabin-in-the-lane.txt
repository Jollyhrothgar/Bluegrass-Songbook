[Verse 1]
G                                C              G
I'm getting old and feeble and I cannot find my way
                                   D7
I’ll never see those good old days again
          G                                    C               G
While the years will swiftly pass the time and turn my hair to gray
                     D7           G
In my little old log cabin in the lane
 
[Verse 2]
       C                              G
Oh the chimney's falling down and the roof is all caved in
                                D7
Letting in the sunshine and the rain
        G                              C               G
And the only friend I have now is that good old dog of mine
                      D7           G
And my little old log cabin in the lane
 
[Verse 3]
G                                  C            G
I was once so free and happy and I never knew a care
                                  D7
My wife and little children by my side
    G                              C             G
Our little home was humble and the happiness was there
                         D7               G
Was the dearest place in all the world so wide
 
[Verse 4]
G                                   C            G
Till I take my final journey I will try to do my best
                                     D7
Though sad and heavy-hearted all the day
    G                            C             G
I’m waiting for the summons to a happy land of rest
                   D7         G
And a mansion in a valley far away
