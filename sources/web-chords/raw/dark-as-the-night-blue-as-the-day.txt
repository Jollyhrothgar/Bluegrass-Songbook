[Verse 1]
C            C         C          C
Dark as the night and blue as the day
        C                G7             C
I’m lonesome my darling since you went away
 
[Verse 2]
     C               C
Sometimes I wonder why did you stray
                       G7              C
It’s dark as the night I’m blue as the day
 
[Chorus]
            F                         C
Dark as the night there’s blues in my heart
       C                              G7
It’s cold outside since we’ve been apart
               C                   C
Tell me please tell me why you betrayed
       C                  G7              C
It’s dark as the night I’m blue as the day
 
 Repeat chords from Verses 1 and 2 instrumentally
 
[Chorus]
            F                         C
Dark as the night there’s blues in my heart
                                   G7
It’s cold outside since we’ve been apart
               C
Tell me please tell me why you betrayed
      C                   G7              C
It’s dark as the night I’m blue as the day
       C                  G7              C
It’s dark as the night I’m blue as the day
