[Verse]
 C         C7              F        Fm   C           G7     C
Look down, look down that lonesome road, be-fore you travel on
 C         C7        F          Fm    C          G7             C
Look up, look up and seek your maker, be-fore Gabriel blows his horn.
 
[Chorus]
 Am                      Em      Am                Em        G7
 I’m weary totin’ such a load, trudgin’ down that lonesome road

   Look down, look down that lonesome road, be-fore you travel on. 
 
[Verse]
 C         C7              F        Fm   C           G7     C
True love, true love, what have I done, that you should treat me so?
 C         C7              F        Fm   C           G7     C
You caused me to walk and talk, like I never did be-fore.
 
[Chorus]
 Am                      Em      Am                Em        G7
 I’m weary totin’ such a load, trudgin’ down that lonesome road
 C            C7              F        Fm    C           G7     C
   Look down, look down that lonesome road, be-fore you travel on,
 C         G7       C         G7 Fm C
Be-fore you travel on, be-fore you travel on
