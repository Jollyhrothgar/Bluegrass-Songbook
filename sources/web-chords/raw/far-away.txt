[Intro]
 
C  G  Am   F
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
C         G          Am
 This time, This place 
     F          C
Misused, Mistakes 
       G         Am
Too long, Too late 
        F              C
Who was I to make you wait 
            G
Just one chance 
           Am
Just one breath 
          F                     Dm
Just in case there's just one left 
  Dm
'Cause you know, 
      F        G
you know, you know 
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C       G
That I love you 
Am       F              C
I have loved you all along 
C       G
And I miss you 
Am         F                C
Been far away for far too long 
C        G       Am            F
I keep dreaming you'll be with me 
F                 C
and you'll never go 
C      G
Stop breathing 
Am          F
If I don't see you any more...
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
C         G          Am
On my knees, I'll ask 
     F                    C
Last chance for one last dance 
              G         Am
'Cause with you, I'd withstand 
        F                      C
All of hell to hold your hand 
             G
I'd give it all 
               Am
I'd give for us 
          F                       Dm
Give anything but I won't give up 
 
'Cause you know,
      F        G
you know, you know 
 
 
[Chorus]
 
C       G
That I love you 
Am       F              C
I have loved you all along 
C       G
And I miss you 
Am         F                C
Been far away for far too long 
C        G       Am            F
I keep dreaming you'll be with me 
F                 C
and you'll never go 
C      G
Stop breathing 
Am          F
If I don't see you any more...
 
 
[Bridge]
 
C        G         Am
So far away (Far away) 
Am         F                C
Been far away for far too long 
C        G         Am
So far away (Far away) 
Am         F                Dm
Been far away for far too long 
Dm                    F        G
But you know, you know, you know
 
C     G
I wanted 
Am    F            C
I wanted you to stay 
C           G
'Cause I needed 
Am          F
I need to hear you say...
