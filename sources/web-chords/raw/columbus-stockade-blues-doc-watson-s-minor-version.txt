[Introduction]
 
Am E7 Am  E7 Am
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
Am
Way down in Columbus Georgia
         E7                           Am
Lord I'm wishing I was back in Tennessee
Am
Way down in that old Columbus Stockade
   E7                                     Am
My friends all have turned their backs on me.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Dm                     Am
Go and leave me if you wish to
Dm                      E7
Never let me cross your mi-i -ind
        Am
In your heart you love another
E7                                Am
Leave me, little darling, I don't mind

[Verse 2]
 
Am
Many a night with you I've rambled
       E7                            Am
Honey, countless hours with you I've spent
Am
Thought I had your sweet love and your little heart forever
    E7                     Am
And now I find it was only lent.
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Dm                     Am
Go and leave me if you wish to
Dm                      E7
Never let me cross your mi-i -ind
        Am
In your heart you love another
E7                                Am
Leave me, little darling, I don't mind

[Verse 3]
 
Am
Last night as I lay sleeping
     E7                               Am
I am dreaming that I am lying in your arms
Am
When I awaken I was mistaken
      E7                                  Am
Lord, I was still right here behind these bars
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Dm                     Am
Go and leave me if you wish to
Dm                      E7
Never let me cross your mi-i -ind
        Am
In your heart you love another
E7                                Am
Leave me, little darling, I don't mind
 
 
[Outro]
 
E7                        Am6
Lord I've got the walking blues.
