Album: I'm A Woman
 
[Verse 1]
C                                             G7
He goes on the prowl each night like an Alley Cat,
Dm7  G7                                     C
Look-in' for some new delight like an Alley Cat.
C
You know, She can't trust him out of sight, 
                   G7
there's no dout of that.
Dm7 G7                                             C
He  just don't know wrong from right like an Alley Cat.
 
[Chorus]
   F            C            D7
He meets'em and loves'em and leaves'em
                G7
Like the Cat-sa nova does.
 
[Verse 2]
        C
I mean, That's no way to treat a pal, 
                    G7
she should tell him Scat!
Dm7    G7                                    C
Aren't you sorry for that gal with her Alley Cat?
 
[Instrumental]
C G7 Dm7 G7 C
 
[Chorus]
   F            C            D7
He meets'em and loves'em and leaves'em
                G7
Like the Cat-sa nova does.
 
[Verse 3]
        C
I mean, That's no way to treat a pal, 
                    G7
she should tell him Scat!
Dm7    G7                                    C
Aren't you sorry for that gal with her Alley Cat?
 
[Outro]
           F    F#dim
Yes it's a sad, sad, tail
     C             A7
Of a lonesome frail,
            F    F#dim
Ya that's a sad, sad tail
     C             A7
Of a lonesome frail,
D7      G7    C
And her Alley Cat.
