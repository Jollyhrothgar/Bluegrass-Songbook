[Intro]
D   D  C/D  D
 
[Verse 1]
D                                   C/D D
I know a guy who's tough but sweet 
D                               C/D D
He's so fine, he can't be beat 
D                                  C/D D
He's got everything that I desire 
D                            C/D D
Sets the summer sun on fire
 
[Chorus]
D      C   D    C/D D   D      C   D    C/D D
I want can-dy,          I want can-dy                      
 
[Verse 2]
D                                      C/D  D
Go to see him when the sun goes down 
D                             C/D  D
Ain't no finer boy in town
D                                           C/D  D
You're my guy, just what the doctor ordered
D                                   C/D  D
So sweet, you make my mouth water
 
[Chorus]
D      C   D    C/D D   D      C   D    C/D D
I want can-dy,          I want can-dy  
 
[Verse 3]
D                                            C/D D
Candy on the beach, there's nothing better 
D                                                C/D D
But I like candy when it's wrapped in a sweater
D                                   C/D D
Some day soon I'll make you mine, 
D                                   C/D D
Then I'll have candy all the time.
 
[Chorus]
D      C   D    C/D D   D      C   D    C/D D
I want can-dy,          I want can-dy
