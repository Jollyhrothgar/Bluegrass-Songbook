Intro: A E A A D E A 


         A                      E 
    'Tis true the rain that has no end, 
                              A 
    it's hard to find a faithful friend, 
                               D 
    and when you find one just and true, 
         E                       A 
    he's dropped the old one for the new. 

      A                     E 
Bring back my blue eyed boy to me, 
                            A 
bring back my blue eyed boy to me, 
                            D 
bring back my blue eyed boy to me, 
   E                A 
that I may ever happy be. 



        A                    E 
    Must I go bound and have no free, 
                                  A 
    must I love a boy that don't love me? 
                            D 
    Or must I act the childish part, 
        E                        A 
    and love that boy that broke my heart? 


      A                     E 
Bring back my blue eyed boy to me, 
                            A 
bring back my blue eyed boy to me, 
                            D 
bring back my blue eyed boy to me, 
   E                A 
that I may ever happy be. 

( A E A A D E A ) 

         A                   E 
    Last night my lover promised me 
                              A 
    to tak me across the deep blue sea, 
                               D 
    and now he's gone and left me alone, 
       E                   A 
    an orphan girl without a home. 

      A                     E 
Bring back my blue eyed boy to me, 
                            A 
bring back my blue eyed boy to me, 
                            D 
bring back my blue eyed boy to me, 
   E               A 
that I may ever happy be. 

      A                       E 
    O dig my grave, both wide and deep, 
                            A 
    place marble at my head and feet, 
                              D 
    and on my breast a snow white dove 
       E                                        A 
    to show to the world I died for love. 

      A                     E 
Bring back my blue eyed boy to me, 
                            A 
bring back my blue eyed boy to me, 
                            D 
bring back my blue eyed boy to me, 
   E                A 
that I may ever happy be.
