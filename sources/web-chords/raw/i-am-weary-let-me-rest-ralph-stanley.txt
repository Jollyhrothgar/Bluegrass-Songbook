[Intro]
D   D   D
 
[Chorus]
        D       G         D
Kiss me mother, kiss your darlin'
       D              A
Lay my head upon your breast
           D      G     D
Throw your loving arms around me
     D      A      D
I am weary, let me rest
 
[Verse 1]
          A                D
Seems the light is swiftly fading
         D                  A
Brighter scenes they do now show
     G               D
I am standing by the river
       D       A       D
Angels wait to take me home
 
[Chorus]
        D       G         D
Kiss me mother, kiss your darlin'
        D            A
See the pain upon my brow
           D       G        D
While I'll soon be with the angels
         D         A      D
Fate has doomed my future now
 
[Verse 2]
            A                   D
Through the years you've always loved me
       D                    A
And my life you've tried to save
        G               D
But now I shall slumber sweetly
     D        A      D
In a deep and lonely grave
 
[Chorus]
        D       G         D
Kiss me mother, kiss your darlin'
       D              A
Lay my head upon your breast
           D      G     D
Throw your loving arms around me
     D      A      D
I am weary, let me rest
     D      A      D
I am weary, let me rest
