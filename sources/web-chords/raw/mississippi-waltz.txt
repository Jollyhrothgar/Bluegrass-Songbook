Waltz of the Mississippi
John Hartford: Good Old Boys
Banjo tuned E, Capo 3, Key C

   C                  
On the old Mississippi
   F
Are girls in red dresses
    C                  
The one that's a beauty
       G7        C 
She's broken my heart


In the shade of the woods
We are dancing together
On the old Mississippi
We drifted apart


To dare to have loved
The girl of such rareness
So fair and so perfect
She's nature's fine art


    hide ad ⨯
    
        
    




On the old Mississippi
There's a girl of my vision
On the old Mississippi,
She has broken my heart
