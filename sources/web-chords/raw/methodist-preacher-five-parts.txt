E       Em       D
I could see them smile
          C     E  Em D C
Doused in gasoline
E       Em       D
  Offer up their child
        C        E     Em D C
As they burn and scream
             E          Em
My parents sold me to a preacher
      D               C
Now I miss my mom and dad
   E                  Em
I heard they joined a cult
                D       C
They say, mass suicidal death
    E                 G
I’m locked inside the church
             D               C
They say the prophecy’s foretold
E                Em
Strapped to the altar
         D           C     A
I’m the sacrifice the owe, Oooh
E                A
They’ll chase me through the graveyard
G            B
I hear their guns
E         A
I’ll hide behind the chapel
G              B
 Their out for blood
E                 A
They’ll call you brother
              G
Then They’ll turn around
      B           E
And chop off your hands
                 A
Can’t trust your mother
           G            B         E Em D C
Cause your father was a traveling man
               E             Em
Stone written tablets in the basements
      D                    C
Where authors etched their lies
        E             Em
They’ll sell you your forgiveness
       D                  C
If you pay them with your life
   E            Em
An actor in his mansion
        D                   C
Holds a party where they’ll meet
E                 Em
  Strapped to the table
        D               C      A
Let the holy have their feast Oooh
E                A
They’ll chase me through the graveyard
G             B
I hear their guns
E         A
I’ll hide behind the chapel
G             B
Their out for blood
E                A
They’ll call you brother
G
Then They’ll turn around and
B
 chop off your hands
E                A
Can’t trust your mother
           G            B
Cause your father was a traveling man
E              A
They’ll preach salvation
       G                  B
as they tie my limbs And rip out my teeth
E                   A                 G
They’ll soak their daggers In the pigs blood
             B
As I beg and I plead
