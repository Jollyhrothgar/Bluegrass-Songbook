Intro:D G D A D 


                      D                                 G           D 
    'Twas in the year of '92, in the merry month of June, 

    I left my mother and a home so dear 
                     A                                D      D G D A D 
    for the girl I loved on the Greenbriar shore. 

                     D                                                 G             D 
    My mother dear, she came to me and said "Oh son, don't go," 

    "Don't leave your mother and a home so dear 
                  A                             D        D G D A D 
    to trust a girl on the Greenbriar shore. " 

                    D                                                      G           D 
    But I was young and reckless, too, and I craved a reckless life, 

    I left my mother with a broken heart, 
                                A                D      D G D A D 
    and I choosed that girl to be my wife. 

                       D                                              G              D 
    Her hair was dark and curly, too and her loving eyes were blue, 

    her cheeks were like the red red rose, 
                 A                                D       D G D A D 
    the girl I loved on the Greenbriar shore. 

                            D                                                   G        D 
    The years rolled on and the months rolled by, she left me all alone, 

    now I remember what mother said : 
                       A                             D 
    Never trust a girl on the Greenbriar shore.
