Verse:1 
C                     Em         Am               Em  
All your life you've waited, for love to come and stay, 
    Dm              Am              F             G 
And now that I have found you, you must not slip away, 
   C               Em            Am                 Em  
I know it's hard believin', the words you've heard before, 
     Dm               Em                  Dm /F - G 
But darlin' you must trust them just once more. 
 
  
Chorus: 
  G7            C     Em            F      G 
'Cause baby goodbye, doesn't mean forever, 
                    C     Em                Dm /F 
Let me tell you goodbye, doesn't mean we'll never be together again, 
Am                 Em                F 
If you wake up and I'm not there, I won't be long away, 
            Am              Am /F               G7              C 
'Cause the things you do my Goodbye Girl, Will bring me back to you. 
 
 
Verse:2 
C                   Em     Am             Em  
I know you've been taken, afraid to hurt again, 
     Dm                 Am           F               G7 
You fight the love you feel for me instead of givin' in, 
    C            Em          Am            Em  
But I can wait forever, for helpin' you to see, 
    Dm               Em              Dm /F - G 
That I was meant for you and you for me. 
 
 
Chorus:2 
G7              C     Em           F      G 
So remember Goodbye doesn't mean forever, 
G7                  C     Em                 F 
Let me tell you goodbye, doesn't mean we'll never be together again, 
  Am                Em              F                  Fm  
Though we may be so far apart, you still will have my heart, 
    Am                   C/G                 F         F/G      C 
So forget your past my Goodbye Girl, 'Cause now you're home at last.
