Late Last Night
 
 
[Verse]
A
Well could you try to keep it down
A
I was up kinda late last night
A
Now i'm felling like i usually feel
                  E
After i feel alright
D
I don't wanna hear another word about mornin
A                D
I can't take the light
A
Well could you try to keep it down
E                       A
I was up kinda late last night
A
You see there is something inside
A
this world that's gone so wrong
A
there is a gap between the rich and the poor
E
a million miles long
D
I dig the fact that you and your friends are
A                           D
gonna stand up and make it right
A
But could you try to keep it down
E                       A
i was up kinda late last night
 
 
[Chorus]
D
i was down at the bar like the fool i am
A
dancing on the table to son of slam
D
i met a whole lot of people i still don't know
E
i just rolled in an hour ago
D
could you try to keep it down?
A
try to keep it down.
D                       E                       A
try to keep it down i was up kinda late last night
