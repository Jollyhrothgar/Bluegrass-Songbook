C                 F
The sun is slowly sinking 
 
    C      G7     C
The day is almost gone 
 
C                    F
Still darkness falls around us 
 
    C       G7      C
And we must journey on 
 
 
 
    F               C
The darkest hour is just before dawn
 
C                    G7
The narrow way leads home
 
    C                 F      C
Lay down your soul at Jesus' feet
 
C                   G7          C
The darkest hour is just before dawn
 
 
 
C                          F
Like a shepherd out on the mountain 
 
  C            G7           C
A watching the sheep down below
 
C                   F
He's coming back to claim us
 
     C      G7       C
Will you be ready to go
