C                                        G7
Well a hundred years from now I won't be crying
 
                                    C
A hundred years from now I won't be blue
 
                                 F
And my heart will have forgotten that you broke every vow
 
G7                                C
I won't care a hundred years from now
 
 
                                        G7
Lord it seems that it was yesterday you told me
 
                                      C
You couldn't live without my love somehow
 
                                F
Now that you're with another it breaks my heart somehow
 
G7                                C
I won't care a hundred years from now
 
 
C                                        G7
Well a hundred years from now I won't be crying
 
                                    C
A hundred years from now I won't be blue
 
                                 F
And my heart will have forgotten that you broke every vow
 
G7                                C
I won't care a hundred years from now
 
 
                                           G7
Now do you recall the night sweetheart you promised
 
                               C
Another's kiss you never would allow
 
                               F
That's all in the past dear it didn't seem to last
 
G7                                C
I won't care a hundred years from now
 
 
C                                        G7
Well a hundred years from now I won't be crying
 
                                    C
A hundred years from now I won't be blue
 
                                 F
And my heart will have forgotten that you broke every vow
 
G7                                C
I won't care a hundred years from now
