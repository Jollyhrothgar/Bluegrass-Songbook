[Intro]
E
 
[Verse 1]
N.C.                                                A
Took a Nine Eleven 'bout a hundred and seven down a back road
          B                                               E          B
Where the white river runs and the southern sun makes the kudzu grow
    E                                      A
And what I found in the Ozark mountains I ain't ever seen
   B                                                    E           B
It sure does feel like you're sittin' on the top of the world to me
 
 
[Chorus]
E                                         A
Gotta get down, gotta get down to Arkansas
       B                                           E               B
Havin' so much fun that it's probably a little bit against the law
        E                                                 A
All the boys and the girls down there sure do know how to have a ball
       B                                         B D A
If you wanna get down, gotta get down to Arkansas
 
 
[Verse 2]
         E                                                 A
Well, we burned through the one light towns likе a scalded dog
        B                                              E     B
When we lit out of Fayеtteville, they were callin' the hogs
          E                                 A
We made a pit stop in Little Rock for some barbecue
            B                                                   E     B
And when we hit West Memphis there were blue lights in our rear view
 
 
[Chorus]
E                                         A
Gotta get down, gotta get down to Arkansas
       B                                           E               B
Havin' so much fun that it's probably a little bit against the law
        E                                                 A
All the boys and the girls down there sure do know how to have a ball
       B                                         B D A
If you wanna get down, gotta get down to Arkansas

Gotta get down, gotta get down to Arkansas
       B                                           E               B
Havin' so much fun that it's probably a little bit against the law
        E                                                 A
All the boys and the girls down there sure do know how to have a ball

E                                         A
Gotta get down, gotta get down to Arkansas
       B                                           E               B
Havin' so much fun that it's probably a little bit against the law
        E                                                 A
All the boys and the girls down there sure do know how to have a ball
       B                                         B D A
If you wanna get down, gotta get down to Arkansas
