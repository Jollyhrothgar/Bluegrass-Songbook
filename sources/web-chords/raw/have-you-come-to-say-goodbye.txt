[Intro]
D G
 
 
[Verse 1]
                           C
As i gaze into your eyes tonight dear
                                     D
You act so cold and strange i wonder why?
G                            C
Can it be that you no longer want me?
D                                 G
Tell me, have you come to say goodbye?
 
 
[Chorus]
D                                G
Have you come to say goodbye, my darling?
A                                   D
Was the "i love you" promise just a lie?
G                        C
Why go on pretending any longer?
D                                 G
Tell me, have you come to say goodbye?

[Verse 2]
                                   C
You may forsake me but i'll always love you
                                D
And don't ever let you leave my mind
   G                               C
My life will never be the same without you
    D                                 G
But tell me, have you come to say goodbye?
 
 
[Chorus]
 
D                                G
Have you come to say goodbye, my darling?
A                                   D
Was the "i love you" promise just a lie?
G                        C
Why go on pretending any longer?
D                                 G
Tell me, have you come to say goodbye?

[Verse 3]
                                       C
The dreams of cheery soul will fade forever
                                  D
If tonight you've come to say goodbye
G                              C
Now i'm left alone with bitter heartache
D                                  G
Darling please don't blame me if i cry
 
 
[Outro]
 
D                                G
Have you come to say goodbye, my darling?
A                                   D
Was the "i love you" promise just a lie?
G                        C
Why go on pretending any longer?
D                                 G
Tell me, have you come to say goodbye?
