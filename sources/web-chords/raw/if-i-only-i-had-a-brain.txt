If I Only Had a Brain
 
 
        F                       Gm7                                           F
I could while away the hours conferrin' with the flowers, consultin' with the rain
       Gm7                             C7
And my head I'd be scratchin' while my thoughts were busy hatchin'
      F
If I only had a brain
       F                   Gm7                F
I'd unravel any riddle for any individ'le in trouble or in pain
 
 
[Dorothy]
 
         Gm7                                  C7
With the thoughts you'd be thinkin' you could be another Lincoln
       F
If you only had a brain
 
 
[Scarecrow]
 
    Bb               F       Gm7     C7       F
Oh, I would tell you why the ocean's near the shore
        Gm7      A7                   Dm
I could think of things I never thunk before
             G                  C7
And then I'd sit and think some more
 
        F                         Gm7                           F
I would not be just a nuffin', my head all full of stuffin', my heart all full of pain
        Gm7                            C7
I would dance and be merry, life would be a ding-a-derry
     F
If I only had a brain
