Bringing In The Georgia Mail
Flatt & Scruggs
 
[Verse]
A
See the engine puffing,
A
boy she's making time
A
That old trains wearing out the
E
rail, rail, rail
A
Heading for the mountain
A
that she's got to climb
A
Bringing in the
E       A
Georgia Mail
 
[Verse]
A
Ninety miles an hour
A
and she's gaining speed
A
Listen to the whistle moan and
E
wail, wail, wail
A
Has she got the power
A
I'll say yes indeed
A
Bringing in the
E       A
Georgia Mail
 
[Verse]
A
See the driver's travel
A
Watch her on the tracks
A
Ought to put that engineer in
E
jail, jail, jail
A
Has he got her rolling
A
Watch her ball the jack
A
Bringing in the
E       A
Georgia Mail
 
[Verse]
A
Rocking and a reeling
A
Spouting off the steam
A
Stoke the fire and hope the brakes don't
E
fail, fail, fail
A
Serving all the people
A
Listen to her scream
A
Bringing in the
A       E
Georgia Mail
 
[Verse]
A
See the engine puffing,
A
boy she's making time
A
That old trains wearing out the
E
rail, rail, rail
A
Heading for the mountain
A
that she's got to climb
A
Bringing in the
E       A
Georgia Mail
