[Verse]
Db
I don't want your millions, Mister
        Gb                Db
I don't want your diamond ring
      Gb                         Db
All I want is the right to live, Mister
        Ab          Db
Give me back my job again
 
[Verse 2]
Db
Now, I don't want your Rolls-Royce, Mister
        Gb                 Db
I don't want your pleasure yacht
      Gb                      Db
All I want's just food for my babies
        Ab            Db
Give to me my old job back
 
[Verse 3]
Db
We worked to build this country, Mister
          Db                Gb
While you enjoyed a life of ease
              Db                 Gb
You've stolen all that we built, Mister
         Ab                 Db
Now our children starve and freeze
 
[Chorus]
Db
So, I don't want your millions, Mister
        Gb                Db
I don't want your diamond ring
      Gb                         Db
All I want is the right to live, Mister
        Ab           Db
Give me back my job again
 
[Verse 4]
Db
Think me dumb if you wish, Mister
         Gb                Db
Call me green, or blue, or red
         Gb                 Db
This one thing I sure know, Mister
          Ab             Db
My hungry babies must be fed
 
[Verse 5]
Db
Take the two old parties, Mister
   Db                         Gb
No difference in them I can see
           Db            Gb
But with a Farmer-Labor Party
         Ab             Db
We could set the people free
 
[Chorus]
Db
So, I don't want your millions, Mister
        Gb                Db
I don't want your diamond ring
      Gb                         Db
All I want is the right to live, Mister
        Ab           Db
Give me back my job again
