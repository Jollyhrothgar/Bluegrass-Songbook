[Verse 1]
 
D                  A         G                 D
  It was good one time, everything was mighty fine
     D             A             D
The coal tipples roared day and night
     D              A            G             D
But things they got slow for no reason that I know
         D              A         D
And the ill winds they hove into sight
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
         D                A         G          D
Now the mines all closed down, everybody laid around
       D           A                  D
There wasn't very much that you could do
        D            A                G                D
Except stand in the line to get your ration script on time
     D             A             D
And woman I could see it killin' you
 
 
[Chorus]
 
         D                  A   D
Now the soft new snows of December
        Bm  G           D
Lightly fall my cabin 'round
         D                   G
And the last train from Poor Valley
        D    G      A     G        D
Takin' brown haired Becky Richmond bound
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
D                A               G            D
It's been comin' on, I knew you soon would be gone
D                     A          D
Leavin' crossed your mind every day
D                A             G               D
Then you said to me things are bad at home you see
  D                A        D
I think I'd better be on my way
 
 
[Verse 4]
 
D                   A      G              D
I should blame you now, I never could somehow
      D                 A                 D
For a miner's wife you weren't cut out to be
         D                A                  G                 D
Well, it wasn't what you thought, just some dreams that you'd bought
         D                  A             D
When you left your home and ran away with me
 
 
[Chorus]
 
         D                  A   D
Now the soft new snows of December
        Bm  G           D
Lightly fall my cabin 'round
         D                   G
And the last train from Poor Valley
        D    G      A     G        D
Takin' brown haired Becky Richmond bound
 
 
[Chorus]
 
         D                  A   D
Now the soft new snows of December
        Bm  G           D
Lightly fall my cabin 'round
         D                   G
And the last train from Poor Valley
        D    G      A     G        D
Takin' brown haired Becky Richmond bound
 
         D                   G
And the last train from Poor Valley
        D    G      A     G        D
Takin' brown haired Becky Richmond bound
