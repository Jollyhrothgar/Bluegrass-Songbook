[Intro]
Em G Em C G
 
[Verse 1]
G                                          Em
In the old Kentucky Mountain so many years ago
G
Around the old log cabin
                         Em
Where the wild red roses grow
 C                        G
(Where the wild red roses grow)
 
[Verse 2]
G                                                        Em
There's laurel on the mountainside and bluegrass in the field
G
Bluebirds singin' all day long,
                        Em
in heaven is the way I feel
C                       G
(In heaven is the way I feel)
 
[Verse 3]
G                                                      Em
The whipper wools are singin', they're wide-eyed until dawn
G
'Round the old log cabin
                   Em
That used to be my home
C                   G
(That used to be my home)
 
[Verse 4]
G                                              Em
At daybreak in the mornin', then I'll be on my way
G
I'm headed for the mountains
                  Em
I'm goin' back to stay
C                  G
(I'm goin' back to stay)
 
[Verse 5]
G                                                   Em
Now mom and dad have passed away there's no one left around
G
And the old log cabin
                   Em
Has almost tumbled down
C                   G
(Has almost tumbled down)
