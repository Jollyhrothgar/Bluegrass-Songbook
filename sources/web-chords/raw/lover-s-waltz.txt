[Intro]
A
 
[Verse 1]
A                            Amaj7
Do you wanna dance, will you wear my ring
A                                    D
Will you lay with me until the final bullets sing
         Bm              E
Over our heads, over our heads
      D                   E             A
In a lovers' waltz we'll turn until the end
 
[Verse 2]
A                            Amaj7
Will you marry me, don't you wanna spin
A                                    D
Will you run with me until the ground folds us within
         Bm              E
Over our heads, over our heads
      D                   E             A
In a lovers' waltz we'll turn until the end
 
[Verse 3]
A                            Amaj7
And your shipwreck eyes, they sing to me
A                                    D
As we ride a killer whale across a diamond sea
         Bm              E
Over our heads, over our heads
      D                   E             A
In a lovers' waltz we'll turn until the end

D E A
 
[Verse 4]
(single strum)
A                            Amaj7
And I will hang for you, and you will hang for me
A                                    D
And the northern lights will take us in like refugees
         Bm              E
Over our heads, over our heads
      D                   E             A
In a lovers' waltz we'll turn until the end
