[Intro]
C  F  C
 
[Verse]
C                   F G                    C
High up on a mountain at a place called Calvary
                       F       G                    C
Stood three old wooden crosses for a Savior and two thieves
C                   F      G                  C
And we all know the reason the two men had to die
                   F      G                    C
But the man in the middle was there for you and I
 
[Chorus]
                               F    G                C
And the man in the Man in the middle was no ordinary man
                         F                              G
Cause He could make the blind see with one touch of His hand
        Em           C                             F
And the sound of His voice brought Lazerus back to life
                   C          G                C
And the man in the middle was there for you and I
 
[Verse]
C                  F     G                   C
All the wonders of Heaven have to bow at His command
                                    F                        G
And all the things that lie beneath Him were made by His two hands
         Em         C                       F
And some where in a nursery a new born baby cries
                   C                 G        C
And the Man in the middle is the giver of life
 
[Chorus]
                               F    G                C
And the man in the Man in the middle was no ordinary man
                         F                              G
Cause He could make the blind see with one touch of His hand
        Em           C                             F
And the sound of His voice brought Lazerus back to life
                   C          G                C
And the man in the middle was there for you and I
                    C         G                F     C
Yes the Man in the middle is there for you and I
 
                         C                G         C
Be cause the man in the middle is the giver of life
 
[Chorus]
                               F    G                C
And the man in the Man in the middle was no ordinary man
                         F                              G
Cause He could make the blind see with one touch of His hand
        Em           C                             F
And the sound of His voice brought Lazerus back to life
                   C          G                C
And the man in the middle was there for you and I
