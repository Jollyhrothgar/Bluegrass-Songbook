[Verse]
 
       Am
Let me hold you
        C
For the last time
         F
It's the last chance to feel again
        Am
But you broke me
      C             F      Dm
Now I can't feel anything
       Am
When I love you,
        C
It's so untrue
  F
I can't even convince myself
         Am
When I'm speaking,
         C                F    Dm
It's the voice of someone else
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
      F     G  Am
Oh it tears me up
  F           G          Em
I try to hold on, but it hurts too much
  F         G              Em             F              C
I try to forgive, but it's not enough to make it all okay
 
 
[Chorus]
 
          Dm             Am
You can't play on broken strings
          C       G
You can't feel anything 
          Dm                  Am
That your heart don't want to feel
        C                             G
I can't tell you something that ain't real
       F
Oh the truth hurts
    Am
And lies worse
C                 G
How can I give anymore
       Dm                Am       G
When I love you a little less than before
 
 
[Verse]
 
        Am     C
Oh what are we doing
       F
We are turning into dust
        Am           C        F    Dm
Playing house in the ruins of us
        Am               C
Running back through the fire
             F
When there's nothing left to save
          Am               C                        F    Dm
It's like chasing the very last train when it's too late
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
      F     G  Am
Oh it tears me up
  F           G          Em
I try to hold on, but it hurts too much
  F         G              Em            F               C
I try to forgive, but it's not enough to make it all okay
 
 
[Chorus]
 
          Dm             Am
You can't play on broken strings
          C       G
You can't feel anything 
          Dm                  Am
That your heart don't want to feel
        C                             G
I can't tell you something that ain't real
       F
Oh the truth hurts
    Am
And lies worse
C                 G
How can I give anymore
       Dm                Am        G
When I love you a little less than before
 
 
[Bridge]
 
          F                   Am
But we're running through the fire
             C                F
When there's nothing left to save
          F                     Am
It's like chasing the very last train
        C                        Em
When we both know it's too late (too late)
 
 
[Chorus]
 
          Dm            Am
You can't play on broken strings
          C       G
You can't feel anything 
          Dm                 Am
That your heart don't want to feel
        C                             G
I can't tell you something that ain't real
       F
Well the truth hurts
    Am
And lies worse
C                 G
How can I give anymore
       Dm                Am       G
When I love you a little less than before
       Dm                Am         G
Oh when I love you a little less than before
 
 
[Outro]
 
       Am              C
Let me hold you for the last time
         F                   Dm
It's the last chance to feel again
