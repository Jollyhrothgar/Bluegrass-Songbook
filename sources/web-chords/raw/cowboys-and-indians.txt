Correct me on the lyrics. I can't find them anywhere.
 
 
Cowboys and Indians
by, Joshua James
 
 
Here's the little solo that he throws in occasionally:
 
E ---3p2--0-----------------------------------|
B ------------h3---0--------------------------|
G -----------------------0---2h4p2p0----0-----|
D --------------------------------------------|
A --------------------------------------------|
E --------------------------------------------|
 
 
		G			     D		G
Well let the indians ride and the cowboys drink
		G				D	   G
Let 'em drown themselves 'till they cannot see
	    G			  D                G
Let 'em shoot their guns towards the sky
		      G					D	     G
And when their god comes down they'll kneel and cry
 
		G			     D		  G
Well let the indians ride and the cowboys drink
	    G					D	   G
Let 'em drown themselves 'till they cannot see
	    G			   D 		    G
Let 'em shoot their guns towards the sky
			G				D	     G
And when their god comes down they'll kneel and cry
 
			     C			    D7		G
They'll say it wasn't me my Lord that shot the men
	      D					  G
It wasn't me my lord that burnt the land
	    C			   D7	    G
Look at me my lord, well here I stand
			 D
The Good Book in hand
				       G
It wasn't me it was a brown man
 
	     G				D	      G
Give the indians love and the cowboys death
		   G				     D		     G
Steal all their clothes, their food, take away their breath
		  G               D		G
Long lasting pain cannot supplement
	  G				      D		  G
All the deaths, hate, rape, and impoverishment
 
			    C			    D7		  G
They'll say it wasn't me my Lord that shot them down
			D				   G
And when they hit the dirt, I didn't hear a sound
		C				   D		G
Please take me my Lord, I should be heaven bound
		     D
[I'm white not brown?] x4
				  G        D G D G
I can't stand to hear the sound
 
Lord burn the church and burn the friar
Don't let the clouds move in, just let the flames grow higher
Lord [???] this earth and [make so much sense?]
But grant the righteous their recompense
 
It was all of us lord, we're to blame
Since [..... hands?] have been so unashamed
Leave our souls to burn down with the flames
Until we change, we haven't changed
Until we change, we'll never change
So like this we'll remain
 
Em	   C			    G
Let the cowboys burn the houses
Em	      C			     G
Let them burn them to the earth
Em		C		    G
Let those cowboys burn in ashes
			D
[Because they've hurt?] x3
 
It was all of us Lord, we're to blame
Since [..... hands?] have been so unashamed
Leave our souls to burn here in the flames
Until we change, we haven't changed
Until we change, we'll never change
And so like this we'll remain
