[Intro]
G    C     G    D   G   C    G   D   G
 
[Verse 1]
G              C
Went to see my gal last night
    G               D
She asked me in for supper
G                    C
Hooked my toe in the table cloth
    G        D           G
And stuck my nose in the butter
 
[Chorus]
G                 C
Bile them cabbage down
G                   D
Bake them hoe cakes brown
     G             C
The only song that I can sing is
G         D       G
Bile them cabbage down
 
[Verse 2]
G              C
When I went to see that girl
    G             D
She didnt know my route
    G             C
She put me in her coffee pot
    G         D       G
and poured me out the spout
 
[Verse 3]
  G                  C
I bought that girl a Model T
    G                  D
She learnt to drive it well
        G          C
But she run into a telephone pole
    G       D      G
and tore it all to pieces
 
[Chorus]
G                 C
Bile them cabbage down
G                   D
Bake them hoe cakes brown
     G             C
The only song that I can sing is
G         D       G
Bile them cabbage down
 
[Instrumental]
G    C     G    D   G   C    G   D   G
 
[Verse 4]
G                 C
When she sat down on my knee
G               D
It made me feel sneaky
  G                           C
I kissed her on the mouth and hit her nose
    G         D        G
And that darn thing is leakin'
 
[Chorus]
G                 C
Bile them cabbage down
G                   D
Bake them hoe cakes brown
     G             C
The only song that I can sing is
G         D       G
Bile them cabbage down
 
[Verse]
G                 C
When you see that girl o' mine
G               D
Tell her if you can
G                                   D         G
When she goes to make the cornbread wash them nasty hands
 
[Chorus]
G                 C
Bile them cabbage down
G                   D
Bake them hoe cakes brown
     G             C
The only song that I can sing is
G         D       G
Bile them cabbage down
