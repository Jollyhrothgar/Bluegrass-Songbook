[Intro]
 
C  G C
 
[Verse 1]
 
C
I remember very well
C
On one dark and dreary day
C
Just as I was leavin' home
      G               C
For a distant land to roam
 
[Chorus]
 
C
Mother said (mother said)
C
My dear boy (my dear boy)
                             G
I hope to see you next year again
         Am   F         C
Fare you well (fare you well)
C
So I left my dear old home
      G               C
For a distant land to roam
 
[Verse 2]
 
C
Now I’ve wandered far away
C
From my home I’ve gone astray
C
But I’ll soon be coming home
      G                 C
Never more from thee to roam
 
[Chorus]
 
C
Mother said (mother said)
C
My dear boy (my dear boy)
                             G
I hope to see you next year again
         Am   F         C
Fare you well (fare you well)
C
So I left my dear old home
      G               C
For a distant land to roam
 
[Verse 3]
 
C
Well these words she said to me
C
As she took me by the hand
C
If on Earth we meet no more
      G                   C
We’ll meet at God’s right hand
 
[Chorus]
 
C
Mother said (mother said)
C
My dear boy (my dear boy)
                             G
I hope to see you next year again
         Am   F         C
Fare you well (fare you well)
C
So I left my dear old home
      G               C
For a distant land to roam
