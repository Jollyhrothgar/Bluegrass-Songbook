[Intro]
Dm  Bbsus2  F  C
 
[Verse]
Dm                Bbsus2
   I tried to be perfect
                  F
But nothing was worth it
         C                  Dm
I don't believe it makes me real
                   Bbsus2
I thought it'd be easy
              F
But no one believes me
        C                  Bbsus2
I meant all the things I said
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                           F
If you believe it's in my soul
        C                      Bbsus2
I'd say all the words that I know
                          F
Just to see if it would show
          C                  Bbsus2
That I'm trying to let you know
N.C.
That I'm better off on my own
 
[Instrumental]
Dm  Bbsus2  F  C
 
[Verse]
 
Dm                 Bbsus2
  This place is so empty
                    F
My thoughts are so tempting
               C            Dm
I don't know how it got so bad
                    Bbsus2
Sometimes it's so crazy
                  F
That nothing can save me
             C                  Bbsus2
But it's the only thing that I have
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                           F
If you believe it's in my soul
        C                      Bbsus2
I'd say all the words that I know
                          F
Just to see if it would show
          C                  Bbsus2
That I'm trying to let you know
N.C.                      F
That I'm better off on my own
 
 
 
[Bridge]
Bb F Bbsus2 Dm C Bbsus2 F Dm C Bbsus2 F A
 
 
[Verse]
 
Dm                Bbsus2
  I tried to be perfect
                F
It just wasn't worth it
               C           Dm
Nothing could ever be so wrong
                Bbsus2
It's hard to believe me
               F
It never gets easy
            C             Bbsus2
I guess I knew that all along
 
 
[Chorus]
                           F
If you believe it's in my soul
        C                      Bbsus2
I'd say all the words that I know
                          F
Just to see if it would show
          C                  Bbsus2
That I'm trying to let you know
N.C.                      F
That I'm better off on my own
