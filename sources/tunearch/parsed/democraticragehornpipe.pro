B:”Melodist: A Collection of music in two volumes" (1826-1859, No. 12, p. 9)
N:The melodist is a musician's ms., probably by a fiddler, that contains both
N:tunes and songs from a variety of sources, American and European. The
N:inscription on the inside cover reads, "This is from the Bridge family of
N:Augusta, Maine (Horatio Bridge, friend of Hawthorne's)". However, entries in
N:the ms. were in different hands indicating several contributors.
N:The ms. is neat and the notation studied and precise.
