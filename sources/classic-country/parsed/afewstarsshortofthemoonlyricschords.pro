[A#7]I'm not [F]pretending to be [C]something that I'm not
But [Dm]you don't have to be [Am]perfect to [A#7]give love all you've [G7]got

[C]If I fall a few stars short  of the [F]moon  
Would you still want [G7]me
[C]Or should I find a mountain I can't [F]move  
Would you still love [G7]me
I [F]could promise you the [G7]world 
But would it [C]change the way you feel girl
If you [F]knew  I [G7]might fall a few stars short of the [C]moon
{end_of_verse}

[A#7]You may be [F]thinking there's [C]nothing I can't do
But [Dm]I'm doing all I can [Am]and still [A#7]can't get enough of [G7]you
[Am]But you deserve the [G7]universe in the [C]palm of your hand
[Dm]Girl you chose to give your [Em]heart to this [F]ordinary [G7]man
