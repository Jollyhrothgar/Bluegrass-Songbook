{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I've been thinkin' of you
[F]And my heart [C]aches 
Till [F]I can't clear my head
And my thoughts won't [C]rise above you
[F]And I've had all I can [C]take
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
There's no more heart to [G7]break
Though I always get it [A]wrong
Gonna have to sing [F]along
With the familiar drinkin' [C]song
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Whiskey [A]bottle with some melody
[F]Just rolls of the tongue for me I [C]know 'em all
[A]When I mix gin and misery
I [F]know I'll be the last to see me when I [G7]fall
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
So I'm [C]thinkin' of you 
[F]But I don't feel the [C]pain
[F]The song went to my head 
Where I can't [C]forget to love you
[F]And I'll probably go [C]insane 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
About that old [G7]refrain
Though my heart is not that [A]strong
It keeps beating right [F]along 
With the familiar drinkin' [C]song
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Whiskey [A]bottle with some melody
[F]Just rolls of the tongue for me I [C]know 'em all
[A]When I mix gin and misery
I [F]know I'll be the last to see me when I [G7]fall
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Whiskey [A]bottle with some melody
[F]Just rolls of the tongue for me I [C]know 'em all
[A]When I mix gin and misery
I [F]know I'll be the last to see me when I [G7]fall
And I have to crawl
