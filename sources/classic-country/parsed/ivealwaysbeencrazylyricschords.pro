{meta: title I've Always Been Crazy}
{meta: artist Waylon Jennings}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I've always been crazy and the trouble that it's put me through
I've been busted for things that I did and I didn't [C]do
I can't say I'm proud of all of the things that [D7]I've done
But I can say I've never intentionally hurt [G]anyone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I've always been different with one foot over the line
Winding up somewhere one step ahead or [C]behind
It ain't been so easy but I guess [D7]I shouldn't complain
I've always been crazy but it's kept me from going [G]insane
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Beautiful lady are you sure that you [D7]understand
The chances your taking loving a free living [G]man
Are you really sure you really want what you [D7]see
Be careful of something that's just what you want it to [G]be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I've always been crazy but it's kept me from going insane
Nobody knows if it's something to bless or to [C]blame
So far I ain't found a rhyme [D7]or a reason to change
I've always been crazy but it's kept me from going [G]insane
{end_of_verse}
