[C]The Mayor gave me the [F]key to the [C]city
The welcome [Am]wagon had [D7]already [G7]appeared

For it's [C]plain now that [F]you once lived [C]here

It may be that I'll [F]never for[C]get you
Cause your [Am]love and [D7]love lives every[G7]where
[C]Could it be that I'll [F]always be [C]saying [Am]
I've gotta [C]go now for [F]you once lived [C]here

I see your [G7]face in the cool of the [C]evening
I hear your [G7]voice in each breeze loud and [F]clear

But not [C]this one cause [F]you once lived [C]here
No not this one cause [F]you once lived [C]here
