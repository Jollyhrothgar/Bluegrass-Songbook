{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Every town has it's ups and [C]downs 
Sometimes [G]ups outnumber the [D7]downs 
But not in Notting[G]ham 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I'm inclined to [C]believe if we were so [G]down 
We'd up and [C]leave 
We'd up and [D7]fly if we had wings for flying
[C]Can't you see the tears we're crying
[D7]Can't there be some happiness for me
But not in Notting[G]ham 
{end_of_verse}
