{meta: title A House of Gold}
{meta: artist Hank Williams}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]People steal they [F]cheat and [C]lie
For wealth and what it will [G7]buy
But don't they [F]know on the judgment [C]day
That Gold and [G7]Silver will melt a [C]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I'd rather be in a deep [F]dark [C]grave
And to know that my poor soul was [G7]saved
Than to live in this [F]world in a house of [C]Gold
And deny my [G7]God and doom my [C]soul
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
What good is Gold [F]and Silver [C]too
If your heart's not pure and [G7]true
Sinner hear me [F]w-hen I [C]say
Fall down on your [G7]knees and [C]pray
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
My Jesus died [F]on [C]Calvary 
He paid the cost that was charged to [G7]me
But if silver and [F]gold I never [C]own
Thank God one [G7]day I'll have a golden [C]home
{end_of_verse}
