[G]I feel tears welling up cold and deep inside
Like my [C]heart's sprung a big [G]break
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And a stab of loneliness sharp and painful
[A7]That I may never [D7]shake

You might say that I was taking [G]it hard
Oh  she [C]wrote me off with a [G]call

But don't you wager that I'll hide the sorrow
When I [D7]may break right down and [G]bawl

Well the race is on and here comes Pride up the backstretch
[C]Heartaches are going to the [G]inside

My Tears are holding back
[A7]They're trying not to [D7]fall
{end_of_verse}

True Love's [C]scratched for another's [G]sake

The race is on and it looks like Heartaches
And the [D7]winner loses [G]all
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 9}
One day I ventured in love never once suspecting
What the [C]final result would [G]be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 10}
How I lived in fear of waking up each morning
[A7]And thinking that you're gone from [D7]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 11}
There's ache and pain in my [G]heart
For today was [C]the one that I hated to [G]face

{start_of_verse: Verse 12}
Somebody new came up to win her
I came [D7]out in second [G]place
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
You might say that I was taking [G]it hard
Oh  she [C]wrote me off with a [G]call
{end_of_verse}
