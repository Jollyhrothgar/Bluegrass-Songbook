{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
spoken:
[C]I dedicate this song to the working man
For every man that puts in a hard
Eight or ten hours a day of work and toil and sweat
Always got somebody looking down his neck
Trying to get more out of 'em
Than he really ought to have to put in
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]After twenty nine long years of working in this shop
With Oney standing over [D7]me
Today [G7]when that old whistle blows
I'll check in all my gear and I'll re[C]tire
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The superintendent just stopped by
And said they planned my little get-to[D7]gether
And [G7]then he said I'd never have made it
If old Oney hadn't of held me to the [C]fire
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I've seen him in my dreams at night
And woke up in the morning feeling [D7]tired
And old [G7]Oney don't remember when I came here
How he tried to get me [C]fired
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
With his folded hands behind him
Every morning Oney waited at the [D7]gate
Where he'd [G7]rant and rave like I committed murder
Clocking in five minutes [C]late
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
But today they'll gather 'round me
Like I've seen 'em do when any man r[D7]etires
And old [G7]Oney's gonna tell me
From now on I'm free to do what I [C]desire
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
He'll present me with that little old gold watch
They give a man a times like [D7]this
But there's [G7]one thing he's not counting on
Today's the day I give old Oney [C]his   
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
I've been working building muscles
Oney's just been standing around and getting [D7]soft
And t[G7]oday about 4:30 I'll make up for every
Good night's sleep I've l[C]ost  
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 9}
When I'm gone I'll be remembered
As the working man that put his point [D7]across
With a [G7]right hand full of knuckles
Today's the day I show old Oney who's the [C]boss
Spoken:
Hmmmm  what time is it
Four thirty   hey Oney 
Oney ha ha ha ha
{end_of_verse}
