{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]There's no time to kill between the cradle and the grave
Father time still takes a toll on every minute that you save
Legal [F]tender's never gonna change the number of your days
The [C]highest cost of livin's dyin' that's one everybody pays
So have it spent before you get the [G7]bill there's no time to [C]kill
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
If we'd known ten years ago today would be ten years from now
Would we spend tomorrow's yesterday and make it last somehow
Or [F]lead the cheers in someone else's game and never learn to play
And see the [C]rules of thumb are all the same that measure every day
The grass is green on both sides of the [G7]hill there's no time to [C]kill
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
No time to [F]kill even I've said it and probably always will
But I can look ahead and see that time ain't standin' still
No time to [C]kill but time to change the kind of hurry I've been in
Quit this [F]work and worry lookin' [C]back at where I've been
If you don't look ahead nobody [G7]will there's no time to [C]kill
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
If we had an hourglass to watch each one go by
Or a bell to mark each one to pass we'd just see what they fly
Would we [F]escalate the value to the worth its weight in gold
Or would we [C]never know the fortunes that we have till we grow old
And do we just keep killin' time [G7]until there's no time to [C]kill
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
No time to [F]kill even I've said it and probably always will
But I can look ahead and see that time ain't standin' still
No time to [C]kill but time to change the kind of hurry I've been in
Quit this [F]work and worry lookin' [C]back at where I've been
If you don't look ahead nobody [G7]will there's no time to [C]kill
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
No time to [F]kill even I've said it and probably always will
But I can look ahead and see that time ain't standin' still
No time to [C]kill but time to change the kind of hurry I've been in
Quit this [F]work and worry lookin' [C]back at where I've been
If you don't look ahead nobody [G7]will there's no time to [C]kill
{end_of_verse}
