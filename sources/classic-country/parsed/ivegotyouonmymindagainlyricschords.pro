[G]I've got you [D7]on my mind [G]again
[C]You've been there since [D7]I don't know [G]when

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But [G]that same old [D7]hurt is back once [G]more
It's [C]hurt since you walked [D7]out the [G]door
And [C]as the long day ends and the [G]lonely night [E7]begins
I've [A7]got you [D7]on my mind [G]again

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well I said that you'd be [C]outta mind [G]when you got out of sight
That [D7]there'd never be one lonely moment [C]or one sleepless [G]night
But lately I've been [C]finding out just [G]what a heartache [E7]means
For [A7]every time I close my eyes I see [D7]you in my dreams
