{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[D7]One [G]night I went to [F]town and met a [C]girl from [G]Alabama
In her eyes I [F]saw the sadness [C]she had seen in [D7]life
I [G]found out she had [F]spent some wasted [C]years in [G]Chicago
She had known a hundred [F]men or more [C]but never as a [D7]wife
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
She was [G]going home to [C]start her life [G]again in Alabama
Where she had been and [C]why God only [D7]knows
But I [G]love that girl and [C]begged her just to [G]stay with me in Nashville
And I call that girl my [F]Ala[C]bama [G]Rose
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The days turned into [F]weeks and I was [C]sure she'd learn to [G]love me
But sometimes late at [F]night I'd wake and [C]listen to her [D7]cry
The [G]sun came up one [F]morning and my [C]Rose was not be[G]side me
I got that feeling [F]like you [C]want to [D7]die
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Now [G]I wonder if she [C]ever made it [G]back to Alabama
Where she is and [C]why God only [D7]knows
But [G]she must know no [C]matter where she [G]goes my dreams go with her
Cause I still love my [F]Ala[C]bama [G]Rose
God knows I love my [F]Ala[C]bama [G]Rose
{end_of_verse}
