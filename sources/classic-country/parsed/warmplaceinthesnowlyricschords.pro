[G7]There's a [C]chilling wind [D7]right outside my [G7]window
But I [C]know this time this [F]heart of mine won't [Dm]feel the bitter [G7]cold
For the [F]first time I can feel a fire in[C]side me[G]
And I [C]think I've found a [G7]warm place in the [C]snow

In the [C7]distance I can [F]see a light a [C]shining
You're the [C7]shelter where this [F]lonely heart can [G7]go
And a [C]home for all these [C7]feelings I've been [F]hiding[G]
Oh I [C]think I've found a [G7]warm place in the [C]snow

[G7]It's an [C]empty lonesome [D7]road I leave be[G7]hind me
And the [C]love I see in [F]front of me just [Dm]needs a place to [G7]grow
I'm going [F]where the cold will never [C]find me [G]
Oh I [C]think I've found a [G7]warm place in the [C]snow
