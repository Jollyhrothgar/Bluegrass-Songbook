{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]He said I know this ain't the time or place but [Am]Lord I need to [A7]talk
In a [C]business suit in a corner booth in a [G]crowded little restaurant
We all tried not to listen we [A7]all tried not to look
But a [C]whole room full of customers and the [D7]waitress and the cook
All [Em]stopped what we were [C]doin' when he bowed his [G]head
In that [Em]silence we heard [C]every word he [D7]said
{end_of_verse}

I've been [G]tryin' to do things [C]my way down [D7]here on life's [G]highway
[C]Slippin' slidin' [G]sideways tween [D7]no way and nowhere
If I could [G]only gain a foot[C]hold up [D7]there on your high [Em]road
[D7]Lord if [C]you hear me [G]help me I'll do [C]anything you [G]tell me to
[C]All I've got to [G]offer you is this [D7]backslider's [G]prayer

Well the waitress made the first move when she [Am]filled his coffee [A7]cup
She [C]said you ain't alone here mister you're [G]speakin' for the rest of us
I heard some scattered amens and a [A7]couple of I've been there's
Then [C]things got back to normal the [D7]dishes and the silverware
Were [Em]clangin' in the [C]kitchen like an angel's [G]band
As I [Em]took my place in [C]line to shake his [D7]hand
