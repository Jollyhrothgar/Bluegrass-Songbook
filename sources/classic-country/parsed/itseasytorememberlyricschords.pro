{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]It's so easy to re[C]member
Sweet con[G]tentment that we once [A7]knew [D7]
It's so [G]easy to re[C]member
Cause your [G]memory [D7]are only [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]Even though your memory brings a heart[G]ache
In my heart I [A7]know I don't re[D7]gret
It's so [G]easy to re[C]member
But it's [G]so hard [D7]to for[G]get
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Only let me keep a [C]memory
Of you [G]always within my [A7]heart[D7]
Even [G]though you love [C]another
From your [G]memories [D7]don't make me [G]hard
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]Maybe time will help me to for[G]get you
Maybe I'll find [A7]someone else to [D7]care
It's so [G]easy to re[C]member 
And it's [G]so hard [D7]to for[G]get
{end_of_verse}
