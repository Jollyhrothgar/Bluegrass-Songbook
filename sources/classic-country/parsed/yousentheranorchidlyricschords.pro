{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]You said you'd forget her you tried I [C]suppose
But you sent her an [G]Orchid  you sent me a [D7]Rose
I'm plain as the [G]sunshine she wears fancy [C]clothes
So you sent her an [G]Orchid  [D7]you sent me a [G]Rose
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The [C]thing that really breaks my heart is finding out you [G]lied
If [C]you'd been honest at the start I [G]would have stepped [D7]aside
You think it's a [G]secret but everyone [C]knows
That you sent her an [G]Orchid  [D7]you sent me a [G]Rose
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
It [C]wasn't bad enough to cheat and run around on [G]me
You [C]had to go and add the insult [G]to the [D7]injury
Go buy her some [G]diamonds for her fancy [C]clothes
Then send her an [G]Orchid  and [D7]give her this [G]Rose
{end_of_verse}
