{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]In the spotlight with my [F]shadow and my [G7]guitar on my [C]knees
[F]People in the smoke filled room all look the same to [G7]me
Though I [C]saw her in the [F]corner when I [G7]stood up and I [C]bowed
Ain't if [F]funny how they always seem to [G7]stand out in the [C]crowd

Her [F]soft eyes work their [C]magic and I [D7]felt the chemis[G7]try 
Then [F]all at once I [G7]realized this [F]trap surrounding [C]me
[F]Here I am in love again and [C]I'm not free to be[F]
([G7]I'm not free to [C]be)

When I autographed her [F]program she [G7]kissed me on the [C]cheek
I [F]fought with my composer thinking words I couldn't [G7]speak

If you [F]ever change your mind sometime [G7]remember me and [C]you
