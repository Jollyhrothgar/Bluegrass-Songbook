{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Breaking the rules 
[C]Every time I hug and kiss you [G]darling
While you wear another's [D7]name
If you're [G]breaking the rules 
In [C]any kind of game you're playing [G]reckless
And taking [D7]chances just the [G]same
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]Can it be a sin to love you [G]like I do
[A7]And we'd just be called a pair of [D7]fools
[G]If it's so wrong to [C]want to be with you my [G]darling
Then I guess [D7]I'll go on breaking [G]rules
{end_of_verse}

Then I guess [D7]I'll go on breaking [G]rules
