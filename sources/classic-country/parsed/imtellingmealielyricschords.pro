[C]Well these memories of mine don't seem to [G7]know you're gone

When we [F]went our separate ways the bottle [C]helped me through the days

And then I [G7]know my dear I'm telling me a [C]lie

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Found myself call out your name although [G7]you're not around
And talking to these shadows have [C]got me down

Cause I [G7]know my dear I'm telling me a [C]lie
