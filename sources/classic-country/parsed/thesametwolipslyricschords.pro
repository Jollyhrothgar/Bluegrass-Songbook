[C]The same two lips that once told me they loved [F]me
Are the [C]same two lips that now tell me [G7]goodbye
And the [C]same two hands that once held mine so [F]tightly
Are the [C]same two hands that now [G7]push me [C]aside
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The [G7]same two eyes that looked at me so [C]fondly
Are the [D7]same two eyes that look at someone [G7]else
And the [C]same two lips I've taught to say I love [F]you 
Now [C]teach I love you to [G7]somebody [C]else
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
They say that time will change us all [F]completely
And I [C]guess that we're no different me and [G7]you
Well there [C]was a time we got along so [F]sweetly
But that [C]old feelings gone and [G7]there's nothing we can [C]do
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
The [G7]same two arms that once held me so [C]tightly

Now [C]teach I love you to [G7]somebody [C]else
