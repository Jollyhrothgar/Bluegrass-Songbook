The [C]smile on your [G7]face lets me know [F]that you need [G7]me
There's a [C]truth in your eyes [G7]saying you'll [F]never leave [G7]me
A [C]touch of your [G7]hand says you'll [F]catch me if ever I [F][G7]f-all
[C]Now you [F]say it best [G7]when you say nothing at [C]all

[C]What's [G7]being said [F]between your heart and [G7]mine
