{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I can feel  a cold [G7]chill  coming [C]on me

But I don't [F]worry cause I know the Lord will [C]guide me
And direct me  [G7]in His perfect [C]time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
It's no secret [G7]that I battle with the [C]devil
He seduced me with [G7]all his cheap filled [C]charm
I was [F]hungry for what pleasure he [C]could give me
I was dieing  [G7]till I found my Savior's [C]arms
{end_of_verse}

[F]Now I'm [C]living in the [F]arms of my [C]Savior
[F]All the [C]worries I used to have are [G7]gone

[C]And He under[F]stands that I'm not [C]perfect
I'm just [G7]doing the best I [C]can

[C]And He under[F]stands that I'm not [C]perfect
I'm just [G7]doing the best I [F]c--[C]an
