{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[D7]In my [G]memo[D7]ry I will [C]always [G]see 
The [C]town that [G]I have loved so [D7]well
Where our [G]school played [D7]ball by the [C]gas yard [G]wall
And we [C]laughed through the [G]smoke [D7]and the [G]smell
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Going [C]home in the [D7]rain running [G]up the dark [Em]lane
Past the [C]jail and [Am]down behind the [D7]fountain
Those were [G]happy [D7]days in so [C]many many [G]ways
In the [C]town I [G]loved [D7]so [G]well
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
In the early [D7]morning the [C]shirt-factory [G]horn
Called [C]women from [G]Craigeen the Moor and the [D7]Bog
While the [G]man on the [D7]dole played the [C]mother's [G]role
Fed the [C]children and [G]then [D7]trained the [G]dogs
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
And when [C]times got [D7]tough there was [G]just about [Em]enough
But they [C]saw it [Am]through without com[D7]plaining
For [G]deep in[D7]side was a [C]burning [G]pride
In the [C]town I [G]loved [D7]so [G]well
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
There was music [D7]there in the [C]Derry [G]air
Like a [C]language that we could [G]all under[D7]stand
I [G]remember the [D7]day when I [C]earned my first [G]pay
When I [C]played in the [G]small [D7]pick-up [G]band
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
There I [C]spent my [D7]youth and to [G]tell [D7]you the [Em]truth
I was [C]sad to [Am]leave it all be[D7]hind me
For I'd [G]learned about [D7]life and I've [C]found a [G]wife
In the [C]town I [G]loved [D7]so [G]well
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
But when I re[D7]turned how my [C]eyes have [G]burned
To [C]see how a [G]town could be brought to its [D7]knees
By the [G]armored [D7]cars and the [C]bombed-out [G]bars
And the [C]gas that hangs [G]on to [D7]every [G]breeze
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
Now the [C]army's in[D7]stalled by that [G]old [D7]gas yard [Em]wall
And the [C]damned barbed [Am]wire gets higher and [D7]higher
With their [G]tanks and their [D7]guns oh my [C]God what have they [G]done
To the [C]town I [G]loved [D7]so [G]well
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 9}
Now the music's [D7]gone but they [C]carry [G]on
For their [C]spirit's been [G]bruised never bro[D7]ken
They will [G]not for[D7]get but their [C]hearts are a [G]set
On [C]tomorrow and [G]peace [D7]once [G]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 10}
For what's [C]done is [D7]done and what's [G]won [D7]is [Em]won
And what's [C]lost is [Am]lost and gone for[D7]ever
I can [G]only [D7]pray for a [C]bright brand new [G]day
In the [C]town I [G]loved [D7]so [G]well
{end_of_verse}
