To help me [C]do the best I [G]can

For I need [C]thy light to guide me day and [G]night

Jesus hold my hand I [C]need thee every [G]hour
Through this pilgrim land [E7]protect me by [A7]thy [D7]power
[G]Hear my feeble plea oh [C]Lord look down on [G]me

Blessed [C]Jesus [D7]hold my [G]hand

Let me travel in the light divine that I may [C]see the blessed [G]way

When I wander through the valley dim toward the [C]setting of the [G]sun

[G]I have put my faith in thee [C]dear [G]Lord 
That I may [C]reach the golden [G]strand

Blessed [C]Jesus [D7]hold my [G]hand
