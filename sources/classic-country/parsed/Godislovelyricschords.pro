{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Those folks who say that God is dead [C7]must see through vision [F]dim
By vain desires and [C]worldly sin and God is dead to [G7]them
[C]But my eyes searched as did my soul [C7]till I could plainly [F]see
His crowning glory all [C]around no [G7]God's not dead to [C]me [C7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]He lives in purple mountain tops [C]in valleys so serene
I [F]hear Him in a robin's song and [D7]in a rippling [G7]stream
[C]He lives in great majestic pines [C7]that reach the clouds [F]above
He's in the smile of a [C]little child [G7]oh truly God is [C]love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The beauty of a blushing rose [C7]His gracious touch has [F]shown
And by His hand the [C]velvet sky with tiny gems was [G7]strewn
[C]A thousand ways His magic touch dis[C7]plays His works of [F]art
He has a dwelling [C]place with me [G7]He lives within my [C]heart[C7]
