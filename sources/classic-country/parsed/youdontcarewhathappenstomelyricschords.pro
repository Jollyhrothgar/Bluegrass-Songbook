[G]Darling I love you so and it's kind of hard to [C]know

I [C]wanted a true love that never would [G]die

Now the tears [G]dim my eyes every time I [C]realize
That [D7]you don't care what happens to [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Darling let's not pretend cause our love affair must [C]end
You [D7]don't care what happens to [G]me
Now I know in my heart that I only played a [C]part
Cause [D7]you don't care what happens to [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I'll try [C]and forget you and start life [G]anew
I [A7]know that you're glad to be [D7]free
Give me one [G]goodbye kiss cause we can't go on like [C]this
Oh [D7]you don't care what happens to [G]me
