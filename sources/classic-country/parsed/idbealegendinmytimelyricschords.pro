{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]If heartaches brought [F]fame 
In [G7]love's crazy [C]game
I'd be a [F]legend  [G7]in my [C]time
[G7]If they gave [C]gold statu[F]ettes 
For [G7]tears and re[C]grets
I'd be a [F]legend  [G7]in my [C]time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But they [E7]don't give awards 
And there's [A7]no praise or fame
For a [D7]heart that's been broken 
[G7]Over love that's in vain
If lone[C]liness meant world ac[F]claim 
Every[G7]one would know my [C]name
I'd be a [F]legend [G7]in my [C]time
{end_of_verse}
