{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Here's the thing about your [D7]memory
It could [Em]be a thousand miles 
It could [D7]be as many [C]days[G]
But when it's sweeping [D7]over me
[Em]I'm so powerless it just [A7]caries me away
And [Am]where it's taking [G]me I never [C]know
The [Am]only thing that [G]I can do 
Is [D7]hope it's somewhere I wanna [G]go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Not that [Em]January night under that street light 
With the [B7]snow falling all around
And I'm [Em]telling you things that I don't really mean 
But they [C]just keep coming [B7]out
And I [Em]see your unbelieving tears 
Your [B7]speechless breath hanging in the air
And I [Em]watch you throw your [G]ring out in the [A7]snow
And [Am]there I wait [G]until your memory [D7]goes somewhere I wanna [Em]go [D7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G]Like that weekend when we [D7]just took off
Driving [Em]in that April sun 
Any[C]where the feeling went[G]
We ended up in [D7]Montreal
Couldn't [Em]understand the words 
But we [A7]learned to laugh in French
Where your [Am]memory wants to [G]take me I don't [C]know
The [Am]only thing that [G]I can do 
Is [D7]hope it's somewhere I wanna [G]go

And [Am]there I wait [G]until your memory [D7]goes somewhere I wanna [Em]go [D7]

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Make it somewhere I wanna [Em]go [C]
Some[G]where I wanna go
Dancing down at [D7]Mardi Gras (somewhere I wanna [Em]go)
That little motel room in [C]Arkansas (somewhere I wanna [G]go)
The nights we just sat [D7]up (somewhere I wanna [Em]go)
Somewhere I wanna [C]go
Make it somewhere I wanna [G]go
