{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[F]As the midnight moon was drifting through
[C]The lazy sway of the trees
I saw the look in your eye looking into the [F]night
[C]Not seeing what you wanted too see
Darling don't say a word I've already [Am]heard
What your body is saying to [F]mine
You’ve got a fast [G7]move you got a slow [F]groove  on your [G7]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You want a man with a slow [C]hand 
You want a lover with an easy [Am]touch
[F]You want somebody who will spend some [C]time
Not come and go in a heated [Am]rush
[F]Baby believe me I understand  when it comes to [G7]love 
You want a slow [C]hand
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]Moon shadowed ground with no one around 
And the blanket of stars in our [C]eyes
Hey we’re drifting free like two [F]lost leaves
On the crazy wind of the [C]night
Darling don't say a word I've already [Am]heard 
What your body is saying to [F]mine
If you want [G7]all night you know it's all [F]right  I’ve [G7]got time
{end_of_verse}

You’ve got a lover with an easy [Am]touch

Not come and go in a heated [Am]rush
[F]Baby believe me I understand  when it comes to [G7]love
