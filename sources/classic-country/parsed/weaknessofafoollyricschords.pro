{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Well I'll admit that [F]from the start [C]there was this [G7]certain [C]doubt
[G7]That I could ever hold your love for [C]long
[F]The tempting thought [C]then came to me [G7]why not try her [C]out
[G7]You never know you just might be her [C]song
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]I let you lead me to [C]believe I was your [G7]only [C]thrill
[G7]That I was one exception to the [C]rule
[F]Then with cunning ways and [C]evil mind you moved [G7]in for the [C]kill
[G7]And played upon the weakness of this [C]fool
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]My better judgment [C]tells me I [G7]better pack and [C]leave
[G7]But then my heart makes another [C]rule
[F]I walk away then run right [C]back knowin' [G7]that I'll [C]grieve
[G7]But that's just the weakness in a [C]fool
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[F]I've lost a count of [C]all the times I've [G7]walked away from [C]you
[G7]To have my heart just drag me back [C]again
[F]But that's the way a fool [C]in love will always [G7]follow [C]through
[G7]Knowin' that he has no chance to [C]win
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[F]I wish that I could find the [C]strength to free [G7]you from my [C]mind
[G7]And let my better judgment be the [C]rule
[F]Oh I'd walk away and not [C]return and leave [G7]you far [C]behind
[G7]If it wasn't for the weakness in this [C]fool
[G7]If it wasn't for the weakness in this [C]fool
{end_of_verse}
