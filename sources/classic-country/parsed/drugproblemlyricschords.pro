[C]I hear people talkin' about going cold turkey
Dryin' [F]out checkin' into Betty [C]Ford
But [F]I just can't relate to all those [C]strange a[Am]ddictions
Cuz [D7]my drug problem never went [G7]ignored

You see [C]I was drug to [F]Church on Sunday [C]morning

And I [D7]was drug to weddings and to [G7]funerals
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I was [C]drug out the [F]door to go to [C]school everyday

And those [C]drugs are still [F]running through my [C]veins

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I won't claim I [F]grew up to be [C]perfect far from it

And [D7]hear those prayers roll from momma's [G7]lips
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
That's [C]why I count my [F]blessings every [C]evening
