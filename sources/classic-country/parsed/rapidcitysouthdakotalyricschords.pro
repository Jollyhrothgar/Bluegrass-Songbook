[C]Just a ragged kid in [F]overalls he [G7]thumbed a ride one [C]day
Said [F]anywhere you're headed is on my [G7]way

Well he left her just a [F]blanket of [G7]snow up on the [C]farm
[F]That won't keep your conscience very [G7]warm

And there ain't [F]no money in pumpin' gaso[G7]line

Now the reason he was [F]goin' I'm [G7]not sure I could [C]say
Might've [F]been the rodeo in Santa [G7]Fe
There's a [C]doctor in Chica[F]go I [G7]know she'll be al[C]right
[F]He told himself as he stared into the [G7]night
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
He said I [F]hope to God she finds
The goodbye [C]letter that I wrote her
Cause the [G7]mail don't move too fast
