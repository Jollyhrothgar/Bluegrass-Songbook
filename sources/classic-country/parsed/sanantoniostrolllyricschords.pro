[C]When I was a child down in South [D7]Caroline

Just [D7]singing the whole night [G7]through

They held [D7]hands and began to [G7]stroll
I've been away [C]for a while but it still brings a [D7]smile
When I [F]think of the [G7]way that it [Am]goes
Now I'll [F]sing it to you just so we [C]both can [A7]do
That old San [D7]Antonio [C][G7]Stroll
