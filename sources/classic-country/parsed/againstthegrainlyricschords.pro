[C]Folks call me a maverick guess I ain't too diplomatic

[Am]Sometimes you just can't [G7]be afraid to [F]wear a different hat

Well I have been accused of makin' my own rules
There [A#7]must be rebel blood just a [F]runnin' through my [C]veins

{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Well there's more folks than a few who share my point of view
But they're [A#7]worried if they're [F]gonna sink or [C]swim
They'd like to buck the system but the deck is stacked against 'em
And they're a [A#7]little scared to [F]go out on a [G7]limb
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
But if you're [Am]gonna make a [G7]difference if you're [F]gonna leave your mark
You can't [Dm]follow like a [D7]bunch of sheep you got to listen to your [G7]heart
