{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]You have always wanted the [G7]finest things in life
So that all your dreams could come true I've [F]slaved with all my [C]might
But the plans I made for you and me [G7]have all gone to waste
Cause in the world you live now for [F]me there is no [C]place
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]Gone is the sweet and simple girl  [C]that I have loved so long
And [F]in her place a stranger lives 
Who wants a [C]dream world and not a [G7]home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
With the [C]sunrise I'll be gone and then [G7]daring you'll be free
Free to live the life you want and never [F]be bothered by [C]me
For I am just a simple guy who couldn't keep [C7]up with the [G7]pace
Cause in the world you live now for [F]me there is no [C]place
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[G7]And in the world you live now for [F]me there is no [C]place
{end_of_verse}
