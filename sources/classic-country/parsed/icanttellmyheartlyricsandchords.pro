{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Oh foolish heart why won’t you [G7]believe
Your softness and stubbornness has caused me to [C]grieve
Still pining for someone who can never come [F]back
I [G7]know that’s so but I can’t tell my heart [C]that
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I can’t tell my heart that you are no [G7]good
I’d give this world if only I [C]could
You cheated and lied then you left me [F]flat
Oh [G7]yes it’s true but I can’t tell my heart [C]that
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
My heart still cries out it wasn’t long [G7]ago
That we were together and you said you loved me [C]so
Oh somewhere out there it don’t matter where [F]at
To [G7]you I’m forgotten but I can’t tell my heart [C]that
{end_of_verse}
