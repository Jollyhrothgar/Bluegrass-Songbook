{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Now that you're gone all that's left is a [G7]band of gold
All that's left of the [F]dream I hold is a band of gold
And the [Em]memory of what [Dm]love could be
If [C]you were still [Dm]here with [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You took me from the shelter of a lover I had [G7]never known
Or loved any other [F]we kissed after taking vows
But [C]that night on our [F]honey[Dm]moon
We [C]stayed in [Dm]separate [C]rooms
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I wait in the darkness of my [G7]lonely room
Filled with sadness [F]filled with gloom
Hoping soon that [C]you'll walk back [F]through that [Dm]door
And [C]love me like you [Dm]did be[C]fore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Since you're gone all that's left is a [G7]band of gold
All that's left of the [F]dream I hold is a band of gold
And the [Em]memory of what [Dm]love could be
If [C]you were still [Dm]here with [C]me
