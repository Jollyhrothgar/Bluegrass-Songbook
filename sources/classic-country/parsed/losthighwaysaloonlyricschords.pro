{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]On a dark deserted highway in [Em]the southwest Texas hills
[F]I grew tired of the journey and the [G7]rollin’ of the wheels
So I [C]pulled off to the roadside there be[Am]neath the midnight moon
By [C]flashing neon [F]remnants that read The [G7]Lost Highway [C]Saloon
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I walked into the rundown ruins time had [Em]left around the bend
An [F]old man in a worn out hat [G7]smiled and said come in
I dropped a [C]nickel in the jukebox while the [Am]old man drew my beer
And I [F]let the sound of the music drown the [G7]road noise from my [C]ears
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Hank [Am]Williams sang a [Em]sad one as I [F]sat back down a[C]gain
Then I [Am]heard a host of [F]other ghostly [Dm]voices joining [G7]in
There’s was [Am]Ernest Webb and [Em]Lefty in an [F]old familiar [C]tune
Playin’ [Am]on the haunted [F]jukebox at the [Dm]Lost High[G7]way Sa[C]loon
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
There were people all around me where [Em]there was no one before
And the [F]clicking of their boot heels rambled [G7]through the old dance floor
The room was [C]filled with smoke and laughter [Am]Bob Wills fiddle [C]played
Tommy [F]Duncan sang and the Texas Playboys [G7]played the night [C]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I [Am]listened to the [Em]songs I knew and a [F]few I’d never [C]heard
As [Am]my heroes sang for [F]me that night I [Dm]hung on every [G7]word
I could [Am]smell the whiskey [Em]on Hank’s breath [F]and Patsy Cline’s [C]perfume
All [Am]around the haunted [F]jukebox at the [Dm]Lost High[G7]way Sa[C]loon
Spoken:
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Then the music softly faded the laughter [Em]slowly died
And the [F]old man tipped his hat to me as I bid him [G7]goodnight
He [C]said you’ve come a long way son then he [F]called me by my [Am]name
And he [F]said you’ve still got a [C]long way to [F]go 
And [G7]no two journey’s [C]ever end the same
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Many [Am]times I’ve rode that [Em]highway lookin’ [F]for that place [C]again
But [Am]there’s only hills and [F]open fields and [Dm]soon the highway [G7]ends
I guess our [Am]time is like that [Em]open road and [F]our lives are merely [C]tunes
Playin’ [Am]on the haunted [F]jukebox at the [Dm]Lost High[G7]way Sa[C]loon
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
So if you [Am]see that light some [Em]lonely night
[F]Stop in and hear the [C]tunes 
Playin’ [Am]on the haunted [F]jukebox at the [Dm]Lost High[G7]way Sa[C]loon
{end_of_verse}
