{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]When the [F]chain of love is [C]broken 
Its pieces scattered all [G7]around 
[C]In the [F]hasty search for [C]reason 
Sometimes a [G7]link cannot be [C]found 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I say you're [F]wrong you say it's [C]my fault 
You saw it coming all [G7]alone 
[C]We've lost the [F]link of under[C]standing 
Our chain of [G7]love can't last [C]long
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
This [G7]chain of love we piece [Dm]together 
With the link of understanding [A7]gone 
The [D7]link of patience must work [G7]overtime 
Our [Dm]chain of [A7]love can't last [D7]long
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]It seems so [F]unfair this should [C]happen 
Two hearts are forced to live [G7]alone 
But the [C]chain's no [F]stronger than its [C]weakest link 
And our chain of [G7]love can't last [C]long 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
This [G7]chain of love we piece [Dm]together 
With the link of understanding [A7]gone 
The [D7]link of patience must work [G7]overtime 
Our [Dm]chain of [A7]love can't last [D7]long
