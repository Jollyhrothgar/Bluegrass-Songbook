[C]Tonight alone I'm thinking of the things we use to [F]do
[G7]There's laughter all around me but my heart still aches for [C]you
The wedding bells are ringing but to me their chimes are [F]blue

The [F]dreams we shared have all been torn [C]apart
It's your wedding day but I can't claim your [G7]heart
Now [C]someone else will hold you just the way I use to [F]do
[G7]How can I face tomorrow when I know I'm losing [C]you
