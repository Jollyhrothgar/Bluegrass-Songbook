[G]If you tried as hard to love me as you do to break my heart
[C]We would always be so happy and the tears would never start
[D7]There would never be another cause we'd never have to part
[G]If you tried as hard to love me as you do to break my heart

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Would be like a trip to dreamland where the skies are always blue
[C]Or a happy life in love-land with nothing else to do
[D7]But then my time of loving the one I wanted from the start
[G]If you tried as hard to love me as you do to break my heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I would always be contented you would be my pride and joy
[C]I would be like a child at Christmas with pretty a brand new toy
[D7]I'd lay aside my heartache and give love another start
[G]If you tried as hard to love me as you do to break my heart
{end_of_verse}
