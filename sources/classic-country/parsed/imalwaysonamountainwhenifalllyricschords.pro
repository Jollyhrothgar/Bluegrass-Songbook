[C]Most of my life I've almost been a [Dm]winner

Just when I thought I’d [C7]finally made [F]it 
I [G7]find myself back where I started [C]from

I [Em]hate to say I'm giving [Dm]up but I [F]believe 
[G7]Losing's just become a way of life for [C]me 
[Em]Losing wouldn't be so bad at [F]all 
But I'm [Dm]always on a [G7]mountain when I [C]fall

Then you came along and had me had me [Dm]believing
For [G7]once in my life my luck had finally [C]changed
And now you say you're [C7]gonna leave [F]me
[G7]Seems everything I do winds up the [C]same
