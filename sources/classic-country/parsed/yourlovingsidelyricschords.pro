[C]You and [G]I have known a love [C]beyond compare
Oh but [D7]lately when we reach out there's [G]nothin' there [C]
We [D7]seem so [G]far apart face to face cause of [C]great divide
But I'd do [D7]anything to get back on your [G]lovin' side

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[D7]To get back on your [G]lovin' side to get that tender feelin' [C]feelin' right
I'd give my heart to keep our [D7]love alive and be a hero in [G]your blue eyes [C]
[D7]To get back on your [G]lovin' side where your life's wrapped [C]up in mine
Whoa my heart won't be [D7]satisfied till I get back on your [G]lovin' side

You know it's a shame that a little [C]rain put out a fire so strong
Now the [D7]chilling truth is the [G]warmth is [C]gone
[D7]Whoa and there's a [G]silence now silent words cut [C]deep and wide
And I'll do [D7]anything to get back on your [G]lovin' side
