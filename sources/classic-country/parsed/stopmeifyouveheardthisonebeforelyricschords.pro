{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Can I buy you a drink you look [C]lonely

But [G]stop me if you've [D7]heard this one [G]before
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
For I wouldn't think of [C]wasting your time 
I've [D7]wasted too much of my [G]own

And I'll [A7]leave if you'd rather be [D7]alone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Cause [G]that's how you were when I [C]walked in  
Well so am [G]I just like you maybe [D7]more

So please [G]stop me if you've [D7]heard this one [G]before
{end_of_verse}
