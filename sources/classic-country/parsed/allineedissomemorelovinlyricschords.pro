[C]All I need is some more lovin' from a [F]pretty girl like [D7]you
To [G7]hold your hand again is all I [C]crave
But I know it's no use dear cause [F]you've gone and left me [D7]blue
I [G7]guess my heart will always be your [C]slave

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [G7]still feel your hand in mine as we [C]said our last goodbye
I [D7]miss the kisses dear we once [G7]knew
Now the [C]memories of the past my dear are [F]making me so [D7]blue
All I [G7]need is some more lovin' dear from [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
As my thoughts turn to our yesterday a [F]tear comes to my [D7]eye
My [G7]heart still yearns for you as you may [C]know
But you found yourself another and you [F]left me here to [D7]cry
With a [G7]memory of a love I treasured [C]so
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I [G7]can still recall the time [C]you promised to be mine
I [D7]can't forget the day we said I [G7]do
Now you've [C]gone away forever and [F]you've torn my heart [D7]into
All I [G7]need is some more lovin' dear from [C]you
{end_of_verse}
