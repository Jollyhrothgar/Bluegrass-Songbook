{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]They say that once the new wears off the [D7]test of love begins
When the spark that lit the fire don't burn as [C]bright as it once [D7]did
If [G]lovers lose that old desire [C]hearts can break [Am]in-two
The [C]hard work starts [D7]when it ain't nothing [G]new
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G7]It ain't nothing new but after all this [C]time
This [A7]love of ours still hasn't lost its [D7]shine
It's [G]making up when we've been mad that [C]I look forward [Am]to
[C]Even though [D7]it ain't nothing [G]new
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now love don't come as easy as [D7]it once did and so
Sometimes we seem to say the things that [C]cut and hurt the [G]most
But then we pull together and [C]somehow see it [Am]through
[C]That's what it takes [D7]when it ain't nothing [G]new
