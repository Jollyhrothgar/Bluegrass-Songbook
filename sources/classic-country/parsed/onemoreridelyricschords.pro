[G]One  [D7]more  [G]ride
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I long for the trip I don't need no grip I'm taking one more ride
[C]Way out there in the prairie air I guess it's in my hide
[G]Oh the clickety clack of the railroad track is [D7]call-ing
[G]If a man can know where the Santa Fe goes when she gets under steam
[C]And the big loud bell that bongs farewell could hear her whistle scream
[G]She's bound to go where there ain't no snow a [D7]fall-ing  [G]one  [D7]more  [G]ride
[D7]One  more  [G]ride
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I miss the gloom of the pale light moon that seemed to know my name
[C]And the tumbleweeds where the prairie don't feed I miss them just the same
[G]They're all a part of a song of heart I'm [D7]sing-ing
[G]I recall the tune that I sang to the moon and it seemed to make him smile
[C]And I rode away at the close of the day and I stayed so long awhile
[G]But I long to be where the memory is [D7]ring-ing  [G]one  [D7]more  [G]ride
[D7]One  more  [G]ride
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
As the years go by I wonder why I longed to leave my home
[C]And to hit the trail of the iron rail away out there alone
[G]But my heart would sigh till I know that I am [D7]leav-ing
[G]If I don't come back on a one-way track way down in Mexico
[C]You'll find me there or any old where that a tumbleweed will grow
[G]So it's goodbye now you'll never know how I'm [D7]griev-ing  [G]one  [D7]more  [G]ride
[D7]One  more  [G]ride
{end_of_verse}
