{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I met her sadly in the [C]slowly fallin' [G]rain crying softly
In her [C]loneliness and [G]pain knowing no [C]one
Needin' [D7]someone as bad as [G]me
And she told me as I [C]held her tremblin' [G]hand walkin' slowly 
How she'd [C]never known a [G]man livin' [C]lonely
In her [D7]cottage by the [G]sea
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
When the [C]mornin' came her [D7]tears had changed to [G]laughter
And [C]before the night her [D7]heart beat close to [G]mine
And I [C]thought as she lay [D7]sleepin' of the [G]secret she was [Em]keepin'
Hidden [C]somewhere in the [Am]silence of the [D7]shadows of her [G]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
In the mornin' as I [C]wakened with the [G]dawn without warnin' 
I could [C]feel that she was [G]gone leavin' [C]nothin' 
But her [D7]silence next to [G]me
And lonely footprints that I [C]followed in the [G]sand walking slowly
For I [C]knew where they would [G]end disa[C]ppearing 
In the [D7]silence of the [G]sea
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
And I [C]sometimes hear the [D7]echoes of her [G]laughter
As I [C]search for what I [D7]know I'll never [G]find
For the [C]answer I was [D7]seeking was a [G]secret she's still [Em]keeping
Hidden [C]somewhere in the [Am]silence of the [D7]shadows of her [G]mind 
{end_of_verse}
