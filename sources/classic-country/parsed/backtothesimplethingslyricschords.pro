{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]It' so [G]easy to get all [Bm]caught up
In the [C]fast pace of this modern [D7]age
Makes you [G]wonder if we’re making [Bm]progress
Or just [C]losing who we are along the [D7]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[Em]I've been trying to figure out 
How to [Bm]dial it back and slow it down 
[C]Can't be as compli[D7]cated as it [G]seems
The [Em]heart of me loves yesterday
So [Bm]pardon me now while I make
[C]My way back [D7]to the simple [G]things
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]If you [G]call me I may not [Bm]answer
Might [C]not get back to you for quite a [D7]while
I'll be [G]fishin' with my [Bm]family
Cause [C]livin' in the moments more my [D7]style
{end_of_verse}

[C]My way back [D7]to the simple [G]things
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]Tonight I'm turnin' [Bm]off the [G]TV
[D7]Watch the stars out for a [G]change
[C]Sit on the front [Bm]porch with my [G]baby
Rockin' [D7]all the [Em]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Maybe that'll help me figure out
How to [Bm]dial it back and slow it down 
[C]Can't be as compli[D7]cated as it [G]seems
The [Em]heart of me loves yesterday
So [Bm]pardon me now while I make
[C]My way back [D7]to the simple [G]things
