{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I know the sun will rise tomorrow [D7]morning
And [G7]when the sun comes up I'll still be [C]blue
I know a storm can come without a [D7]warning
But [G7]I don't know why I keep loving [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I keep [F]waiting for the change that [G7]I waited for so [C]long
The [D7]change that will mean you love me [G7]too
But I [C]know from the past there'll be no [D7]changing
And [G7]I don't know why I keep loving [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I know that you can't help the things you're [D7]doing
You [G7]don't mean to hurt me but you [C]do
I know if this keeps up you'll be my [D7]ruin
And [G7]I don't know why I keep loving [C]you
{end_of_verse}
