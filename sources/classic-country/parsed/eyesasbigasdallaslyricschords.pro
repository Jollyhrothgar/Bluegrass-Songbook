{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]She came on as strong as a south Texas wind
She was nobody's lover just [G7]everybody's friend
She had everything that any man could need
I found here in Laredo she's like a Texas Tornado
And she had eyes as big as Dallas for [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
They said trying to love her is like taming the wind
But I knew she wasn't wild she just [G7]never gave in
She just wanted to live and remain free
I met her in Laredo she's like a Texas tornado
And she had eyes as big as Dallas for [C]me
