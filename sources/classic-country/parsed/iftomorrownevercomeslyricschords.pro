{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Sometimes late at [Dm]night
[G7]I lie awake and watch her [C][F]sleeping
She's [G7]lost in peaceful [Dm]dreams
So I turn [G7]out the lights [F]and lay there in [C]the [C][F]dark
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And the thought crosses my [Dm]mind
[G7]If I never wake up in the [C][F]morning
[G7]Would she ever doubt [Dm]the way I [G7]feel
[F]About her in [C]my [C][F]heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
If tomorrow never [F]comes
Will she know how much I love [C]her
Did I try in every [G7]way to [Dm]show her every [G7]day
That [F]she's my only [C]one
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
And if my time on earth [C7]were [F]through
And she must face this [G7]world [Am]without [Em]me
[Am]Is the love I gave her in the [Dm]past
Gonna be enough to [G7]last
If tomorrow never [G7][C]comes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[C]Cause I've lost love ones in my [Dm]life
[G7]Who never knew how much I [F]loved [C]them
Now I [G7]live with the [Dm]regret
That my true [G7]feelings for [F]them never [C]were [C][F]revealed
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
So I made a promise to [Dm]myself
[G7]To say each day how much she [F]means to [C]me
And [G7]avoid that [Dm]circumstance
Where there's no [G7]second chance to [F]tell her how I [C]feel
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
If tomorrow never [F]comes
Will she know how much I love [C]her
Did I try in every [G7]way to [Dm]show her every [G7]day
That [F]she's my only [C]one
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
And if my time on earth [C7]were [F]through
And she must face this [G7]world [Am]without [Em]me
[Am]Is the love I gave her in the [Dm]past
Gonna be enough to [G7]last
If tomorrow never [G7][C]comes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 9}
[C]So tell that someone that you [Dm]love
Just what you’re thinking [G7]of
If tomorrow never [C][F]comes
{end_of_verse}
