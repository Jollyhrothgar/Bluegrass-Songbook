{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Our past is always present [C]where my future is [G]concerned
[C]And I'd found the doors all [G]locked to me no matter where I [D7]turn
[G]I can't even build new memories [C]when your memory's here to [G]stay
[C]And I cannot face the [G]future for our [D7]past is in my [G]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[D7]I can't go out with someone else and [G]do the [C]things we'd [G]do
[D7]And I can't even look ahead for [C]looking back at [D7]you
[G]I'm torn between tomorrow [C]and the scars of [G]yesterday
[C]And I cannot face the [G]future for our [D7]past is in my [G]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[D7]I was so much stronger yesterday [G]when you walked by [C]my [G]side
[D7]But I'm weaker for you left me here and the [C]heart within me [D7]died
[G]What I was speak so much louder [C]than what I am [G]today
[C]And I cannot face the [G]future for our [D7]past is in my [G]way
{end_of_verse}
