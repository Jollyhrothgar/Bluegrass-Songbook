{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I've searched the world over all of my life
Just [F]looking for [C]something to [F]make my love [C]shine
Like a candle that burns in the night
But I [F]came up with nothing till I [C]looked in your [G7]eyes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]Deeper and deeper [G7]inside and [C]all of the [G7]treasures
I [F]found in your [C]soul [F]
Was [Am]like finding a diamond [F]
When you're mining for [C]coal [G7]   [F]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]I've been a fool for glitter and gold
And [F]women that [C]sparkle [F]shiny and [C]cold
Like a statue carved out of ice
They [F]shimmer like [C]tinsel [F]on a blue Christmas [G7]night
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
But they [F]never were quite so [G7]bright
As [C]all of the [G7]treasures
That [F]loving you [C]holds [F]
It's like [Am]finding a diamond [F]
When you're mining for [C]coal[G7]    [C]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[G7]I was a miner and [F]you were a rock in the [C]dust
But [D7]you became flawless
When you were you polished by [G7]love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
[C]But I [G7]found you I [F]lost all [C]control[F]
I [Am]found me a diamond [F] just mining for [C]coal
Repeat last verse
{end_of_verse}
