Good morning self  how do you [D7]feel  now that she's [G]gone
And we just stand here  you and [D7]me  all a[G]lone
With [C]nothing in this world  but [G]lonely loneli[C]ness
Although I [G]cried your eyes are [D7]dry  good morning [G]Jim

Now don't [D7]try to pre[C]tend you don't [G]remember
No need to [D7]l-ie about [C]the way you [G]treated her oh [D7]no
Just [G]remember I was [D7]there when it [G]happened
And I heard those things you [D7]said as she [G]left

You're the [C]only one to blame but we [G]both must share the [C]pain
