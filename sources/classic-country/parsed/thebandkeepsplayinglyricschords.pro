{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]You walked in with me but you walked out with someone [F]else
And [G7]left me sitting here alone all by [C]myself
I thought you were over him but I was [F]wrong
My world [G7]stopped  but the band keeps playing [C]on
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
They [F]just keep playing they don't notice you were [C]gone
You [F]walked right out on me while [C]they played our favorite [G7]song
And [C]before you reached the door  my teardrops hit the [F]floor
My world [G7]stopped  but the band keeps playing [C]on
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well you said you'd forgotten him and no more did you [F]care
But [G7]when we walked in your eyes lit up as you saw him sitting [C]there
Well he asked you to dance and just like that you were [F]gone
And my world [G7]stopped  but the band keeps playing [C]on
{end_of_verse}
