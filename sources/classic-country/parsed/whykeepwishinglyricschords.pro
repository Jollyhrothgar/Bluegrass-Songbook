{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]You only want me 'round
When someone turns you [D7]down
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You always think of me
As just a friend in [G]need
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I wish you were my own
But still I'm all [D7]alone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
So why keep wishing
When I know that you don't [G]care
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Each time your new love [C]strays
I think you're back to [G]stay
But then you [A7]go away
And leave me so [D7]lonely
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
I guess it just [G]can't be
You're not in love with [D7]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
So why keep wishing
When I know that you don't [G]care
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I wish you were my own
But still I'm all [D7]alone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
So why keep wishing
When I know that you don't [G]care
{end_of_verse}
