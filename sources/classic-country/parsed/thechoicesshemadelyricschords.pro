{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]She didn't have to marry down so [C]far
Fool with raising [G]babies or drive an older [D7]car
[G]She didn't have to give so much and [C]be so underpaid
Lord I don't know [G]how she's living [D7]with the choices she [G]made
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
She didn't have to wear those bargain [C]threads
Or roughen up those [G]dainty hands mopping floors and changing [D7]beds
[G]She had it sweet on easy street [C]with a hand she could have played
But she threw out all her [G]aces [D7]for the choices she [G]made [G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]She'll stand there in defiance of a [G]logic she ignored
[A7]With a strangely peaceful smile upon her [D7]face
[C]Using up her youth on some old [G]cowboy
Who's [A7]try'n' to pay the bills on hope and [D7]faith
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[G]Time goes by it doesn't change a [C]thing
But she still thinks [G]it's worth it all to wear that little [D7]ring
[G]And I still lay beside her wishing [C]I was worth the price she paid
All teary eyed and [G]thankful [D7]for the choices she [G]made
{end_of_verse}
