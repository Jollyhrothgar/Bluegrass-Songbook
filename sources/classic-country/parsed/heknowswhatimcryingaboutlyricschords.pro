{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]You think I’m not going through
All these [C]things I’m telling [G]you
But believe me what I say is really [D7]true
Cause he’s the [G]one who left me here
He’s the [C]one who didn't [G]care
And he knows what I’m [D7]crying [G]about
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I gave him my very best
He was [C]wrong to give me [G]less
And destroy the love I tried so hard to [D7]hold
He made me [G]shed a million tears
I’ve [C]just wasted all these [G]years
So he knows what I’m [D7]crying [G]about
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
He [C]knows what I’m crying [G]about
I bear the shame he’s to blame  
There's [D7]no doubt
He never [G]even tried to say 
Or [C]accept the love I [G]gave
So he knows what I’m [D7]crying [G]about
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Oh he knows what I’m [D7]crying [G]about
