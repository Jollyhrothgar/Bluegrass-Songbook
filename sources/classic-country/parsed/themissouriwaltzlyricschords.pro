{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Hush a bye my [G7]baby slumber [C]time is coming soon
Rest your head [G7]upon my breast while [C]mommy hums a tune
The [F]sandman is calling where [C]shadows are falling
While the [D7]soft breezes sigh as [G7]in days long gone by
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]Way down [G7]in Missouri [C]where I heard this melody
When I was a [G7]little child [C]on my mommy's knees
The old [F]folks were humming their banjos were [C]strumming
So [D7]sweet  [G7]and  [C]low
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Hush a bye my [G7]baby go to [C]sleep on mommy's knee
Journey back to [G7]Dixieland in [C]dreams again with me
It [F]seems like your mommy is [C]there once again
And the [D7]old folks were strumming that [G7]same old refrain
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]Way down in [G7]Missouri [C]where I learned this lullaby
When the stars were [G7]blinking and the [C]moon was climbing high
And I [F]hear mommy glow as in [C]days long ago
Singing [D7]hush  [G7]a   [C]bye
{end_of_verse}
