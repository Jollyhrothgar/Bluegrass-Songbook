{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Today has been my birthday and [C]tonight I should be [G]glad
[C]But you weren't here to share [G]it and [A7]inside I've hurt so [D7]bad
[G]I didn't want your presence just your [C]kiss and [G]company
[C]And your lips to softly [G]whisper happy [D7]birthday to [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]But I came home all by myself and lit the [G]candle
[D7]Made a wish for you and love that used to be
[G]I unwrapped the tiny package [C]that I bought [G]myself
[D7]Then I sang happy birthday to [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]I thought for sure you’d send me at least a birthday [G]card
[C]But the postman [G]didn't even [A7]stop when he passed by my [D7]yard
[G]You could have telephoned and eased a [C]lot of [G]misery
[C]Instead I called [G]myself and said happy [D7]birthday to [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]Then I came home all by myself and lit the [G]candle
[D7]Made a wish for you and love that used to be
[G]I unwrapped the tiny package [C]that I bought [G]myself
[D7]Then I sang happy birthday to [G]me
{end_of_verse}
