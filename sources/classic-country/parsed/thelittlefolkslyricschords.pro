{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]We've decided we [D7]can't work it out
We might as well call it a [G]day
We've agreed to [C]disagree
And [D7]go our separate [G]ways
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
We just don't seem to [D7]get along
We argue and we [G]fuss
So we've agreed that to [C]part as friends
Is [D7]best for both of [G]us
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
But what's gonna happen to the [D7]little folks
The little folks the [G]little folks
What's gonna happen to the [C]little folks
Who [D7]live in our [G]house
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Since we've decided we [D7]can't work it out
We might as well end it this [G]time
We fought enough and [C]fussed enough
And [D7]said too much this [G]time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
So we've agreed that the [D7]thing to do
Is set each other [G]free
You go your way and [C]I'll go mine
That's [D7]best for you and [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
But what's gonna happen to the [D7]little folks
The little folks the [G]little folks
What's gonna happen to the [C]little folks
Who [D7]live in our [G]house
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Well maybe someday [D7]we'll look back
And see how foolish we've [G]been
Cause we might find it's the [C]little ones
Who [D7]lose in the [G]end
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
So maybe things are [D7]not so bad
We're still in love you and [G]I
And maybe we can [C]work it out
If we [D7]give it one more [G]try
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
We owe that much to the [D7]little folks
The little folks the [G]little folks
We owe that much to the [C]little folks
Who [D7]live in our [G]house
{end_of_verse}
