{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Papa brought flowers [F]for mama to[C]day
And all the grown children [D7]but it's not mother's[G7] day
I [C]don't have no money [F]not even a [C]dime
But I brought mama flowers like[G7] I have all the [C]time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Everyday I pick flowers  [F]from this pretty [C]hill
A small box of Daisies [D7]and a few [G7]Daffodils 
I [C]bring them to mama at [F]the end of the [C]day
And say flowers for mama  [G7]here's mama's [C]bouquet
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
They brighten her face and [F]she holds me [C]close
She'd say they are more precious [D7]than a beautiful [G7]rose
And [C]she wore a smile sweeter [F]than millions of [C]flowers
A smile that I'll carry through [G7]life's darkest [C]hours
Spoken:
Now mama was lying there  yes  they tell me she passed away
And she was surrounded by flowers that out shined my bouquet
I know mine aren't fancy but still all the while
They were placed in her hand and I know I saw mama smile
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[F]Flowers for mama I [C]picked them today
Not very much  [D7]just a simple [G7]bouquet
[C]Mom wasn't so fancy [F]but up there [C]above
She's the prettiest flower in [G7]God's garden of [C]love
{end_of_verse}
