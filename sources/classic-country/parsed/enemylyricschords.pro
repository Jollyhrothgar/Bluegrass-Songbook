[G]The work day is done it's time to go [D7]home
It's [C]time to make [G]decisions [A7]I must make [D7]alone
[G]For there's a battlefield between my home and [C]me
And [D7]I must pass directly by the [Em]enemy
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G]There's flashing lights straight [D7]ahead
The [C]neon signs of the [G]barrooms [A7]turn the sky [D7]blood red
I [G]search for strength inside of [C]me
I'm [D7]passing through the homeland of the [Em]enemy
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G]Like a dreaming man I'm in an open [D7]door
Then [C]all the painted [G]faces [A7]remind me I'm at [D7]war
I turn to [G]leave and tremble when I [C]see
The [D7]waiting patient eyes of the [Em]enemy
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[G]Their eyes shine bright they strike me [D7]blind
[C]It's too late to [G]run away [A7]surrender is on my [D7]mind
There's [G]tears at home by now she's missin' [C]me
She'll [D7]know I'm in the arms of the [Em]enemy [D7]   [G]
