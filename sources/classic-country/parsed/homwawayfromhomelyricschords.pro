In unfamiliar [G7]rooms
And though I haven't reached the breakin' point  yet
I know that it could happen [C]soon

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I'm like a ship caught in a storm 
That's just about to break in [F]two
And I know there's not a [G7]home  away from home 
We're goin' [C]home to
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
There's [D7]not a home away from home 
There's just a place to lay the body [G7]down
And [D7]while the body's restin' my head sits up 
And keeps on looking [G7]round for you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}

I can see the end in [G7]sight 
And if you planned to rescue me 
I know it better be [C]denied

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Cause if the sun comes into view 
And I wake up and find you [F]gone
I know I'll never find a [G7]home  away from home
We're goin' [C]home to
repeat last verse  Yeah if the sun ...
