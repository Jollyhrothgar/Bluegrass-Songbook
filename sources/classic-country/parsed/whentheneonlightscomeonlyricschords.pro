{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I barely make it through the day from the [Dm]swinging all night long
With the [G7]jukebox crowd is where I [C]belong
Where women are the pastime I’m [Dm]sure to hear the call
If it [G7]wasn’t for the nightlife I’d have no life at [C]all
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
When the neon lights come on I come alive
I need honky tonkin’ music to [G7]survive 
Through the bars and neon jungle I live to do my number
When the neon lights come on I come [C]alive
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
From bar to bar I move about when [Dm]night lights turn me on
I [G7]live my hardest living in a [C]world of wine and song
I’m compelled and under a spell to go [Dm]back one more time
The [G7]things I really worship are beneath the neon [C]signs 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
When the neon lights come on I come alive
I need honky tonkin’ music to [G7]survive 
Through the bars and neon jungle I live to do my number
When the neon lights come on I come [C]alive
