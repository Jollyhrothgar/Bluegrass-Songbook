{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I remember the year that [D7]Clayton Delaney [G7][G]died
They [C]said for the last two weeks that he suffered and [G7][G]cried
It [C]made a big impression on me although I was a barefoot [G]kid
They said he got religion at the [D7]end and I'm glad that he [G]did
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Clayton was the best guitar picker in our town
I thought he was a hero and I used to follow Clayton around
I often wondered why Clayton who seemed so good to me
Never took his guitar and made it down in Tennessee
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well daddy said he drank a lot but I could never understand
I knew he used to picked up in Ohio with a five piece band
Clayton used to tell me son you better put that old guitar away
Ain't no money in it it'll lead you to an early grave
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I guess if I'd admit it Clayton taught me how to drink booze
I can see him half stoned a picking out the Lovesick Blues
When Clayton died I made him a promise I was gonna carry on somehow
I'd give a hundred dollars if he could only see me now
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I remember the year that Clayton Delaney died
Nobody ever knew it but I went out in the woods and I cried
Well I know there's a lotta big preachers that know a lot more than I do
But it could be that the good Lord likes a little picking too
Yeah I remember the year that [D7]Clayton Delaney [G]died
{end_of_verse}
