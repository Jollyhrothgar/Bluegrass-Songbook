{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]The mornin' sun touched lightly on the [C]eyes of Lucy [G]Jordan 
In her white suburban bedroom in her [D7]white suburban town 
As she [G]lay there 'neath the covers dreaming [C]of a [G]thousand lovers 
Till the [D7]world turned to orange and the room went spinnin' [G]round
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
At the [C]age of 37 she [G]realized she'd never ride through Paris 
In a sports car with the warm wind in her [D7]hair 
So she [G]let the phone keep ringin' as she [C]sat there softly [G]singin' 
Pretty [D7]nursery rhymes she'd memorized in her [C]daddy's easy [G]chair
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Her husband he was off to work and the [C]kids were off to [G]school 
And there were oh so many ways for [D7]her to spend her day 
She [G]could clean the house for hours [C]or rearrange the [G]flowers 
Or run [D7]naked down the shady street screaming all the [G]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
At the [C]age of 37 she [G]realized she'd never ride through Paris 
In a sports car with the warm wind in her [D7]hair 
So she [G]let the phone keep ringin' as she [C]sat there softly [G]singin' 
Pretty [D7]nursery rhymes she'd memorized in her [C]daddy's easy [G]chair
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
The evening sun touched gently on the [C]eyes of Lucy [G]Jordan 
On the rooftop where she'd climbed when all the laughter grew too [D7]loud 
And she [G]bowed and curtseyed to the man [C]who reached 
And offered her his [G]hand 
And [D7]led her down to the long white car that waited [G]past the crowd
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
At the [C]age of 37 she'd [G]finally found forever 
As they rode along through Paris 
With the warm wind in her [D7]hair [G]
{end_of_verse}
