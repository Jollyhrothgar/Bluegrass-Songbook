{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I've heard the sound of my dear old [Am]mama [C]cry-ing 
And [D7]the sound of the train that took me off [G]to war 
And the awful sound of a thousand bombs [C]ex-ploding 
And I [Am]wondered if I could take it [D7]anymore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
There were [G]times when they almost drove me [C]crazy 
But [D7]I did my best and took it like a [G]man 
But who would think in my lonely room I'd [Am]h-ear [C]it 
The [D7]one sound in the world my heart can't [G]stand 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
To hear that sound and to know it’s really [C]over 
Through tear stained eyes I [G]watched her walk [D7]away 
And of [G]earthquakes storms guns and war 
Lord [C]nothing has ever hurt me more
Than that [G]lonely sound the [D7]closing of the [G]door
