[C]I guess I should've felt it when you [F]touched me
[C]I should've seen it in your [F]eyes

[Em]Why can't I believe you've said good[G7]bye

Oh [C]why is the last one to [F]know
The first one to [C]cry and the last to let [G7]go

With no one to [G7]hold the last one to [C]know

It would be easier to face the [F]morning

With no one to [G7]hold the last one to [C]know
