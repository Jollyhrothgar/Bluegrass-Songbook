[C]I've been a traveler the most of my life

Ran away young and decided to roam
But now I'd like to see my [G7]momma and my papa back [C]home

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]Well a home where the [C]river runs cold
The [G7]water tastes good the [C]winters ain't [F]cold
A home where [C]trees grow tall
The [G7]home fires burn the whippoor[C]wills call
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well I remember stories that my pappy used to tell
Yeah [G7]my eyes would get big my [C]chest just a swell
I could sit for hours and listen with glee
As he'd tell of how he lived when [G7]he's a boy like [C]me
