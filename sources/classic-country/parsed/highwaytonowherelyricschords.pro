{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I'm traveling the highway to [C]nowhere 
Cause [G]I can't find the road to your [D7]heart
This old [G]road is so rough and so [C]rocky 
I get [G]lost on the [D7]highway to your [G]heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
This [D7]highway to nowhere keeps [G]calling 
Your [C]heart's at the end of the [G]line
But I always get lost on a [C]detour 
Cause I [G]guess I don't [D7]understand the [G]signs

I've travelled this highway so long [C]now

Though I [G]know I've been [D7]lost from the [G]start
