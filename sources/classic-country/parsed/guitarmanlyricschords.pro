{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Well I quit my job down at the car wash 
I left my momma a goodbye note 
By sundown I’d left Kingston 
With my guitar under my coat 
I hitch-hiked [F]all the way down to Memphis 
Got a room at the Y.M.C.A. 
For the [C]next three weeks I went a hauntin’ them night clubs 
[G7]Lookin’ for a place to [C]play 
Well I [G7]thought my pickin’ would set ‘em on fire 
But [F]nobody wanted to hire a guitar [C]man 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Well I nearly bout starved to death down in Memphis 
I run outta money and luck 
So I bummed me a ride down to Macon Georgia 
On a overloaded poultry truck 
I thumbed on [F]down to Panama City 
Started pickin’ out some of them all-night bars 
[C]Hopin’ I could make myself a dollar 
[G7]Makin’ music on my [C]guitar 
I got the [G7]same old story at them all night piers 
There [F]ain’t no room around here for a guitar [C]man 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
So I [F]slept in the hobo jungles 
I bummed a thousand miles of track 
Till I [C]found myself in Mobile Alabama 
In a club they call Big Jack’s 
A little [F]four piece band was jammin’ 
So I took my guitar and I sat in 
I [D7]showed ‘em what a band would sound like 
With a [G7]swingin’ little guitar man [C]show ‘em son
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
So if you ever take a trip down to the ocean 
Find yourself down around Mobile 
Well make it out to a club called Jack’s 
If you got a little time to kill 
Just [F]follow that crowd of people 
You’ll wind up out on his dance floor 
[C]Diggin’ the finest little five piece group 
[G7]Up and down the Gulf of [C]Mexico 
And [G7]guess who’s leadin’ that five piece band 
[F]Wouldn’t you know it’s that swingin’ little guitar [C]man 
{end_of_verse}
