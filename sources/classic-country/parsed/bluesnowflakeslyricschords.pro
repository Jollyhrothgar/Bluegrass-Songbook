{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Blue snowflakes [F]cover the [C]ground
When a blue lover has no [G7]sweetheart around
[C]And those [F]blue snowflakes [C]fall from the skies
Like the blue blue teardrops [G7]from my [C]eyes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
(Sweethearts shopping everywhere dashing through the snow)
The [G7]gifts all wrapped in bright red ribbons everywhere I [C]go
(Decorating trees of green for the ones they love)
[G7]But for me I only see blue snowflakes from [C]above
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
(Blue snowflakes [F]cover the [C]ground)
When a blue lover has no [G7]sweetheart around
([C]And those [F]blue snowflakes [C]fall from the skies
Like the blue blue teardrops [G7]from his [C]eyes)
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I remember her first kiss on an old sleigh ride
The [G7]white snowflakes looked just like stardust with her by my [C]side
It was then she promised me someday we would wed
([G7]Now those wedding bells will ring for someone else [C]instead)
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Blue snowflakes [F]follow me [C]around
Only blue memories in my [G7]heart can be found

Like the blue blue teardrops [G7]from my [C]eyes
Like the blue blue teardrops [G7]from my [C]eyes
{end_of_verse}
