{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]After traveling through this world of [F]sorrow
No one on [G7]earth to call my [C]friend
I’m on my way back to old [F]Kentucky
Where I met and [G7]loved but could not [C]win
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I’ve always loved you little [F]darling
My heart will [G7]always feel the [C]same
I could never do one thing to [F]hurt you
I’d rather [G7]die than bring you [C]shame 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
When the cold dark shroud is wrapped [F]around me
They lay my [G7]weary head to [C]rest
Will you stand around and gaze [F]upon me
For I’m the [G7]one who loved you [C]best
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
When your golden hair is turned to [F]silver
The master [G7]calls your soul to [C]heaven
Where we can be free from all our [F]troubles
I’ll meet you [G7]there at journey’s [C]end
{end_of_verse}
