{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]While restin' the other evening by the side of the road
I saw an old [G7]farmer in the field that he just hold
His face was all [C]brown and wrinkled by the sun and the wind
[F]And he was talkin' to the Lord just like he'd be talkin' to a [C]friend
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Well he said with his voice calm and [G7]quiet
Them corn tassels need [C]sackin' I got no string to [F]tie it
Had no [C]rain in so long that the fields are mighty dusty
And it's been so unbearable [F]hot that the kids were even gettin' fu[C]ssy
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now that [G7]grass down in the pasture it [C]should be knee high
If we could just have a little [F]shower Lord 
It might keep the cow from goin' dry
Oh [C]but listen to me talkin' you'd think I wasn't grateful
Why if you didn't know me so well Lord 
You'd [G7]think I was downright hate[C]ful
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
You'd think I [F]forgot about that new calf that you sent
And the [C]money in the mail that took care of the rent
Ma's cold's better and Johnny's home from the [F]navy
And that good [C]Sunday dinner of hot chicken and [G7]dumplings and [C]gravy
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
And that new preacher you sent us Lord he's sure a [F]fine young man
Why he's just convertin' them sinners to beat the [C]band
[G7]Well I guess I'll mosey on home now Lord [F]I won't take no more your [C]time
I guess there's plenty folks here about waitin' to ring your line
[G7]Evening to you Lord and watch us over [C]tonight
Don't you worry about us now Lord [G7]cause everything is gonna be all [C]right
{end_of_verse}
