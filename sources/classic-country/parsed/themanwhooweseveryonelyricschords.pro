{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]He's the man who owes everyone something [G7]from a long time [C]ago
[G]Just look at their hands out  they think he don’t [D7]know
[G]He’s one in a million but he owes a million
[G7]To people that he don’t even [C]know
[G]And the indebtedness [D7]stands out  so we all watched the [G]show
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]Once he promised them everything and they all laid it all on the [G]line
[C]But he couldn’t deliver so they swore to get even in [G]time
[C]So life after lifetime they followed demanding their [G]pay
[D7]And the man who owes everyone smiles like he likes it that [G]way
