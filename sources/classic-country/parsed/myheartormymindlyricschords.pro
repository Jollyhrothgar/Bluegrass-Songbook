[C]My mind says forget you and find someone [G7]else

My [G7]mind knows you're more out of reach than a [C]star
Still [F]my heart is [C]longing to be where you [G7]are

Oh which will I [C]follow my [G7]heart or my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

My heart knows I love you and you know it [G7]too
And that's why you treat me the way that you [C]do

Oh which will I [C]follow my [G7]heart or my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}
