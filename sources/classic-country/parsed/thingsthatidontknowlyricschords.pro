{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I've heard it said what you don't know won't make you [D7]blue
But somehow with these [C]words I can't [G]agree
Cause it's not the things I know you do 
That [C]breaks my heart you see
It's the [G]things that I don't [D7]know that's killing [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I don't [D7]see you when you meet him secret[G]ly
But I [D7]think your arms have held him tender[G]ly
So it's not the things I know you do 
That [C]breaks my heart you see
It's the [G]things that I don't [D7]know that's killing [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The little things that you don't notice hurts me [D7]so
Little things no one but [C]me could ever [G]know
I will keep them hidden so no one can [C]ever see
It's the [G]things that I don't [D7]know that's killing [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I don't [D7]see you when you meet him secret[G]ly
But I [D7]think your arms have held him tender[G]ly
So it's not the things I know you do 
That [C]breaks my heart you see
It's the [G]things that I don't [D7]know that's killing [G]me
