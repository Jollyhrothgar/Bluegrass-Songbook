{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[Am]Lately I've been [G7]having more [F]nights that I can't sleep
[C]Storms of life keep blowing [G7]in  some[Am]times it gets so [G7]heavy
It [F]drives me to my knees  [C]and it's coming down a[G7]gain
Then a [F]voice inside re[C]minds me of the [G7]roof over my [Am]head
And my [F]wife and kids are [C]tucked away [Dm]warmly in their [G7]beds
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And [C]up in [D7]heaven some[F]times I wonder [G7]if God sits [C]there and [D7]listens
To [F]all His children [E7]thinking it'd be [Am]nice [G7]if [F]we'd [C]for[F]get 
Our troubles as easy as our [C]bless[D7]ing[F]s
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[Am]Suddenly I [G7]don't feel like [F]counting what I need
[C]So I start counting what I [G7]have when [Am]times are at their [G7]toughest
My [F]wife still stands by me  [C]and my children make me [G7]laugh
Then [F]I crawl back in [C]bed and start to [G7]think as I lay [Am]there
Could it [F]be that He's al[C]ready heard and [Dm]answered all my [G7]prayers
