[C]What causes hearts to thump what makes a rabbit jump
And why do birds make music in the [G7]trees

[G7]If you don't know just ask the birds and [C]bees

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
It's nothing but love love love 
There never was a thing like love
It's the axis that the world is turning [G7]on
Love love love let’s make a little toast to love
It's the hottest fire that burns beneath the [C]sun
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Love love love everybody falls in love 
Even Adam knew that it was lots of [F]fun
Love can happen in a minute 
I [C]love you I thank you I was in it
Thank the [G7]Lord above for love love [C]love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
What makes a fellow sing what causes phones to ring
And what makes people hold each other [G7]tight
What causes folks to [C]part and [F]sit out in the dark
And [G7]what's the reason lights go out at [C]night
