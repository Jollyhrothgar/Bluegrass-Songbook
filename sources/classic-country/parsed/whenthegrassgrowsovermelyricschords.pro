{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I'll be over you when the [D7]grass grows over [G]me
When you left I thought that I would soon be over [C]you
Even [D7]told myself that I would find somebody [G]new
Time and tears have come and gone but not your [C]memory
But I'll be [G]over you when the [D7]grass grows over [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Yes I'll be [C]over you when you're standing over [G]me
And [A7]as you look down at the cold cold ground I'm sleeping [D7]in
Don't [G]expect to hear me say that I still love you [C]then
'Cause I'll be [G]over you when the [D7]grass grows over [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Even when my eyes are closed they keep on seeing [C]you
Every [D7]minute  I'm alive I'm hurting through and [G]through
And as long as I live I know I won't be [C]free
But I'll be [G]over you when the [D7]grass grows over [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}

'Cause I'll be [G]over you when the [D7]grass grows over [G]me
