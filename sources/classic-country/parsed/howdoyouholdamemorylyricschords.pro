How do you kiss the lips so [C]soft and warm 
That [D7]once were just your [G7]own
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
How do you [C]walk with someone that you loved 
When [F]she's not by your side
How do you hold a memory [C]in your heart 
You'll never [G7]know how hard I [C]tried
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
How [F]do you [G7]hold back the tears that [C]fall
And [D7]never think of things your heart [G7]recalls

That [F]never can come true
How do you hold a memory [C]in your heart 
My [G7]memory of [C]you
