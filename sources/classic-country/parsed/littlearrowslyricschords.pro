[G]There's a boy a little boy shooting arrows in the [D7]blue
And he's aiming them at someone but the question is at [G]who

But you'll know it when they hit you cause they hurt a little [G]bit

When [D7]you're in love you'll find those little arrows [G]everywhere

Some folk a run and others hide but there is nothing they can [D7]do

That you love those little arrows when they hurt a little [G]bit
