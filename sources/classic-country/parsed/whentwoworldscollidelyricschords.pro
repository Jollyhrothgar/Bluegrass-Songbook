[G]Your world was so different from [Em]mine don't you [A7]see

[C]Your world was made up of [G]things sweet and [G7]good
[C]My world could never fit in [G]wish it [D7]could
Two [G]hearts lie in [G7]shambles and oh [A7]how they've cried
That's what [D7]happens when two worlds [G7][G]collide
{end_of_verse}

That's what [D7]happens when two worlds [G]collide
