{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Hello Faye I'm [C]glad you called I [D7]know it's been a [G]long while
[C]Since I held your soft young [G]body close to [D7]me
And I've [G]laid awake so [C]many nights and [D7]thought about your [G]warm smile
But [C]Faye you know there's lots of [G]miles between [C]Las Vegas 
And the [D7]hills of Tenne[G]ssee
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And Faye I lied to [C]you a little [D7]bit out there in [G]Vegas
Cause [C]I'm a several years [G]ahead of thirty-[D7]two
And [G]I said things that [C]lead you to [D7]believe I had no [G]family
And it's [C]killing me to [G]tell you I've [C]got a son 
That's [D7]almost as old as [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
There's [D7]19 years and 1800 [C]miles between us [G]Faye
I could [C]whip the miles in [G]two days driving [D7]time
There's [C]19 years and [D7]1800 [G]miles between us [C]Faye
But it's [G]not the miles that's [C]bothering my [G]mind
It's not the miles that's [C]bothering my [G]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
You're 21 and [C]I'm 2 score and [D7]full of vim and [G]vigor
I can [C]rise and shine with [G]each new morning [D7]sun
But come [G]twenty years I [C]know I'm gonna [D7]be a tired old [G]sixty
You'll [C]still be young and [G]pretty and [C]reaching for your [D7]prime at 4[G]1
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
And when I'm sittin’ [C]in the shade and [D7]thinking of re[G]tirement
Your young [C]body will be [G]restless with [D7]desire
We'll [G]go to bed and [C]I’ll turn my back and [D7]sadly whisper [G]goodnight
And grieve [C]myself to death to [G]know that I'm not [C]man enough 
To [D7]quench my woman's [G]fire
{end_of_verse}
