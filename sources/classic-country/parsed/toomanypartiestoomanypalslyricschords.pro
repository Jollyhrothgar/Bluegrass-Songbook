{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[D7]Gentlemen of the jury the judge's speech began
The scene was a [G7]crowded courtroom 
And the [C]judge a stern old man
This prisoner here before you [A7]is a social enemy
[D7]A lady of the evening and you know the penalty
Her eyes [G7]reflect the nightlife her cheeks they're red with paint
But [C]I knew her mother gentlemen why her mother was a saint
Now I know that she's not like her and yet [D7]she might have been
If it hadn't been for pettin' parties [G7]cigarettes and gin
We took the night life off the [C]streets 
And brought it in our own homes
While girls beat time with lip[G7]stick 
And the [A7]streaks of saxophones
We [D7]opened up the underworld to the ones we loved so well
So tell me [G7]gentlemen is it right to send her to a cell
[C]If she drinks well you taught her 
And if she smokes you showed her how
So [A7]gentlemen do you think it's right to go and [D7]condemn her now
And when you're in that jury room just [G7]remember there and then
That for every fallen [C]woman why there's a hundred fallen men
And before you render a [G7]verdict on [A7]what this girl has done
Just [D7]remember there's a man to blame 
And that man might be your [G7]son
Now gentlemen that's my story my testimony stands
This [C]girl is my own daughter and the case is in your hands
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Those Broadway [A7]roses and [D7]prevalent sounds
At [C]too many parties and [G7]too many [C]pals
{end_of_verse}
