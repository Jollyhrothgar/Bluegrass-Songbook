{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I was sittin' at a table [A]at a [F]little club [C]downtown
Playin' songs on the jukebox [A]and [F]pouring whisky [C]down
When I heard a sweet voice saying [C7]would you like some compa[F]ny 
And I had to tell her 
[C]This is just between [Dm]an old [G7]memory and [C]me  [F]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
All my [C]friends tell me [A]I'm a [F]fool for holdin' [C]on
I know they're trying to help me [A]but I've [F]been a fool too l[C]ong
I don't want to talk about it [C7]so why can't they just let me [F]be
Can't they see 
[C]This is just between [Dm]an old [G7]memory and [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C7]I'm not hurting any[F]body as far as I can [C]see
I just [Am]need to be alone some[G7]times
While she [Dm]goes walking [Em]through my [F]mind [G7]
I don't [C]want to talk about [C7]it why can't everybody [F]see
[C]This is just between [Dm]an old [G7]memory and [C]me
This is just between [Dm]an old [G7]memory and [C]me
