{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]There's a teardrop falling [G7]slowly from my [C]eyes tonight
As I [D7]think of your two arms that [C]used to hold me so very [G]tight
But you're gone now and [G7]girl I'm alone and [C]blue
With just these [G]pictures [D7]and memories of [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Pictures and [C]memories of a love warm and [G]true
Pictures of [D7]love we shared and the memories of [G]you[G7]
But your pictures can't [C]feel my kiss of this hurt deep in[G]side
Pictures and [D7]memories I feel like crying [G]tonight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I may be crazy but you [G7]know sometimes I can [C]almost feel your touch
[D7]Those who say I should be over you 
[C]Well I guess they just never loved as [G]much 
I put your pictures [G7]where I can't see them
But I'd [C]still see them in my mind
Just like your [G]memories they're right [D7]here with me all the [G]time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Pictures and [C]memories of a love warm and [G]true
Pictures of [D7]love we shared and the memories of [G]you[G7]
But your pictures can't [C]feel my kiss of this hurt deep in[G]side
Pictures and [D7]memories that’s why I’m crying to[G]night
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Pictures and [D7]memories I feel like dying to[C]night [G]
{end_of_verse}
