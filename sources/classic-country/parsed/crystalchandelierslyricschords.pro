{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]All the crystal chandeliers light up the paintings on your [G7]wall
The marble statuettes are standing stately in the [C]hall 
But will the timely crowd that has you laughing loud help you dry your [F]tears
When the [C]new wears off of your [G7]crystal [C]chandeliers
{end_of_verse}

I never did fit in too well with folks you [G7]knew
And it's plain to see that the likes of me don't fit with [C]you
So you traded me for the gaiety of the well to [F]do
And you [C]turned a way from the [G7]love I offered [C]you

I see your picture in the news most [G7]everyday 
You're the chosen girl of the social world  so the stories [C]say  
But a paper smile only last [C]awhile then it fades [F]away
And the [C]love we knew will come [G7]home to you some [C]day
