{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I can't eat and I can't sleep all I [G7]do is sit and cry
And listen for your footsteps at the [C]door
I keep asking myself why we [G7]ever said goodbye
And I guess I've shed a million tears or [C]more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
On my mind on my [G7]mind
You're always in my heart and on my [C]mind
Once I thought my love had died darling [G7]here's what I find
You're always in my heart and on my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Seems I miss you most of all when [G7]twilight shadows fall
What a fool I was to ever let you [C]go
If longing for you now could only [G7]bring you back somehow
You'd be here in these empty arms I [C]know
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
On my mind on my [G7]mind
You're always in my heart and on my [C]mind
Once I thought my love had died darling [G7]here's what I find
You're always in my heart and on my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}
