{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]A poor orphan girl named Maria
Was walking to market one [G7]day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
She stopped for a rest by the roadside
Where a bird with a broken wing [C]lay
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
A few moments passed till she saw it
For its feathers were covered with [G7]sand
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
But soon clean and wrapped it was traveling
In the warmth of Maria's small [C]hand
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
She happily gave her last [F]peso
On a cage made of rushes and [C]twine
She fed it loose corn from the [F]market 
And [C]watched it grow stronger with [G7]time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Now the Christmas Eve service was [C]coming
And the church shone with tinsel and [G7]light
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
And all of the town folks brought presents
To lay by the manager that [C]night
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
There were diamonds and incense and perfumes
In packages fit for a [G7]king
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 9}
But for one ragged bird in a small cage
Maria had nothing to [C]bring
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 10}
She waited till just before [F]midnight
So no one would see [C]her go in
And crying she knelt by the [F]manger
For [C]her gift was unworthy of [G7]Him
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 11}
Then a voice spoke to her through the [C]darkness
Maria what brings you to [G7]Me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 12}
If the bird in the cage is your offering
Open the door let Me [C]see
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 13}
Though she trembled she did as He asked her
And out of the cage the bird [G7]flew
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 14}
Soaring up into the rafters
On a wing that had healed good as [C]new
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 15}
[F]Just then the midnight bells rang out
And the little bird started [C]to sing
A song that no words [F]could recapture
Whose [C]beauty was fit for a [G7]King
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 16}
Now Maria felt blessed just to [C]listen
To that cascade of notes sweet and [G7]long
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 17}
As her offering was lifted to heaven
By the very first nightingale's [C]song
{end_of_verse}
