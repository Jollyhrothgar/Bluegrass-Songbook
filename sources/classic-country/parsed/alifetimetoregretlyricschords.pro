[C]Tonight I'm all alone and broken [F]hearted
A [C]love we knew I never shall [G7]forget

[G7]I've got a lifetime to [C]regret
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
They [F]tell me you are happy with [C]another
I wonder if my memory lingers [G7]yet
The [C]things I said the night we said good[F]bye dear
Oh [G7]I've got a lifetime to [C]regret
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
If we could just erase mistakes we've [F]made dear
I'm [C]sure we could find happy moments [G7]yet
But [C]we can't change the past and I'm [F]afraid dear
That [G7]I've got a lifetime to [C]regret
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I [F]know down in my heart that I'm [C]forgivin'
For I'm just like a fish caught in a [G7]net
I [C]lost the love that made my life worth [F]livin'
[G7]I've got a lifetime to [C]regret
{end_of_verse}
