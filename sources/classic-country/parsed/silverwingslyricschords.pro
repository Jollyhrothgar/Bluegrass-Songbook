{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Silver wings shining in the sunlight
Roaring [Am]engines headed somewhere in [D7]flight
They're taking you away and leaving me [G]lonely
Silver [Am]wings   [D7]slowly fading out of [G]sight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Don't [Am]leave me I [D7]cry
Don't [G]take that [Am]airplane [D7]ride
But you locked me out of [Am]your mind
Left me standing here [D7]behind
