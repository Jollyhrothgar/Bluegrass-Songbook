{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Sign said country music and the [D7]parking lot was full
So I [G7]parked my truck and gave that southern comfort one more [C]pull
Then I walked into that Texas bar [D7]right away I saw
A girl that oughta be against the [G7]law

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Her [C]smile said come on over so I [D7]grabbed a couple a-beers
And [G7]eased up to that fantasy I dreamed about for [C]years
Knew I was a goner when I [D7]looked into her eyes
She [G7]asked if I could two step I said no but I can [C]try
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
She [F]taught me a new step that [C]old Texas two step
[G7]I thought Texas women they were easy to [C]please
But [F]somewhere about dawn well I could [C]see she was gone
And that [G7]gal had Texas two stepped out on [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Now the sign said country music I’m [D7]learning all the songs
My [G7]Texas Cinderella is wherever she [C]belongs
I guess I am the victim of a [D7]hit and run romance 
I [G7]think I’ve got a heartache but at least I’ve learned to [C]dance
