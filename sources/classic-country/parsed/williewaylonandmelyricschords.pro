{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[D7]I heard The Burritos out [F]in California could fly [C]higher than The [G7]Byrds
[Dm]Roger McGuinn had a [F]12-string guitar it was [C]like nothing I'd ever [G7]heard
And The [Am]Eagles flew in from the west [G7]coast 
Like The [Am]Byrds they were trying to be [G7]free
While in [F]Texas the talk turned to [C]Outlaws
Like [G7]Willie and Waylon and [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[D7]Hey well that they say Texas music is in the make
And we've been making music that is [A7]free
[D7]Doin' one night stands and playin' with our [G7]bands
[D7]Willie [A7]Waylon and [D7]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
They say The Beatles were [F]just the beginning of [C]everything music could [G7]be
[D7]Just like The Stones I was [F]rolling along like a [C]ship lost out on the [G7]sea
And [Am]Joplin would die for the [G7]future
And [Am]Dylan would write [G7]poetry
And in [F]Texas the talk turned to [C]Outlaws
Like [G7]Willie and Waylon and [C]me
{end_of_verse}
