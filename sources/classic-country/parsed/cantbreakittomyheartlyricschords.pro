{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I've never felt as helpless [Dm]as I do today
My [F]world just fell around me as I [G7]watched you drive away
And there's [C]nothing left between us some[Em]how we've grown apart
Cause I've [F]got it through my head I just can't [G7]break it to my heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I can't [C]believe this is me on the [Am]hurtin' side of pain
[F]Sifting through the ashes still [G7]tryin' to find a flame
But the [Em]flames have turned to embers left [F]glowing in the [Am]dark
Yes I've [F]got it through my head I just can't [G7]break it to my [C]heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
If I could Lord knows I would spin [Dm]back the hands of time
And [F]piece these scattered memories that are [G7]cluttered in my mind
Pick up [C]where we left off and [Em]make a brand new start
Cause I've [F]got it through my head I just can't [G7]break it to my heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I can't [C]believe this is me on the [Am]hurtin' side of pain
[F]Sifting through the ashes still [G7]tryin' to find a flame
But the [Em]flames have turned to embers left [F]glowing in the [Am]dark
Yes I've [F]got it through my head I just can't [G7]break it to my [C]heart 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Oh I've [F]got it through my head I just can't [G7]break it to my [C]heart
{end_of_verse}
