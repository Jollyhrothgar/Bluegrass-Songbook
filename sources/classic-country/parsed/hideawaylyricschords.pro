[G]I can see the sad expression 
You were [D7]trying to disguise

Hideaway hide[D7]away
In my [G]arms you'll find a [G7]safer place to [C]stay

Where you can [C]hold the world at bay
Come to [D7]me if you just need a hide[G]away

It seems each time you'd meet somebody 
You were [D7]sure your dreams came true
You never stopped to think 
She might not [G]be so good for you

To [C]tell your troubles to
When it's [D7]over come to me and hide[G]away
