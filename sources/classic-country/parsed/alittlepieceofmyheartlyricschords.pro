{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Eve[C]ry [G]time you make me cry 
[C]Can't you see it in my eye
It [D7]tears away a little piece of my [G]heart[C]  [D7]
Now when [G]everything is gone 
[C]And you do another wrong
It [D7]tears away another piece of my [G]heart[C]  [D7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G]Tell me darling must we act like children
[C]And play with love like like some old toy
[D7]For what He gave us 
We should feel tenderness toward one another
[G]Happiness [C]understanding [D7]love and joy
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G]Surely there must be a way
And somehow [C]darling 
Somehow we must find that way
For He would [D7]never forgive us 
And we would never be blessed
[G]With such a love again[C]  [D7]
{end_of_verse}

All I [G]want from life is you 
But [C]each day that we go through
You [D7]tear away a little piece of my [G]heart[C]   [G]
