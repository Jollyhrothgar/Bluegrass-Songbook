[C]A friend of mine came up to me and he [F]said if I could see
All the [C]mighty works of Christ right here [G7]below

And by [C]faith you [G7]surely see if you [C]try

Cause every [F]time the roses bud and every [C]time the rivers flood
Then I know I’ve seen the works of the [G7]Lord

And [C]expect the miracles like the bible [G7]days

And I can [C]see His [G7]works a thousand different [C]ways
