{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]She was on her way out of your life when I found her
Not knowing which way to [G7]turn
{end_of_verse}

She's forgotten the feeling of two arms around her
But it didn't take her long to [C]learn
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
You had new worlds to conquer so you didn't want her
Or [C7]anything cramping your [F]style
But don't she look great in the new dress I bought [C]her
And [G7]don't she look good when she [C]smiles
{end_of_verse}

Did you really think you were so all important
She couldn't get by on her [G7]own
{end_of_verse}

Did you really think losing you would destroy her
And that's why she kept hanging [C]on
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
She stuck to her promise and talked to her conscious
She [C7]did all she could for a [F]while
Then picked up the pieces and she started [C]living
Now [G7]don't she look good when she [C]smiles
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Don't she look good in a new dress I bought her
And the new way that she wears her [G7]hair
{end_of_verse}

She's in a new world and she's not the same girl
She knows now that somebody [C]cares
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 9}
You can't believe that the same girl you let go
Could [C7]change so in this little [F]while
But don't she look great in a new dress I bought [C]her
And [G7]don't she look good when she [C]smiles
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 10}
But don't she look great in a new dress I bought [C]her
And [G7]don't she look good when she [C]smiles
