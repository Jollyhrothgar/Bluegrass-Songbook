{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I wouldn't say you're [C7]always on my [F]mind
I don't [G7]lie awake and want you all the [C]time
Though I couldn't sleep tonight I wasn't [C7]staring at the [F]wall
And for a [G7]minute there I didn't think of you at [C]all
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I bet you think that I'm [C7]not over [F]you
But I [G7]swear that I don't miss you like I used [C]to 
I wasn't sitting here tonight [C7]trying not to [F]call
And [G7]until I did I didn't think of you [C]at [C7]all
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
For a [F]minute there I'm sure you slipped my [C]mind
And there must have been at least [D7]one time 
[G7]I didn't wish that you were mine
[C]And in between every tear you [C7]caused to [F]fall 
There was a [G7]little while I didn't think of you at [C]all
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Yes for a [G7]little while I didn't think of you at [C]all 
{end_of_verse}
