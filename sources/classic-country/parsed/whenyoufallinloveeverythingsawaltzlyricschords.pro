[G]We don't dance the [C]two-step [D7]anymore
All we need's a small part of the [G]floor
The band can go on playing almost [C]anything it [D7]wants
When you fall in love everything's a [G]waltz
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Eyes were meant for looking [C]into real [D7]close
Arms were meant for holding what you want the [G]most
Lips were meant to say what bodies [C]feel down in their [D7]hearts
When you fall in love everything's a [G]waltz

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
We don't hear the music [C]that is being [D7]played
But all we need's the music that our two hearts [G]make
Beating soft three-quarter time and we [C]just sing [D7]along
When you fall in love everything's a [G]waltz
