[C]Pretty soon we're gonna be all alone on [F]our honey[C]moon
In some little secret hideaway place for [G7]two
That's [C]the day you're gonna be all mine on [F]our honey[C]moon
And that's when we'll find [G7]heaven for me and [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I'm gonna [F]love you love you gonna turtle dove you
[C]Squeeze you tease you tell you how I love you
Kiss you like you never been kissed [G7]before
And then we'll [F]walk and talk and spoon neath the moonlight
[C]Arm in arm like lovers on a June night
Then I'll hug and kiss you some [G7]more
I can [C]hardly wait for that happy day it [F]can't be too [C]soon
Till we cuddle and we snuggle on [G7]our honey[C]moon
