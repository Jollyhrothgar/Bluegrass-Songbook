{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I never was the kind to wear my [D7]feelings on my sleeve
But since I've met you girl 
There's been a [G]world of change in me
Well I've got to say I love you 
Hope you [A7]like the sound of that
Cause [D7]I can't keep it under this old [G]hat
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]Under this old hat is the [G]head you turned around
And the [D7]heart you stole away the day we [G]met
[C]Under this old hat's two arms that [Bm]long to hold you [E7]tight
And [A7]boots I'd walk the soles off of to [D7]be here by your side
And [G]every night in my prayers there's [A7]just one thing I ask
That the man you love will [D7]always be under this old [G]hat
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
You've got me feeling things that I've [D7]never felt before
And it's so good to know when I come a [G]knocking at your door
Out of all the men who'd love to waltz 
[A7]Across your welcome mat
The [D7]one you want is under this old [G]hat
{end_of_verse}
