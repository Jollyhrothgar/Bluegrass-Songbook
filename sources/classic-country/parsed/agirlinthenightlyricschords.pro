[G7]The world of make believe that knows no [C]sun or moon or [G7]stars

[G7]Where music's loud she's in the crowd a girl in the [C]night
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]I wonder if she's thinking of dreams that didn't [C]last
[D7]I wonder if she's haunted by heartaches from the [G7]past
[C]Perhaps there is a story of a love that wasn't [F]right
[G7]Now shadows hide her empty pride a girl in the [C]night

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]She's sitting there so lonely as she lights a cigarette
[G7]The smoke rings rise and in her eyes there [C]seems to be [G7]regret

[G7]A glass of wine to pass the time a girl in the [C]night
