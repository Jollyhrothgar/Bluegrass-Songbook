If he [C]knew what your [G7]hand is telling [C]mine

[F]And as they unlock beneath the [C]table
When lips can't say what they want you to [G7]know

[C]And yours just told me [G7]all I need to [C]know
{end_of_verse}

There's [C]no telling what he'd do if we got [G7]up

That's [C]been going on be[G7]neath this table [C]cloth
