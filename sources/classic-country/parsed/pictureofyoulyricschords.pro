{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[D7]It's [G]only a [E7]face in a [Am]frame 
With [D7]lips that have nothing to [G]say[Em]   [D7]
But it's [G]oh so [A#m]important to [Am]me 
Since [A7]he took the real one [D7]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
As I [G]cling to the [E7]frame made of [Am]brass 
And [D7]stare at the angel in [G]glass[Em]   [D7]
I [G]long for the [A#m]love that we [Am]knew 
When [A7]I took this picture of [D7]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Though [G]I've found no [E7]contentment so [Am]rare 
As the [D7]love we were chosen to [G]shar[Em]e  [D7]
The [G]smile on your [A#m]picture will [Am]serve 
To [A7]stay me if I lose my [D7]nerve
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Now [G]I pick up the [E7]wine and the [Am]glass 
And [D7]pour out a toast to the [G]past[Em]   [D7]
[G]Here's to a [A#m]love that we [Am]knew 
Here's [G]to [C]a [D7]picture of [C]you [B7]   [A7]   [G]
{end_of_verse}
