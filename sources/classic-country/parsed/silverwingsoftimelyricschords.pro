{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[Am]The evening [C]sun is sinking moving [G7]homeward
As darkened [Am]shadows claim the fight they [E7]won
With upturned [C]eyes closed from the light of [G7]darkness
And two crossed [Am]hands that [E7]raised another's [Am]son
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Gone oh [C]gone the one who really [G7]loved me
For what I [Am]was not what I ought to [E7]be
Who never [C]questioned falling leaves in [G7]autumn
Nor silver [Am]nests built [E7]on a dying [Am]tree
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
In gingham [C]gown she warmed me from the [G7]coldness
The winter [Am]nights seemed warm as summer[E7]time
Another [C]love will never touch as [G7]deeply
As love that [Am]flew on [E7]silver wings of [Am]time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
On pension [C]for the aged she raised a [G7]young man
Who learned the [Am]love of God and other [E7]things
Now love he [C]knew that twelve times warmed his [G7]winter
Has flown [Am]away on [E7]time's bright silver [C]wings
{end_of_verse}
