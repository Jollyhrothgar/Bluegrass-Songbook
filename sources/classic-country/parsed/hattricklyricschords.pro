[C]You packed up [G7]all my [C]clothes [F]and put 'em by the [C]door
[F]Is this your way of [C]telling me I don't live here any[G7]more
You've [C]gone and called a cab [F]and told me [G7]where to [C]go
Two [F]hearts that used to [C]be on fire have [G7]just gone up in [C]smoke

Now [F]I ain't no ma[C]gician can't [G7]change the way things [C]are

But [F]I can do a [C]hat trick I'll put it [G7]on and disa[C]ppear

You've [C]pulled this [G7]stunt be[C]fore and [F]I kept [G7]holdin' [C]on
But [F]this time when you [C]close the door look [G7]around and I'll be [C]gone

But [F]I can do a [C]hat trick I'll put it [G7]on and disa[C]ppear
