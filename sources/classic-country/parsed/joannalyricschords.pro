{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]The clock on the night stand said [G7]quarter past two
My [F]God my Joanna what’s [G7]happened to you
In [C]trembling silence she [G7]starred at the wall
When [F]she finally spoke it made [G7]no sense at [C]all
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
As [F]I piece together the [C]story she told
It [G7]all became clearer it [C]began to unfold
To [F]see her in prison [C]I can’t stand the pain
So I [G7]made the decision that [F]I’d take the [C]blame
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now the jury said guilty and that [G7]now I must pay
And the [F]judge that passed sentence said [G7]life and a day
Oh [C]life and a day that’s [G7]forever to spend 
For [F]loving Joanna I’m [G7]guilty as [C]sin
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
The [F]cell that I’m in measures [C]4 by 8 feet
The [G7]floor walls and ceiling are [C]made of concrete
Jo[F]anna’s last letter [C]I read everyday
It’s [G7]been over two years now that [F]she passed [C]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
And I’m [G7]still here in prison [F]with life and a [C]day
{end_of_verse}
