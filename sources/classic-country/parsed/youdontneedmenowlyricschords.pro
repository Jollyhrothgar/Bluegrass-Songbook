{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Holdin' on safe[Em]ly to fall 
Like there's no [Am]tomorrow for[C]saking it all
Bound and [F]determined to share all of [Am]our days 
Loving and [D7]learning our special [G7]ways
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
That I'm holdin' [C]onto and you've been lettin' [Em]go
And wherever you've [Am]gone to I'm so far [F]below
You're [C]way over [Em]me I [Am]can't even see [F]how
Some[C]day I'll [G7]need you the [F]way you [G7]don't need me [C]now
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Movin' on [Em]heart in a stall 
Like there's no [Am]tomorrow no [C]beating at all

Reliving and [D7]learning our special [G7]ways
{end_of_verse}

I'm still holdin' [C]onto maybe no lettin' [Em]go
And wherever you've [Am]gone to I may never [F]know

Some[C]day I'll [G7]need you the [F]way you [G7]don't need me [C]now

[Em]And I'm wonder[D7]ing [Em]how I'll [F]be [D7]feeling [G7]when
[C]I'm way [Em]over you [Am]I can't even see [F]how
Some[C]day I'll [G7]need you the [F]way you [G7]don't need me [C]now
{end_of_verse}
