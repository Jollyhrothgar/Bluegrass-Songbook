[D7]I've for[G]gotten your number I hadn't [C]called in a while
And I'm [D7]slowly forgetting your funny little [G]smile

But I've [Am]never stopped [D7]dreaming of [G]you[D7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I've [G]lost all the memories the [C]feel of your touch
And [D7]it's left my mind why I loved you so [G]much
I've even forgotten who [G7]walked out on [C]who
But I've [Am]never stopped [D7]dreaming of [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I've [C]never stopped [Am]seeing your [Bm]face every [Em]night
I [Am]see it each [D7]time that [G]I close my eyes
And [C]times heal that [D7]memories of the [Bm]pain I went [Em]throug[D7]h
But I've [Am]never stopped [D7]dreaming of [G]you[D7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I've [G]misplaced all the trinkets that you [C]told me to keep
And [D7]it's been such a long time since I've lost any [G]sleep
Now I'm doing just fine with [G7]somebody [C]new [G]
But I've [Am]never stopped [D7]dreaming of [G]you
