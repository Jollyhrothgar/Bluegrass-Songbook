{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I was just out of the service thumbing through the classifieds
When an ad that said old Chevy somehow caught [F]my eye
[C]The Lady didn't know the year or even if it ran
But I [F]had that thousand [G7]dollars in my [C]hand
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
It was way back in the corner of this old ramshackle barn
With thirty years of dust and dirt on that green [F]army tarp
And when [G7]I pulled the cover off it took away my [F]breath
What she called a Chevy was a '66 [C][G7]Corvette
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And I felt [Dm]a little guilty as I counted out the [G7]bills
But [C]what a thrill I got when I [F]sat behind the [G7]wheel
[C]I opened up the glove box and that’s when I found the note
The [F]date was 1966 and [G7]this is what he [C]wrote
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
He said my [Am]name is [G7]Private [F]Andrew [G7]Malone
And if [Am]you’re reading [G7]this then I [F]didn't make it [G7]home
But for [Em]every dream that’s [Am]shattered [Dm]another one comes [G7]true
This car [Dm]was once a dream of mine now it belongs to [G7]you
And [Am]though you may [G7]take her and [F]make her your [Em]own
[Dm]You'll always be [G7]riding with Private [C]Malone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Well it didn’t take me long at all I had her running good
I loved to hear those horses thunder [F]underneath her hood
I had her shining like a diamond and I’d [C]put the ragtop down
All [F]the pretty girls would stop and stare as I [G7]drove her through [C]town
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
The [Am]buttons on the radio didn’t seem to work quite [G7]right
But it [C]picked up that oldies show [F]especially late at [G7]night  
I'd get the feelings sometimes if I’d turn real [C]quick I’d see
A [F]soldier riding shotgun in the [G7]seat right next to [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
It was a [Am]young man named [G7]Private [F]Andrew [G7]Malone
Who [Am]fought for his [G7]country and [F]never made it [G7]home
But for [Em]every dream that’s [Am]shattered [Dm]another one comes [G7]true
This car [Dm]was once a dream of his back when it was [G7]new
And [Am]he told me to [G7]take her and [F]make her my [G7]own
[Dm]And I was proud to be [G7]riding with Private [C]Malone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
[F]One night it was raining hard and I took the curve to [G7]fast
[C]I still don’t remember much [F]about that fiery [G7]crash
[C]Someone said they thought they saw a soldier pull me out
They [F]didn’t get his name but I [G7]know without a [C]doubt
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 9}
It was a [Am]young man named [G7]Private [F]Andrew [G7]Malone
Who [C]fought for his [G7]country and [F]never made it [G7]home
But for [C]every dream that’s [G7]shattered [F]another one comes [G7]true
This car [F]was once a dream of his back when it was [G7]new
And I [C]know I wouldn’t [G7]be here if he [F]hadn’t tagged [G7]along
[C]That night I was [G7]riding with Private [C]Malone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 10}
That night I was [G7]rid-ing with Private [C]Malone
