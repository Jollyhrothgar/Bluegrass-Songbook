{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]In every other song that I've heard lately [G7]some fellow gets [C]shot
And his baby and his best friend both die with him [G7]as likely as [C]not
In [F]half of the other songs some Cat's crying [C]or ready to die
We've lost most of our happy people and [G7]I'm wondering [C]why
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Let's think about [G7]living let's think about [C]loving
Let's think about the [G7]whoopin' and hoppin and boppin'
And the lovie lovie [C]dovin' 
Let's [C7]forget about the whinin' and the cryin'
And the shooting and the dying
And the [F]fellow with a switchblade knife
Let's think about [G7]living let's think about [C]life
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
We lost old Marty Robbins down in [G7]El Paso a little while [C]back
And now Miss Patti Page or [G7]one of them is a-wearing [C]black
And [F]Cathy's Clown has Don and Phil where [C]they feel like they could die
If we keep on a-losin' our singers like that 
I'll [G7]be the only one you can [C]buy
