{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]It all started back in 198[Am]1
[D7]Our life together had just [G]begun
[Em]I didn't know what my [A7]future would hold
But you [C]gave me a chance so I [D7]set out on the road
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G]It wasn't easy going [Am]then
There were [D7]times I almost threw that old towel [G]in
[Em]But you kept callin' me [A7]back to the stage
And I [C]finally found my place in [D7]each and every face
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]I'm not sayin' I'm [G]through by any means
There's [Am]still things that I [D7]want to say and [G]do
I [C]hope you won't forget me cause we've [G]shared a lot dreams
And just [Am]know that I'll always [D7]remember [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
When I first set out on the road I figured
I had [Am]maybe five good years to [D7]sing my songs for you folks
Well it's [G]goin' on thirty now
And I still love it just as much as I ever [Em]did
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
When I hear that announcer say [A7]my name
And I walk through those curtains
And [C]see your smilin' faces
My feet don't touch the [G]ground [D7]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Till I walk out and get back on that [G]bus that got me here
I don't know how many more years [Am]I've got left to do this
But I figure a [D7]few I do want you to know though
That when I do walk off this stage for the last [G]time
And I'm all [Em]settled in away from all this you won't be far away
[A7]I'll still hear your screams and cheers in my [C]mind
And I'll [D7]always remember you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
[C]I'm not sayin' I'm [G]through by any means
There's [Am]still things that I [D7]want to say and [G]do
I [C]hope you won't forget me cause we've [G]shared a lot dreams
And just [Am]know that I'll always [D7]remember [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
You've [C]pulled me through some hard times
Hope I've [G]pulled you through a few
And just [Am]know that [C]I'll al[D7]ways remember [G]you
{end_of_verse}
