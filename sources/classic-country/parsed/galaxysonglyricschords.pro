{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[D7]Just re[G]member that you're [D7]standing on a [G]planet that's evolving
Revolving at nine hundred miles an [D7]hour[Am]
It's [D7]orbiting at [Am]nineteen miles a [D7]second so it's [Am]reckoned
A [D7]sun that is the source of all our [G]power
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The sun and you and [Em]me and all the stars that we can [G]see
Are [E7]moving at a million [Am]miles a day
In an [C]outer spiral arm at forty [G]thousand miles an [E7]hour
Of the [A7]Galaxy we [D7]call the Milky [G]Way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Our Galaxy itself contains [Em]100 billion [G]stars
It's 100,000 [Em]light years side to [D7]side
It bulges in the [Am]middle 16,[D7]000 light years [Am]thick
But out by [D7]us it's just 3,000 light years [G]wide
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
We're 30,000 light years from [Em]galactic central [G]point
We go [E7]round every 200 million [Am]years
And our [C]Galaxy is only [A7]one of [G]millions and [E7]billions
In this [A7]amazing and [D7]expanding [G]Universe
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Our universe itself keeps on [Em]expanding and [G]expanding
In all of the [Em]directions it can [D7]whiz
As fast as it can [Am]go the [D7]speed of light you [Am]know
12 [D7]million miles a minute and that's the [G]fastest speed there is
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
So remember when you're feeling very [Em]small and in[G]secure
How [E7]amazingly unlikely is your [Am]birth
And[C] pray that there's intelligent life [G]somewhere up in [E7]space
Cause I'm [A7]afraid that we've been [D7]cheated here on [G]Earth
{end_of_verse}
