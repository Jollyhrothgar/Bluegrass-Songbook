[G7]He lays her [C]picture on the table then he'll [F]reach and pick it up
Be[G7]tween each sip of whiskey just to [C]have another [G7]look

[F]She was [A#7]once his [F]whole world now [C]all that [G7]he's got [C]left
Are [F]whiskey [A#7]soaked old [F]memories and a [C]faded photo[G7]graph
It [C]seems his mind blocks out the time [F]too painful to [Dm]recall
Cause he [C]never got the [G7]picture at [C]all

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
He gazes at the photograph [F]like he don't understand
It [G7]seems as though he doesn't know that she [C]loves another [G7]man

Cause he [C]never got the [G7]picture at [C]all [C7]
