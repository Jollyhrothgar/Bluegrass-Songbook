On five acres of ground I’m in [G7]Georgia

Then a man selling magazines stopped 
And [C7]began talking to my [F]wife  
And before he left there [C]well that man had sold her 
[G7]Twelve months subscriptions to [C]Life

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
On [F]page twenty-five it said all New York was alive and really [C]swinging
Then [F]page 29 it showed a picture of parties and [C]wine with [G7]people [C]singing  
Well it wasn't long until I saved 
A thousand dollar bill from the [G7]harvest
And I had planned to buy more land

She said I’d like to see New York 
What could I say ex[C7]cept to say that’s [F]fine

Oh New York was still alive at 2 am when we arrived Sunday [G7]morning
She said we’d only stay a week 
Cause in seven months our first child would be [C]born

Still the parties and the wild life changed her [F]mind
She begged to be set free I [C]said it just can’t be
In [G7]anger I took my darlings [C]life
