{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[D7]When you're [G]ready for steady to go dancin' romancin'
Grab your sweetheart and jump in your [D7]car
Drive right on down to the bright side of town
And be glad you don't have to drive [G]far
You'll be [D7]happy you don't have to go [G]far
Park your [C]pickups and Cadillacs Fords and Renaults
And [G]dance like the dickens [D7]to the West Texas [G]Waltz [F#m]    [Em]   [D7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Grand[G]mammy grandpappy if you wanna stay happy
You better lace up your best dancin’ [D7]shoes
Come see us don't write us you can stop your arthritis
Just by dancin' away your [G]blues 
[D7]Just by dancin' away your [G]blues
So [C]bind up your bunions with band-aids and gauze
Come [G]dance like the dickens [D7]to the West Texas [G]Waltz [F#m]    [Em]   [D7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I [G]met a fine banker and I'd sure like to thank him
For the credit he gave me made me [D7]shout
He changed my whole attitude and to show my gratitude
I decided I'd just ask him [G]out 
Yes I [D7]thought I just might ask him [G]out
I said [C]close up your windows and lock up your vaults
And [G]dance like the dickens [D7]to the West Texas [G]Waltz [F#m]    [Em]   [D7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
We [G]spent the next to the last dollar in the old ice cream parlor
On a milkshake a malt and a [D7]pop
Then we heard us some sounds there was a honky tonk lounge
Right next to the ice cream [G]shop 
[D7]Next door to the ice cream [G]shop
Now [C]only two things are better than milkshakes and malts
And one is [G]dancin' like the dickens [D7]to the West Texas [G]Waltz [F#m]    [Em]   [D7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
And the [G]other is somethin' but really it's nothin'
To speak of it's somethin' to [D7]do
And if you've done it before you'll be doin' it some more
Just as soon as the dancin' is [G]through 
[D7]Right after the dancin' is [G]through
And if [C]anybody asks you why just tell it's because
You been [G]dancin' like the dickens [D7]to the West Texas [G]Waltz
{end_of_verse}
