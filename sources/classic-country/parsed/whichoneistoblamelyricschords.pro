{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]The nicest thing that's come my way is [G7]you 
But I cannot offer you my heart or [C]name
Oh it isn't fair to do me like you [G7]do 
I [F]wonder which one of us [G7]is to [C]blame
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]Somehow I can't blame myself although I guess I [C]should
And [F]I can't place the blame on you I [D7]wouldn't if I [G7]could
We've [C]made ourselves the gossip of the [G7]town
The things we've done can only bring us [C]shame
We've let our passion drag our honor [G7]down 
I [F]wonder which one of us [G7]is to [C]blame
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Your nearness makes me tremble with [G7]desire  
Your ruby red lips set my soul [C]aflame
But for you I'd be a beggar thief or [G7]liar 
I [F]wonder which one of us [G7]is to [C]blame
