{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I dreamed that the great judgment [F]morning 
Had [C]dawned and the trumpet had [G7]blown
I [C]dreamed that all nations had [F]gathered
To [C]judgment be[G7]fore the white [C]throne
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
From the throne came a bright shining [F]angel
And [C]stood on the land and the [G7]sea
And [C]swore with her hand raised to [F]heaven
That [C]time was no [G7]longer to [C]be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And oh what weeping and [F]wailing
As the [C]lost were told of their [G7]fate
They [C]cried for the rocks and the [F]mountains
They [C]prayed but their [G7]prayers were too [C]late
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
The rich man was there but his [F]money
Had [C]melted and vanished [G7]away
A [C]pauper stood there in the [F]judgment
His [C]debts were too [G7]many to [C]pay
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
The great man was there but his [F]greatness
When [C]death came was left far [G7]behind
The [C]angel that opened the [F]records
No [C]trace of his [G7]greatness could [C]find
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
The widow was there and the [F]orphan
God [C]heard and remembered their [G7]cries
No [C]sorrow in heaven for[F]ever
God [C]wiped all the [G7]tears from their [C]eyes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
The gambler was there and the [F]drunkard
And [C]they who had sold them the [G7]drink
With [C]people who gave them the [F]license
To[C]gether in [G7]hell they did [C]sink
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And oh what weeping and [F]wailing
As the [C]lost were told of their [G7]fate

They [C]prayed but their [G7]prayers were too [C]late
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
The mortal man to the [F]judgment
But [C]self righteousness would not [G7]do
For [C]the men who had crucified [F]Jesus
Had [C]passed off as [G7]mortal men [C]too
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 9}
And the souls that had put off sal[F]vation
Not [C]tonight I'll get saved by and [G7]by
No [C]time now to think of [F]religion
But at [C]last they [G7]found time to [C]die
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And oh what weeping and [F]wailing
As the [C]lost were told of their [G7]fate

They [C]prayed but their [G7]prayers were too [C]late
{end_of_verse}
