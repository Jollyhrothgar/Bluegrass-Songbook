{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Dear Uncle Sam I [D7]know you're a busy [G]man
And tonight I write to you through [A7]tears with a trembling [D7]hand
[G]My darling answered when he [D7]got that call from [G]you
You [C]said you really [G]need him but you don't [D7]need him like I [G]do

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Don't misunderstand I know he's [D7]fighting for our [G]land
I really love my country but I [A7]also love my [D7]man
He [G]proudly wears the colors of the [D7]old red white and [G]blue
While [C]I wear a [G]heartache since [D7]he left me for [G]you

Dear Uncle Sam I just got your telegram
And I can't believe that this is me shaking like I am
For it said I'm sorry to inform you
