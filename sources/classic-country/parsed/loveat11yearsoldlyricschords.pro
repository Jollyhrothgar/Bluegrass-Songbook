{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I fell in love at 11 years old 
To the nicest girl in [G7]school
Though tongue tied and bashful and painfully shy
I hope that she loves me [C]too
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Everyday after school I'd go stand by her gate
Cheerfully braving the [G7]cold
Hoping to get just one glimpse of the girl that I love
That's eleven years [C]old
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]Love at eleven will [C]live on forever
[G7]Memories worth more than [C]gold
[F]Can anyone truthfully [C]say it's forgotten
This [G7]love at eleven years [C]old
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I saved up my money to buy a big heart
Full of candy for Valentines [G7]day
And proudly I marched to her front door and rang
With a heart I was giving [C]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
She opened the door and her mouth couldn't speak
But I saw the love in her [G7]eyes
And I knew as I silently handed my heart to her
This was her greatest sur[C]prise
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]Love at eleven will [C]live on forever
[G7]Memories worth more than [C]gold
[F]Can anyone truthfully [C]say it's forgotten
This [G7]love at eleven years [C]old
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Time was a thing that made wedding bells ring
We took a big step in our [G7]lives
I was so happy all dressed for the wedding
The day she became my young [C]bride
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Something between us kept us together 
A love that never grows [G7]cold
She knows I love her and I will forever
Like I did at eleven years [C]old
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]Love at eleven will [C]live on forever
[G7]Memories worth more than [C]gold
[F]Can anyone truthfully [C]say it's forgotten
This [G7]love at eleven years [C]old
{end_of_verse}
