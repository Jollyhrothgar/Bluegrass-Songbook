{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Flashing dark eyes has [G7]Carlena laughter so pleasant to [C]hear
[G7]The wind in the trees sighed Carlena
[C]I've not seen her for almost a year
[F]I'll cross the river at Waco and then I’ll ride like the [G7]wind
[C]I'll change horses at the rancho of Jose [G7]Gomez my good [C]friend
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G7]Ruby red lips has Carlena red as the rose in her [C]hair
[G7]To be in the arms of Carlena is a pain in my heart I can't [C]bear
[F]I see the lights of the rancho but who's standing there in the [G7]door
[C]Carlena and Jose embracing oh [G7]who can you trust [C]anymore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G7]I stood in the shadows a moment watched Jose kissing my [C]wife
[G7]They'll bury him in the morning he'll pay for that kiss with his [C]life
[F]My hand went quick for my pistol the bullet went straight for his [G7]head
[C]But he moved the very same moment [G7]and it reached Carlena [C]instead
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[G7]Before Jose knew what had happened one more shot rang out in the [C]dark
[G7]I knew by the way he was falling the bullet had went to his [C]heart
[F]Now I got no reason for living so I'll just ride on to [G7]Juarez
[C]And I'll drink till I can't remember [G7]Carlena and Jose [C]Gomez
{end_of_verse}
