[D7]I still know where to go from here

Cause [G]I know the way by a broken heart
Where the honky tonk [D7]healing starts
A dance floor and a country band
Will put me back on my feet [G]again

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
A [D7]warm shoulder and a [G]slow two step

I [D7]know the way by a [G]broken heart

I [D7]bet she thinks I'm gonna [G]call her up
