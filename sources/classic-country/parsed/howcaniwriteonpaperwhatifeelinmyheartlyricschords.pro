[C]With pen in hand I try to write this note to [G7]you

[G7]How can I write on paper what I'm feeling deep [C]inside

[C7]A love as sweet as yours and mine deserves another [F]start
[G7]How can I write on paper what I feel in my [C]heart

[G7]Those simple things you gave are worth the world to me
[C]And each of them I claim you can't take memories

[G7]How can I write on paper what I feel in my [C]heart
{end_of_verse}
