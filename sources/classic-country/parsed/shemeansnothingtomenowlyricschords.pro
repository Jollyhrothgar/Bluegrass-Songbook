{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Go ahead and call her if you want [G7]to
She and I aren't tied by any [C]vows
Just do as you [C7]please  if it puts your mind at [F]ease
[G7]She means nothing to me [C]now
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I confess that she used to be my [G7]baby
But we just couldn't get along [C]somehow
So go on and make your call  it won't bother me at [F]all
[G7]She means nothing to me [C]now
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The [F]only time I ever think about [C]her
Is when I'm alone or with somebody [G7]else
I [F]make believe that I can live without [C]her
[D7]But I'm not fooling no one but [G7]myself
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]I know the masquerade won't last [G7]forever
But I'll act as long as my heart will [C]allow
I'm just lying when I say  for in every scene I [F]play
[G7]She means nothing to me [C]now
{end_of_verse}
