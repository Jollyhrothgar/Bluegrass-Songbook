{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I was standing by my window yesterday [D7]morning
Without a thought of worry or of [G]care
When I saw a [G7]postman coming up the [C]pathway
With [D7]such a happy face and jolly [G]air
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
He rang the bell and whistled as he [D7]waited
And then he said good morning to you [G]Jack
But he little knew [G7]the sorrow that he [C]brought me
As he [D7]handed me a letter edged in [G]black
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
With trembling hand I took that letter [D7]from him
I broke the seal and this is what it [G]said
Come home my boy your [G7]dear old father [C]wants you
Come [D7]home my boy your dear old mother's [G]dead
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
The last words your mother ever [D7]uttered
Were tell my boy I want him to come [G]back
My eyes are blurred my [G7]poor old heart is [C]breaking
While I'm [D7]writing you this letter edged in [G]black
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I bowed my head in sorrow and in [D7]silence
The sunshine of my life it all had [G]fled
Since the postman brought [G7]that letter yesterday [C]morning
Come [D7]home my boy your dear old mother's [G]dead
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Those angry words I wish I'd never [D7]spoken
You know I did not mean them don't you [G]Jack
May the angels bear [G7]this message I am [C]sending
Your [D7]forgiveness in this letter edged in [G]black
{end_of_verse}
