[G]Play me something nice and easy
Let the music be an [G7]old familiar [C]friend
Help me [D7]hold this pretty lady tight
Play that good old hurtin' song [G]again

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I heard you say it's closing time
I'm sure you're tired you played a lot [D7]tonight
It's takin' me this long but that old beer would let me down enough
To get a cheatin' woman off my [G]mind

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I'm sure by now you’ve heard enough
Stories like the ones I put you [D7]through
But if you could play me one more song the one about a love gone wrong
I'll find the way to make it up to [G]you
