{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]My mind knows full well I should leave [C]here
[D7]But my heart my foolish heart will not [G]turn
She fills me with a crazy wild [C]desire
And lying [G]helpless I [D7]know just how I'll [G]burn
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Back in the [D7]fire  where my [C]heart must long to [G]be
If it wasn't so then why [A7]oh why does it keep dragging [D7]me
Back in the [C]fire  to the [G]flames of [C]ecstasy
I guess I'll [G]always love  [D7]the way she burns in [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
At times I've gone as far as [C]believing
[D7]This tortured soul of mine was finally [G]free
Then those long silent leftover [C]feelings
Say I'm a [G]pretender and I'll [D7]surrender [G]willingly
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Back in the [D7]fire  where my [C]heart must long to [G]be
If it wasn't so then why [A7]oh why does it keep dragging [D7]me
Back in the [C]fire  to the [G]flames of [C]ecstasy
I guess I'll [G]always love  [D7]the way she burns in [G]me
