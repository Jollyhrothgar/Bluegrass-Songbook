{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Daddy was working on the pipeline [C]up in [G]Pittsburg
[D7]Brother was off in Asia fightin' some fool [G]war
[C]Late one night momma came down with a real fierce [G]hurting
[D7]We had no phone and the doctor lived too [G]far
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]I said momma I reckon I'd best go fetch the [G]neighbor
[D7]She said I'll be all right there ain't no [G]need
[C]But she kept on gettin' worse instead of [G]better
[D7]With a feverish look she pleaded up at [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]She said son run to the spring and get some [G]water
[C]To cool your momma's parched and thirsting [D7]lips
[G]Cause I believe some good [C]cool clear spring [G]water
[D7]Will make this awful fever lose its [G]grip
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]I said momma there's good cold water in the [G]icebox
[D7]I fetched it up fresh late this [G]afternoon
[C]She said son now you be good and mind your [G]momma
[D7]Cause that water in the icebox just won't [G]do
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[C]So I ran down to the spring to fetch some [G]water
[C]She was crying as I softly shut the [D7]door
[G]And when I got back to [C]the house with good clear [G]water
[D7]My momma wasn't thirsty [G]any [D7]more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
[G]Through the years I've come [C]to understand and [G]value
[D7]The courage in my momma's gentle [G]soul
[C]And how she chose to bare her cross alone and spare [G]me
[D7]From watchin' the grim reaper take his [G]toll
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
[C]She said son run to the spring and fetch some [G]water
[C]She was crying as I softly shut the [D7]door
[G]Now she's gone where there'll [C]always be good cool [G]water
[D7]And she'll never thirst for anything [C]no [G]more
{end_of_verse}
