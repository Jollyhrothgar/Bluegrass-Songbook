{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]This highway of heartache is [F]rocky and [C]rough
And I learned a [G7]long time [C]ago
You can't build a fire from the ashes [F]of [C]love 
And roses don't [G7]bloom in the [C]snow
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Down deep inside my [F]soul
Where [C]once it was cold and [G7]dark 
I can [C]feel your [F]love take a [C]hold
Way down [G7]deep in my [C]soul
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
You were my light in the [F]darkest of [C]days
Though storm clouds were [G7]raging [C]within
Slowly but surely the [F]clouds rolled [C]away
And the sun started [G7]shining [C]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Down deep inside my [F]soul
Where [C]once it was cold and [G7]dark 
I can [C]feel your [F]love take a [C]hold
Way down [G7]deep in my [C]soul
{end_of_verse}
