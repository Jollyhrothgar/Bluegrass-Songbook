{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]You take me out in splendor then go [F]home to her
[G7]Whisper words so tender then [F]go home to [C]her
Though the things we do are wrong [F]I'm not sure I can go on
How [G7]can you leave me here alone then go [C]home to her
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You take me out with all your friends then [F]go home to her
[G7]And that's when all the hurt begins [F]while you're [C]home with her
I must be brave so I won't cry [F]but I think I'll surely die
[G7]Every time you say that I must go [C]home to her
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
You take me home and then you're [F]gone home to her
[G7]I'm left to face the night alone [F]while you're [C]home with her
If you never will be free [F]why must all this torture be
If [G7]you can't always be with me then go [C]home to her
{end_of_verse}
