{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G7]We [C]said our goodbyes I watched her board the plane
As she [Am]taxied down the runway I felt a pain
That brought me [F]to my knees[G7]
[F]All the times before we [C]seemed to work it out
But as I [Dm]watched her plane [Em]disappear 
It [F]left me with no [G7]doubt
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
She's [C]gone into the night [Am]gone out of my [F]life
And I'm here [G7]alone
My [C]tears kept falling down 
As [Am]her plane left the ground
[F]I watched a flame go [G7]dark
[F]Faster than speed of [Dm]flight 
My [G7]world fell a[C]part[G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
There's [C]times that I'd swear she's right next to me
Sometimes [Am]I smell her perfume in the evening breeze
It still [F]tears me up[G7]
They say [F]everything in time 
Well that [C]remains to be seen
Then a [Dm]clock clicking [Em]double time 
[F]Wouldn't change a [G7]thing
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
She's [C]gone into the night [Am]gone out of my [F]life
And I'm here [G7]alone
My [C]tears kept falling down 
As [Am]her plane left the ground
[F]I watched a flame go [G7]dark
[F]Faster than speed of [Dm]flight 
My [G7]world fell a[C]part[G7]
