{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I watched from my window as she [F]slipped from the [C]house
Once again she’s leaving but Lord she’s not the [G7]blame
This [C]morning a memory phoned her he’s a habit [F]she can’t break
So till [C]she returns I’ll [F]wait for [C]her 
[G7]Looking out my window through [C]the pain
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The [F]devil drove the taxi that carried her [C]away
And it [G7]hurts to know she’s still hung up on some [F]guy from [C][G7]yesterday
Once [F]again she’s chasing memories and I’m losing [C]everything
But [F]lord I [C]love her so I’ll [F]wait for [C]her 
[G7]Looking out my window through [C]the pain
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I’ll pick up the pieces when he [F]lets her down [C]again
With love and understanding I’ll give her reasons this time to [G7]stay
And [C]I’ll close my eyes pretending maybe someday she will [F]change
[C]Then I won’t be left [C][F]lonely           
[G7]Looking out my window through the [C]pain
