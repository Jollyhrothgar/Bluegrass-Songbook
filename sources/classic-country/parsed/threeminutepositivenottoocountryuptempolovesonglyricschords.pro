Three Minute Positive Not Too Country 
Up-Tempo Love Song
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G]This is three minute song to tell her that I love her 
And how wonderful we get along
A sweet sentiment that's borderline slick  
A [A7]lotta right and not much [D7]wrong
It's a [G]little bit edgy but softer than spaghetti 
Weak yet redundantly [C]strong
It's a [G]three minute positive 
[D7]Not too country up-tempo [G]love song
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Yeah it's a [C]three minute positive 
Not too country up-tempo [G]love song
It's a [C]way for me to tell her that I love her 
But it can't be [D7]too long
There'll [G]be no drinking no cheatin' 
No lyin' no leavin' that stuff it just don't [C]belong
In a [G]three minute positive 
[D7]Not too country up-tempo [G]love song
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
You won't hear four-letter words just me tellin' her
That she's the every breath I draw
And how I can't live without her 
And I could never doubt her
[A7]Cause she could never do no [D7]wrong
Well it's the [G]right amount of timin' 
The proper form of rhymin'
A little guitar then it's [C]gone
It's a [G]three minute positive 
[D7]Not too country up-tempo [G]love song
