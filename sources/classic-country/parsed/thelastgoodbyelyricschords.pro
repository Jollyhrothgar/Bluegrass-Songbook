{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]We had promised to be [C7]wed when we [F]said goodbye that [D7]night
While the [G7]moon and stars were shining from the [C]sky
For our hearts were full of [C7]joy and the [F]future looked so [D7]bright
I never [G7]thought that we were sayin' our last good[C]bye
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I was only leaving [C7]you for [F]just a little [D7]while
To find a [G7]home where we'd be happy by and [C]by
Then you kissed me with a [C7]smile and you [F]said you'd wait for [D7]me
I never [G7]thought that we were sayin' our last good[C]bye
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
It was only one short [C7]year till I [F]found a little [D7]place
And started [G7]home to you to hear your happy [C]sigh
I was thinking only [C7]of the [F]smile upon your [D7]face
I never [G7]thought that we had said our last good[C]bye
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Oh the story that was [C7]told when I [F]knocked upon your [D7]door
Broke my [G7]heart in two and how it made me [C]cry
For that told me you had [C7]gone and didn't [F]love me any[D7]more
And then I [G7]knew that we had said our last good[C]bye
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
No one never can be [C7]told what the [F]hand of fate will [D7]deal
And we [G7]do not know the time that we will [C]die
So don't ever be too [C7]sure that your [F]love is always [D7]real
You'll never [G7]know the sadness of our last good[C]bye
{end_of_verse}
