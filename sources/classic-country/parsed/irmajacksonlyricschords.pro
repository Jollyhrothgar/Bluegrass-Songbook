{meta: title Irma Jackson}
{meta: artist Merle Haggard}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I'd love to shout my feelin's from a mountain high
Tell the [G7]world I love her and I will till I die
There's no way the world will understand that love is color blind
That's why Irma Jackson can't be [C]mine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I remember when no one cared about us bein' friends
We were only children and it [G7]really didn't matter then
But we grew up too quickly in a world that draws a line
Where they say Irma Jackson can't be [C]mine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
If my [F]lovin' Irma Jackson is a sin
Then I don't under[G7]stand this crazy world we're livin' in
There's a muddy wall between us standin' high
But I'll love Irma Jackson till I [C]die
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
She tells me she's decided that she'll go away
And I guess it's right but she alone [G7]should have the final say
But in spite of her decision forcin' us to say goodbye
I'll still love Irma Jackson till I [C]die
{end_of_verse}
