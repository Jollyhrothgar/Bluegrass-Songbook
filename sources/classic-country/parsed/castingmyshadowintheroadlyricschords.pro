{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]There was a warm wind [G7]weaving [C]through the trees
It was an [F]early [G7]breath of [C]spring
Like a [Am]young bird [G7]soon to [F]leave its nest
I [G7]yearn to spread my wings
Though the [C]teardrops fell like a morning rain
I [G7]knew I had to [Am]go 
I had [F]always dreamed of
[C]Casting my [G7]shadow in the [C]road 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I couldn't count the [G7]times I [C]said goodbye
To a [F]city [G7]limit [C]sign
Or the [Am]countless [C]sweet and [F]gentle farms
And the [G7]towns I've left behind
Oh but [C]passion rides on the prairie winds
And [G7]recent winter [Am]snow 
And [F]I still dream of
[C]Casting my [G7]Shadow in the [C]road
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
When the evening comes I often stop
To [F]rest my weary [C]feet
But when the morning sun begins to rise
And I [F]feel the urge to [G7]leave
A [Am]night of rest [Dm]fans the flame
That [F]burns with[G7]in my [Am]soul[C] 
A [F]burning need for 
[C]Casting my [G7]shadow in the [C]road
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
When the evening comes I often stop
To [F]rest my weary [C]feet
But when the morning sun begins to rise
And I [F]feel the urge to [G7]leave
A [Am]night of rest [Dm]fans the flame
That [F]burns with[G7]in my [Am]soul[C] 
A [F]burning need for 
[C]Casting my [G7]shadow in the [Am]road
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
A [F]burning need for
[C]Casting my [G7]shadow in the [C]road
