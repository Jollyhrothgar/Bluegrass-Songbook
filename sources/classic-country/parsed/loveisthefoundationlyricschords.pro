{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I've seen her as she awakens [C]in the [G]morning
She reaches out her hand and without a [D7]word
As [G]her fingers softly [C]fall upon my [G]body
She [C]lights the flame of desire [D7]and makes me want [G]her
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And love is the [C]foundation we lean [G]on 
All you need is love to ease your [D7]mind
[G]And does it have to be [C]right to be called [G]love
When [C]she gives me more [D7]loving 
Than a [C]lifetime of [D7]looking could ever [G]find
