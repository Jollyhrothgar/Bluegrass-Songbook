{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Just another [C]stranger in a [G]lonesome town
One more lonely night without a [D7]home
I can't [G]sleep for looking [C]back on all the [G]wasted years
I've lived a [C]life that's [D7]going going [G]gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
When I was young I [C]gave myself to the [G]reckless life
Met trouble along the way at every [D7]turn
Always [G]searching for some [C]peace to feed my [G]restless soul
Never [C]cared 'bout the [D7]bridges I always [G]burn

The fields of discon[C]tent have never [G]let me down

When it's [C]all said and [D7]done I'll be [G]alone
