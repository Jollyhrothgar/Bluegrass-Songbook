{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]There's a little mountain church in my thoughts of [F]yesterday
Where [C]friends and family gathered for the [G7]Lord
There an old [C]fashioned preacher taught the straight and narrow [F]way
For what you [C]call the congregation [G7]could [C]afford

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Dressed in all our Sunday best we sat on pews of solid [F]oak
And I [C]remember how our voices filled the [G7]air
How momma sounded [C]like an angel on those high soprano [F]notes
When the [C]roll is called up [G7]yonder I'll be [C]there
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Looking back now that little mountain church [F]house
Has [C]become my life's corner [G7]stone
It was [C]there in that little mountain church [F]house
I first [C]heard the word I've [G7]based my life [C]upon
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
At the all day Sunday singing and dinner on the [F]ground
[C]Many were the souls that were [G7]revived
While my [C]brothers and my sisters who've gone on to glory [F]land
Slept in [C]piece in the maple [G7]grove [C]nearby
{end_of_verse}
