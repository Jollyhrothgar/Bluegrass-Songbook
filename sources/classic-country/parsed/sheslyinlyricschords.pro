{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G7]As her key unlocks the front [C]door
[Am]I reach out to find a light so she can [Em]see
[Dm]Then I wait to hear her story
[G7]Why she stayed out late tonight and [C]she tells [F]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[Dm]That it really wasn't her fault
[G7]If she'd had her way she'd have been home hours [F][C]ago
[Dm]That's when her tears start to flowin'
[F]And she swears it's true but in my heart I [G7]know
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]When I'm sure that I've convinced her
[Am]That I believe her story then I turn [Em]away
[Dm]I don't let her know she's hurt me
[G7]Cause the words stick in my throat I wanna [F][C]say
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[Dm]And I'm so afraid I'll lose her
[G7]If she knew I knew the truth she just might [F][C]go
[Dm]So I listen to her story
[F]Try to hide the hurt but in my heart [Dm][G7]I [G7]know
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[C]She's lying there's not a word of truth in her [Em]crying
[F]And still I've got this awful urge
[Dm]To take her in my arms and hold [G7]her [G7][Dm]tight
[C]God I know she's lying a little more of me keeps on [Em]dying
[Dm]Oh how I wish that I could be the [G7]one that she's been lyin' with [C]tonight
[Dm]Instead of me I'd rather be the one [G7]that she's been lyin' with [G]tonight
[G7]She's [C]lying
{end_of_verse}
