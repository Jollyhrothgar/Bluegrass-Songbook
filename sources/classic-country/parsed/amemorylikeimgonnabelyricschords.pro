{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I can hear you smiling on the [Em]phone 
[F]Bet you thought that I'd be [C]crying 
Go on and tell yourself I've done you [Em]wrong 
But we [F]both know you'll be [G7][Am]ly-ing
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[Dm]You don't have to have a [Em]reason 
If your [F]heart is set on [G7]leaving 
[C]But you'll remember on some rainy [Em]day 
A little simple word or [F]thought 
Or a birthday card [G7]I bought
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Just [C]surrender cause you can't get [Em]away 
You [Dm]never can be [F]free 
From a [G7]memory like I'm gonna [C]be 
That greener grass you think you [Em]see 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Is just a high [F]heeled [C]illusion 
Better count the cost of being [Em]free 
Is it [F]worth all that you're [G7][Am]lo-sing 
[Dm]It may be over but it's not [Em]ending 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[F]Cause there's one thing you're [G7]forgetting 
You'll [C]remember on some rainy [Em]day 
Little things we used to [F]do 
Like that night in Baton [G7]Rouge 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Just [C]surrender cause you can't get [Em]away 
You [Dm]never can be [F]free 
From a [G7]memory like I'm gonna [C]be 
[Dm]When it all comes back someday 
[Em]Don't be surprised on some lonely [F]night 
[G7]When you close your eyes 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Just [C]surrender cause you can't get [Em]away 
You [Dm]never can be [F]free 
From a [G7]memory like I'm gonna [C]be
{end_of_verse}
