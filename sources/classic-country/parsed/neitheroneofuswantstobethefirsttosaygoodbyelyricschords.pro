Neither One Of Us 
(Wants To Be The First To Say Goodbye)
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]It's sad to think that we're not gonna [Dm]make it [G7]
And it's [Dm]gotten to the point that [C]we just can't fake it [G7]
But [C]for some ungodly [Em]reason   [C]we just won't let it [F]die[D7]
I guess [C]neither one of us  [G7]wants to be the first to say good[C]bye [G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I keep [C]wondering what I'll do with[Dm]out you [G7]
And I [Dm]guess you must be wondering that [C]same thing too
So we go on to[Em]gether  [C]just living a [F]lie [D7]
Because [C]neither one of us  [G7]wants to be the first to say good[C]bye
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[F]Every time I find the nerve to say [C]that I'm leaving
Old [G7]memories seem to get in my [C]way [C7]
Oh [F]Lord knows it's only me that [C]I'm deceiving
[D7]Cause when it comes to saying goodbye
That's a simple word I [G7]never could say
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[C]There can be a way this can have a [Dm]happy ending [G7]
But [Dm]we can't go on  [C]hurting and pretending [G7]
[C]So let's convince our[Em]selves to give it [C]give it one more [F]try [D7]
Because [C]neither one of us  [G7]wants to be the first to say good[F]by[C]e
