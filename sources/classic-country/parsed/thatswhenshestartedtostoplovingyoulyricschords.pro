[C]Does she seem a little [F]cold when you [C]love her

Just search your soul and [F]you will [C]discover
How you hurt her [F]night after [C]night 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And when was the [F]first time she [Gm]begged you to [F]love her 
But you turned away and# acted like a[C] fool 
And when was the [F]first time she [C]laid there and cried 
Well that's when she [F]started to stop loving [C]you 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Do you wonder why she's [F]turning to [C]another 
And if you love her you'd [F]better tell her [C]so

And it won't be long till you'll [F]have to let her [C]go
