{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Riches do not come in silver and in [F]gold

But [G7]now there's only memories left [C7][C]behind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]If you never lost a loved [C]one
[F]Then you'll know just what I [G7]mean
For what [F]good are treasures and a [C]kingdom
If you're a [G7]king without a [C]queen
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now that she has gone and found another [F]love
My [G7]castle is empty and so [C]cold
For her leaving brought me heartaches that I have never [F]known
And [G7]there's sadness in the treasures I now [C7][C]hold
{end_of_verse}
