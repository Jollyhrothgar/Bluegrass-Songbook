[C]Way down in [Am]Sad Town in the [F]valley of broken [C]dreams 
We're both prisoners of [Am]past loves 
And [F]things that'll never [G7]be 
Something [C]tells me if [Am]you held me 
The [F]clouds would disa[C]ppear 
We could leave our troubles [Am]all behind 
And [F]nothing could [G7]keep us [C]here

We could soar like an [A#7]eagle touch the [Am]sky like a [F]dove
We could [C]fly to the top of the [Am]world and [A#7]fly into [Dm]love 
[A#7]F---[F]ly into [C]love 
{end_of_verse}

Sunshine [Am]all the time is [F]just beyond the [C]hill 
True love is [Am]waiting there and [F]we can find it [G7]still

Let's put our dreams [Am]together now and [F]fly [G7]away [C]tonight
