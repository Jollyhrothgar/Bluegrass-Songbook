{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Another night has found me on the [G7]road to wrong again
My weakness will be waiting for me at the other [C]end
She'll welcome me with hungry arms and [G7]turn the lights down low
And [F]play like she be[C]longs to me [F]until it's [G7]time to [C]go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Play now [G7]pay later
My heart begs me to turn the other [C]way
Play now [G7]pay later
Is the [F]game that I am [G7]playin' worth the price I'll have to [C]pay
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I'm not sure which one of us is [G7]you that leads me on
I only know your arms have always made me feel at [C]home
I'm gettin' closer to the point of [G7]no return I know
Cause [F]each time it's gettin' [C]harder for my [F]arms to [G7]let you [C]go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Play now [G7]pay later
My heart begs me to turn the other [C]way
