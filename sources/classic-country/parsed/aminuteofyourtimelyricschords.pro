It would [D7]only take a minute of your [G]time

[Em]Part of your [Am]time each [A7]day so think of [D7]me

One [G]minute of your time 
Is all it [Em]takes to bring us close
When we are [Am]far apart

I know that there's a chance you'll find
I'm right there [G]in your heart
{end_of_verse}

Until [C]that moment you are back to [D7]stay

Every [D7]minute of your [G]time
