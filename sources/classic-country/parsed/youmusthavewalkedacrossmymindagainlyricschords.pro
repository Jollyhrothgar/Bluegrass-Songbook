{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I woke-up down town in [F]jail again this [C]morning
They say that I went half crazy with [G7]the booze  
Then they [C]hit me one more time [F]for no [C]reason  
But they can't hurt me not [G7]half as much [C]as you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You must have walked [F]across my mind [C]again
I don't recall what I've done or where [G7]I've been
I was [C]holding my own then [F]everything went [C]wrong
You must have walked [G7]across my mind [C]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
 That old jukebox won't be playing [F]my favorite song no [C]more
The bottle that I threw knocked out [G7]its lights
They [C]say I damaged everything [F]I put my hands [C]upon
And one man might not [G7]make it through the [C]night
{end_of_verse}

You must have walked [G7]across my mind [C]again
