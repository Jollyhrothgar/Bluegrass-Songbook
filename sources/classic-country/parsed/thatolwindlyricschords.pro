[C]She dropped her boy at [G7]school on [C]time 
One less [Am]worry on her mind
[F]Now it's off to work and [C]on the radi[G7]o

Her eyes well up with tears 
God could it [Am]be it's been ten years
Since that [F]autumn night out[C]side the county [G7]fair

That to this [F]day is still [G7]alive and burning [C]there

{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
The marquee misspelled his name 
And not too [Am]many people came

They laughed and [C]loved all through the night 
And as they [Am]faced the morning light
They [F]found themselves [G7]standing there [C]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[Am]And he asked her [F]twice to come [G7]along

With him [Am]standing by her side
That ol' [F]wind had once [G7]again found its way [C]home

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
[Am]Someday he'll [F]tell her about the [C]money he hid
[Am]And someday she'll [F]tell him that the [C]boy is his [G7]kid
For right [C]now they're both in love 
The only [Am]thing they're thinking of
Is that they're [F]finally where their [G7]hearts have always [C]been
