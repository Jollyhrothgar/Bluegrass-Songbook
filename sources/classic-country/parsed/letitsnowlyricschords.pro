{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Oh the weather outside [G7]is [C]frightful
But the fire is so [G7]delightful,
And [Dm]since we've no [A7]place to [Dm]go
Let it [G7]snow let it snow let it [C]snow
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
It doesn't show signs [G7]of [C]stopping
And I brought some corn for [G7]popping
The [Dm]lights are turned [A7]way down [Dm]low
Let it [G7]snow let it snow let it [C]snow
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
When we finally kiss good [G7]night
How I'll [Am]hate going [D7]out in the [G7]storm
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
But if you really hold me tight
[A7]All the way [D7]home I'll be [G7]warm
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
The [C]fire is [G7]slowly [C]dying
And my dear we're still [G7]good-bye-ing
But as [Dm]long as you [A7]love me [Dm]so
Let it [G7]snow let it snow let it [C]snow
{end_of_verse}
