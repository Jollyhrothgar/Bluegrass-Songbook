{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]There was a time we'd sit in the backyard cause the house would get so hot
From the summer sun there was no way of [Am]sleepin'[D7]
And you'd [Am]play your old gui[D7]tar we'd fight [Am]mosquitos and [D7]enjoy
Your backyard [Am]concerts for we [D7]had no tele[G]vision
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
We'd just begun our life as man and wife and hard ships then
Could scarcely scare us into [Am]quittin'[D7]
Things were [Am]far from bein' [D7]fine we often [Am]dined upon a [D7]dime
There [Am]never was a [D7]time we didn't [G]love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The Christmas brought us saddest days when your pride 
Gave a way you told the kids there'd be no gifts cause we were [Am]broke[D7]
Though their [Am]little tears of [D7]grief was so [Am]hard to see it [D7]didn't hurt me
[Am]Like the lump I [D7]knew was in your [G]throat
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
It was then with arms entwined we both broke down and cried
For it seemed like nothing good would ever [Am]come [D7]
The doctor [Am]bills we couldn't [D7]pay they came and [Am]took our car [D7]away
There [Am]never was a [D7]time we didn't [G]love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Now there's an easy chair for my back and satin pillows for your head
And the kids are wild about the brand new [Am]cars[D7]
You and [Am]I can order [D7]steak with all the [Am]trimmings and not [D7]worry
If we've [Am]spent a dollar [D7]more than we could [G]spare
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
No wonder in your prayers we've thanked the Man upstairs who led us through
The years of ragin' kids and payin' [Am]bills[D7]
And I [Am]think He guided [D7]us not because [Am]we were smart but [D7]just because
There [Am]never was a [D7]time we didn't [G]love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
There [Am]never was a [D7]time [Am]never was a [D7]time [Am]never was a [D7]time we didn't [G]love
