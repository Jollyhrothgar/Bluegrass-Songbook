[G]Put one out light one up pour [C]myself another [G]cup
Of the memories that keep me hanging [D7]on

God I hate to spend [D7]another night [G]alone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And I'll hear [C]pictures on the wall I'll hear [G]footsteps in the hall
As I stumble through a world that used to [D7]be
Put one [G]out light one up pour [C]myself another [G]cup
Another cup of [D7]your memo[G]ry
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Neon lights are growin' dim from the [C]dawn that's creepin' [G]in
And it's time to struggle through another [D7]day
But I [G]know when I go home and I [C]find myself a[G]lone
That I'll go back into the [D7]time that got [G]away
