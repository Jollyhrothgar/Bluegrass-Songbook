{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]What's the use to deny we've been [F]living [C]a lie
That we should have admitted [G7]before
We were [C]just victims of [F]a half-hearted [C]love
So why should we [G7]try [C]anymore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The vows that we make are [F]only [C]to break
We drift like a wave from [G7]the shore
The [C]kisses we steal we [F]know are not [C]real
So why should we [G7]try [C]anymore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The dreams that we knew can [F]never [C]come true
They're gone to return [G7]no more
[C]False love like ours [F]fades with the [C]flowers 
So why should we [G7]try [C]anymore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Our story's so old [F]again has been [C]told
On the past let's close [G7]the door
And [C]smile don't regret but [F]live and [C]forget
There's no use to [G7]try [C]anymore
{end_of_verse}
