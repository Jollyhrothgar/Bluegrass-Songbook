{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]There's a blizzard coming on  how I'm [C]wishing I was [G]home
for my pony's lame  and he can hardly [D7]stand
Listen [G]to that norther sigh  if we [C]don't get home we'll [G]die
But it's [D7]only seven miles to Mary [Em]Ann's
It's [D7]only seven miles to Mary [G]Ann's
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You can bet we're on her mind  for it's nearly [G][C]supper-time
And I'll bet there's hot biscuits in the [D7]pan        
Lord my [G]hands feel like there froze  and there's a [C]numbness in my [G]toes
But it's [D7]only five more miles to Mary [Em]Ann's
It's [D7]only five more miles to Mary [G]Ann's
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
That wind's howling and it seems mighty like [C]a woman's [G]scream
And we'd best be moving faster if we [D7]can
Dan just [G]think about that barn with the hay [C]so soft and [G]warm
For it's [D7]only four more miles to Mary [Em]Ann's
It's [D7]only three more miles to Mary [G]Ann's
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Spoken:
[G]Dan get up you ornery cuss or [C]you'll be the death of [G]us
I'm so weary but I'll help you if I [D7]can
Alright [G]Dan perhaps it's best if we [C]stop a while and [G]rest
For it's [D7]still a hundred yards to Mary [Em]Ann's
It's [D7]still a hundred yards to Mary [Em]Ann's
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Spoken:
Late that night the storm was gone [C]they found him there at [G]dawn
He'd made it but he just couldn't leave old [D7]Dan
Yes they [G]found him there on the plains hands [C]froze to the [G]reigns
He was [D7]just a hundred yards form Mary [Em]Ann's
He was [D7]just a hundred yards from Mary [G]Ann's
{end_of_verse}
