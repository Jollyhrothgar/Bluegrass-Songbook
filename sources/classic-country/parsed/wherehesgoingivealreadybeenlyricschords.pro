{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Well I don't envy him at [C]all when I [D7]see him by your [G]side
Cause I know you're [F]making [C]plans to take him [D7]on your loveless [G]ride
On his trip through [D7]pleasure and he'll [G]love every [F]inch of the [C]way
Right up to the [G]end where he's going with [F]you I've [C]already been
But [G]I would never [D7]go back there [G]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]If I could [G]change the [C]pages in my [D7]book of life I [G]would
Rewrite the [F]story [C]different make it [D7]read the way it [G]should
But I can't [D7]erase the [G]mistake I [F]made I don't [C]have no magic [G]pen
Where he's going with [F]you I've [C]already been
But [G]I would never [D7]go back there [G]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
What a [D7]fool I was to fall in love with [C]you 
And try to change your [G]ways
You will [Em]love him for a while you will [A7]laugh and you will smile
But when [Am]you're through with him he'll pay the price I [D7]paid
And [G]I sure won't be [D7]here through the [G]hurt and the [F]tears
To [C]pick you up at your journeys [G]end
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Where he's going with [F]you I've [C]already been
And [G]I will never [D7]go back there [G]again
Where he's going with [F]you I've [C]already been
But [G]I will never [D7]go back there [C]again[G]
[D7]Never [G]again
