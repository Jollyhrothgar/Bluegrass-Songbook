[C]I don't know why you stayed with me so long

When you know all the reasons not to [C]stay[G7]

And [C]yet instead of leaving you go right on believing some[F]day I will
[C]Life will be better than it's [G7]been when my [F]ship comes [C]in [F]
[C]When my ship comes in we'll climb aboard together
And the hard times will be much softer [F]then
As we [G7]let the high tide take us to that distant shore 
Where paradise [C]begins[G7]
