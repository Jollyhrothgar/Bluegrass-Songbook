{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]If I’d never won your [Em]love [Am]
[G7]I wouldn’t be [C]missing you [F]   [G7]
But you [C]loved me just [Em]enough 
To make me [Am]think [G7]I had a [C]right to you
For a [F]while you gave [Am]me every[Dm]thing 
Showing [G7]me how good love [C]could be [F]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Yeah the [C]winner took it [F]all 
But [C]stumbled then the [F]fall
Even won the [G7]right to be [Am]free [E7]   [Am]
[C]Winning you sure made a [F]loser out of [G7]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
If I’d [C]never seen your [Em]face [Am]
I wouldn’t [G7]see you every time I [C]close my eyes[F]  [G7]
If I’d [C]never said I [Em]love you I’d [F]never [G7]had to say [C]goodbye
But I [F]did and here I [Am]am  all [Dm]alone like [G7]you said I’d [C]never be[F]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Yeah the [C]winner took it [F]all 
But [C]stumbled then the [F]fall
Even won the [G7]right to be [Am]free [E7]   [Am]
[C]Winning you sure made a [F]loser out of [G7]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
If [F]only I’d said no [Dm]instead of yes
I’d have [G7]never fallen in [C]love with you
But you [F]gave me the [Dm]best 
So anything less can [C]never make me feel the way you [G7]do
[C]Looking back at [Em]you [Am]
Is the [G7]only way my eyes can [C]see [F]  [G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Yeah the [C]winner took it [F]all 
But [C]stumbled then the [F]fall
Even won the [G7]right to be [Am]free[E7]   [Am]
[C]Winning you sure made a [F]loser out of [G7]me [C]
{end_of_verse}
