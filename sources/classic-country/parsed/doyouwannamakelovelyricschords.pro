[D7]Answer the question I must ask of [G]you

Do you want to make [C]love
Or do you just want to [G]fool around
I guarantee it will [D7]bring you down
If you [C]try and [D7]fool your[G]self
Do you want to make [C]love

You can take it [D7]seriously or take it somewhere [G]else

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Take all the freedom that a [C]lover will allow
If [D7]you feel the feeling that I'm [G]feeling now[D7]

[D7]Don't make a promise that you cannot [G]keep

You could do it so [G]easily
Is it love that I see when I [D7]look in your [C]eyes
Or just [D7]another empty [G]lie
