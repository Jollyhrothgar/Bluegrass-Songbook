{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Friend I'm writing you this [C]letter
And it's a long time [G]overdue
You're thinking just mind your own [D7]business
I wouldn't blame you if you [G]do
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You know our range is gettin' [C]smaller
Hear you're all busted up [G]inside
But it ain't the broncos that'll kill [D7]you
It's just that damned old cowboy [G]pride
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Cowboy pride can always get [C]a man [Am]through
But [D7]cowboy pride will make a fool of [G]you
Good women are hard to [D7]find
I'm talkin' about the faithful [G]kind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I hear you're running with that [C]waitress
And she's under age and [G]wild
You know your wife's the best there is [D7]son
Would you move in with that [G]child
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
She stuck with you through the hard [C]times
Think of all the nights she [G]cried
Will she be another [D7]victim
Of that same old cowboy [G]pride
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Guess it's time to close my [C]letter
It's just somethin' that I had to [G]do
You know I made the same mistake [D7]once
Before she fell in love with [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
So go home to your wife and [C]family
It's time to put the past [G]aside
So you don't end up like me [D7]now
Nothin' left but cowboy [G]pride
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Cowboy pride can always get [C]a man [Am]through
But [D7]cowboy pride will make a fool of [G]you
Good women are hard to [D7]find
I'm talkin' about the faithful [G]kind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
Don't end up like me [D7]now
With nothin' left but cowboy [G]pride
{end_of_verse}
