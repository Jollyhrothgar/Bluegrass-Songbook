{meta: title Teardrops Of Regret}
{meta: artist Jim Reeves}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I look [D7]back into the past since we [G]parted
The [C]last few days [D7]seemed like  a million [G]years
[C]Why was I so [D7]wrong and selfish [G]hearted
A smile can't find it's way [D7]through all these [G]tears
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The whole [D7]world seems to know I've been [G]unfaithful
It's [C]all my fault [D7]because we had to [G]part
It [C]hurts me so but [D7]do they know I'm [G]thankful
That I can pay with [D7]teardrops in my [G]heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I [D7]wish that I could sell these tears I'm [G]hiding 
Or [C]trade a broken [D7]heart in on my [G]debt
But [C]there's no sale for [D7]sorrow when you're [G]crying
So I'm paying with [D7]teardrops of [G]regret
{end_of_verse}
