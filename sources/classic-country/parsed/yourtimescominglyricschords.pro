{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Well I knew she belonged to someone else at the time
But lonely look in women are a [D7]weakness of mine
So I bought all she said about the love he never gave her
And figured I just love her some and do us both a favor
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Just [G]as I got up to leave he walked through the door
And I guess I thought [G7]he'd be sur[C]prised
But he [D7]looked at me as if to say he's been there before
And he offered me these words to the wise
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G]He said you know she's a cheater son 
But you believe that you're the one
Who's got a lot of what it takes to [D7]change her
And I’ve no doubt that you can't get her 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
You ain't much but that don't matter
Nothing suits her better than a [G]stranger
And the stranger man the better 
And the chances are she'll set her
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Eyes on you the next [G7]time she goes [C]slumming
So [D7]you sit back and wait your turn boy 
You got lots of times to learn boy
Cool it while you can your time's [G]coming
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Well it happens that in time it happened just like he said
And soon enough her shoes were setting [D7]under my bed
And I'll confess I did my best to prove that man had lied
But nothing short of suicide could keep her satisfied
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
So buddy [G]losing her to you was just a matter of time
And it's her time for finding [G7]something [C]new
No[D7]thing I can say is gonna make you change your mind
So I'll just give the same advice to you
{end_of_verse}
