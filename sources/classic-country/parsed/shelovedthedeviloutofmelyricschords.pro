{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]You can't see a freight train coming 
With your back against the track
You can only take the wrong road so long 
Before you can't come [G7]back
I was [C]heart broke and lonely 
Forgot what love was all [F]about
But then [C]just when I hit bottom 
[G7]She reached down and pulled me [C]out
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Led me [D]to the [F]promised [C]land
My rock of [G7]ages when I felt too weak to [C]stand
I was [D]blind and [F]could not [C]see she rescued [D7]me
Lord that [Dm]woman was my Savior 
[G7]She loved the devil out of [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I was once a believer 
Till life got the best of me
Just a ship without an anchor 
Adrift and lost at [G7]sea
Like the [C]wind she came and filled my sails 
And put me back on [F]course
She was the [C]lighthouse in the harbor 
[G7]That brought me back to [C]shore
