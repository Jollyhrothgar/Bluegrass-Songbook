{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I stumble through the [G7]door and I [C]order one more [Am]round
[D7]Someone laughs the bartender says [C]son you'd [D7]better sit [G]down
What they don't know is [G7]life don't matter [C]since you set me [Am]free
So [C]every time I [G]think of you I [D7]order one for [C]me [G]  [D7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [G]haven't got so [G7]low where every [C]girl looks good to [Am]me
But [D7]I can't seem to face the morning without a [C]drink [D7]or maybe [G]three
Just where you go when [G7]no one loves you is [C]more than I can [Am]see
So [C]every time I [G]think of you I [D7]order one for [C]me [G]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And that man in the [G7]mirror Lord he [C]looks so bad to [Am]me
Be[D7]hind the wine and the wasted time he's not [C]what I [D7]want to [G]be
But since you left me [G7]life don't matter and I [C]chase your memo[Am]ry
[C]A glass of wine could [G]ease my mind so I [D7]order one for [C]me [G]
Repeat last verse
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
So [C]every time I [G]think of you I [D7]order one for [C]me[G]
{end_of_verse}
