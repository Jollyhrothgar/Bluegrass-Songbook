{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Every time I hear the midnight trains 
[D7]Rolling out to the open [G7]plains
A sense of freedom fills my veins I get the [C]fever
Every time I sparrow flies up [D7]into the endless [G7]skies
Something down inside me cries I get the [C]fever
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]I get the fever to pack up and leave here 
[C]And wander wild like the wind
[F]This town's too full of memories of cruel love
And [C]I can't stand it seeing her with [G7]him
Every [C]time I hear a buddy say 
He's [D7]put lots of dust and [G7]clay
Between him and yesterday I get the [C]fever
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]I get the fever to pack and leave here 
And I think maybe I'll do just that [C]tomorrow
[F]This town's too full of memories of cruel love
[C]Everywhere I turn there's pain and [G7]sorrow
Every time I hear a [C]buddy say 
He's [D7]put lots of dust and [G7]clay
Between him and yesterday I get the [C]fever
[G7]I get the [C]fever [G7]I get the [C]fever I [G7]get the [C]fever
{end_of_verse}
