{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Tonight I feel a [C]chill in the [G]air 
As [C]cold as that [G]look on your [D7]face
I [G]hear what you're saying but [C]coming from [G]you 
[C]Goodbye seems so out of [D7]place
[F]How can you stand there and [C]honestly [G]say
There [C]never were [G]any real [A7]promises [D7]made

The [C]moon is my witness the [G]stars will agree
They [C]all heard you [G]promise you'd [A7]always love [D7]me
I [G]know that it's true but it's [C]hard to [A7]believe
You [Am]lied to the [G]moon the [D7]stars and [G]me

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And what about all of those [C]warm tender [G]nights
Did [C]they mean [G]nothing to [D7]you
And [G]where are the feelings I [C]thought that we [G]shared
Or [C]have you for[G]gotten them [D7]too
Did you [F]think I just put your [C]memory be[G]hind
When your [C]words are still [G]so very [A7]clear in my [D7]mind
