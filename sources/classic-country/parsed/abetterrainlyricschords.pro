{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Baby what do you say when love comes [F]down on you
Rainin' the [G7]blues on you
Like it's never gonna [F]end on you
And [C]all your dreams like leaves in the gutter go [F]floatin' by
No baby I [G7]don't know why all God's [F]children cry
I'll miss your [G7]skin as golden as your [F]wheat-field hair
And where you [G7]go I hope you [F]find out there
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
A better [C]rain
The kind that [Am]comes in off the [G7]coast and paints the [F]sky
And lets you know that [G7]God's alive
A better [Em]rain [F]
That'll [C]wash me from your [Am]eyes so [G7]you can smile [F]again
And be all [G7]right again in a better [C]rain
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Someday is gonna find you in a [F]sweeter place
Long after [G7]time has erased
All the words like [F]razor blades
[C]You'll remember you and me [F]before the flood
Once upon a [G7]time in love a [F]beautiful us
[G7]I can see you on some [F]stretch of sand
[G7]Spinin' round in circles barefoot [F]dancin' in

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
A better [Em]rain [F]
That'll [C]leave behind a [Am]rainbow [G7]in the [F]sky
Lets you know that [G7]God's alive
In a better [F]rain  [G7]a better [F]rain[C]   [G7]
[C]A better [F]rain
