[C]I said when you left me the [F]hurt will go [C]away
I don't really need you never loved you [G7]anyway

But it's funny and yet it's sad [F]what a man will [C]do
To drive away precious memories of a woman like [G7]you

But here I am [G7]back on my knees [C]again

But here I am [G7]down on my knees [C]again
