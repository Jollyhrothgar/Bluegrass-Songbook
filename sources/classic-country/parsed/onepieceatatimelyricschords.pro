{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Well I left Kentucky back in '49
And went to Detroit working on assembly [F]line
The [G7]first year they had me putting wheels on [C]Cadillac's
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Every day I'd watch them beauties roll by
And sometimes I'd hang my head [F]and cry
'Cause I [G7]always wanted me one that was long and [C]black
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
One day I devised myself a plan
That should be the envy of most any [F]man
I'd [G7]sneak it outta there in a lunch box in my [C]hand
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Now getting caught meant getting fired
But I figured I'd have it all by the time I [F]retired
I'd [G7]have me a car worth at least a hundred [C]grand
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I'd get it one piece at a time and it wouldn't cost me a [F]dime
You'll [G7]know it's me when I come through your [C]town
I'm gonna ride around in style I'm gonna drive everybody [F]wild
'Cause [G7]I'll have the only one there is [C]around
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
So the very next day when I punched in
With my big lunch box and with help from my [F]friends
I [G7]left that day with a lunch-box full of [C]gears
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
I've never considered myself a thief
But GM wouldn't miss just one little [F]piece
[G7]Especially if I strung it out over several [C]years
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
The first day I got me a fuel pump
And the next day I got me an engine and a [F]trunk
Then [G7]I got me a transmission and all the [C]chrome
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 9}
The little things I could get in my big lunch box
Like nuts and bolts and all four [F]shocks
[G7]But the big stuff we snuck out in my buddy's mobile [C]home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 10}
Now up to now my plan went alright
Till we tried to put it all together one [F]night 
And [G7]that's when we noticed that something was definitely [C]wrong
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 11}
The transmission was a '53
And the motor turned out to be [F]a '73
And [G7]when we tried to put in the bolts all the holes were [C]gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 12}
So we drilled it out so that it would fit
And with a little bit of help from an adapter [F]kit
We [G7]had that engine running just like a [C]song
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 13}
Now the headlights they was another sight
We had two on the left and one on the [F]right
But [G7]when we pulled out the switch all three of 'em come [C]on
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 14}
The back end looked kind of funny too
But we put it together and when we got [F]through
Well [G7]that's when we noticed that we only had one tail [C]fin
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 15}
About that time my wife walked out
And I could see in her eyes that she had her [F]doubts
But she [G7]opened the door and said honey take me for a [C]spin
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 16}
So we drove uptown just to get the tags
And I headed her right on down main [F]drag
I could [G7]hear everybody laughing for blocks [C]around
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 17}
But up there at the courthouse they didn't laugh
Cause to type it up it took the whole [F]staff
And when [G7]they got through the title weighed sixty [C]pounds
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 18}
I got it one piece at a time and it wouldn't cost me a [F]dime
You'd [G7]know it's me when I come through your [C]town
I'm gonna ride around in style I'm gonna drive everybody [F]wild
'Cause I'll [G7]have the only one there is [C]around
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 19}
spoken:
Ah yeah Red Rider this is the Cottonmouth
In the Psychobilly Cadillac come on
Ah this is the Cottonmouth and negatory
On the cost of this machine there Red Rider
You might say I went right up to the factory and picked it up
It's cheaper that way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 20}
Ah what model is it
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 21}
[C]Well it's a '49, '50, '51, '52, '53, '54, '55, [F]'56
[G7]'57 '58' 59' [C]Automobile
It's a '60, '61, '62, '63, '64, '65, '66, [F]'67
[G7]'68, '69, '70 [C]Automobile
{end_of_verse}
