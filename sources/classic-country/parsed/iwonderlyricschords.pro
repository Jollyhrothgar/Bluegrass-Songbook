{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Every time I'm near you  [G7]my heart jumps all [C]about
[A7]My mind can't figure [D7]out  what to [G]do
[G7]But I've been disillusioned  enough by love turned [C]blue
[A7]Your love could be [D7]true  but I [G]wonder
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[D7]Am I  supposed to think  your love will be [G]true
[A7]And deny the part of me that [Am]says you'll leave me [D7]too
[G]Cause yesterday reminds me  that [G7]what I've lost is [C]gone
[A7]Your love may linger on  [D7]but I [G]wonder
{end_of_verse}

[G7]I heard all your stories they ring well in my [C]ears
[A7]But raise certain [D7]fears  and [G]doubts
[G7]Cause yesterday reminds me  that what I've lost is [C]gone
[A7]Your love may linger on  [D7]but I [G]wonder
[D7]I wonder   yeah I [G]wonder
