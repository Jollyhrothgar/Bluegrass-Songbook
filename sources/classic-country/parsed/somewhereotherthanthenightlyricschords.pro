{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[Am]He could see the storm clouds [F]rollin' across the [C]hill
[Em]He barely beat the [Am]rain in from the [F]field
And [C]between the backdoor slammin' she heard him [F]say [C]
[Dm]Damn this rain and damn this wasted [G7]day

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But she'd been [C]waitin' for this rain for oh so [F]long
She was [C]standin' in the kitchen with nothin' but her apron [G7]on
And in [Am]disbelief he [G7]stood and he stared a [F]while
When their [C]eyes met they both began to [G7]smile
{end_of_verse}

Somewhere other than the [F]night she [G7]needs to hear I [C]love you
Somewhere other than the [F]night she [G7]needs to know you [C]care[G7]
She [Am]wants to know she's needed she [A7]needs to be held [F]tight
[Dm]Somewhere [G7]other than the [C]night

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
They spent the [Am]day wrapped up in a [F]blanket 
On the front porch [C]swing
He'd come to [Em]realize he'd [Am]neglected certain [F]things
And there are [C]times she feels alone even by his [F]side
Like it was the [Dm]first time she ever saw him [G7]cry
