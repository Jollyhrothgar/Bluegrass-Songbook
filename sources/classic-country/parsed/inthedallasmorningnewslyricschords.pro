{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I heard a nasty rumor you were seeing someone new
Until you see it for yourself you [G7]hate to think it’s true
But I no longer have to wonder or be so confused
Cause the truth is looking at me in the Dallas Morning [C]News
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Yes it’s right there in the Dallas Morning News
I opened up the paper and [G7]there he was with you
It’s so hard to let go of something you don’t wanna lose
But it’s right there in the Dallas Morning [C]News
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I saved the picture then threw away the paper and my pride
I sat it on the dresser and just [G7]stared at it and cried
And now the thought of Elma and order lots of booze 
To help me face what’s printed in the Dallas Morning [C]News
