[G]You've walked out so many times
And [C]left me with a worried mind
[D7]Confused alone not knowing what to [G]do [C]  [D7]
Then [G]you come back and I'd forgive
And [C]heartaches end but memories live
Each [D7]time I turn a lighter shade of [G]blue[C]  [G]

Cause I [C]don't hurt the way I used to hurt

Could it [A7]be a sign I'm gettin' over [D7]you
[G]There'll come a day it won't be long
[C]You'll come back and find me gone
[D7]Each time I turn a lighter shade of [G]blue[C]  [G]
