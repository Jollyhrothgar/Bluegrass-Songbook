[C]I plowed the fields and [G7]I planted the [C]seed
I worked my [G7]hands to the [C]bone
But the ground laid [C7]barren till [F]He sent the [C]sunshine
For I can do [G7]nothing a[C]lone

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I raised the corn and [G7]I rode to the [C]mill
With the best crop [G7]I ever had [C]grown
But the wheel wouldn't grind till [F]He stirred the [C]waters
For I can do [G7]nothing a[C]lone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G7]I can do nothing a[C]lone
I'm [G7]weak and my Master is [C]strong
I held the [C7]pencil but [F]He wrote this [C]song
For I can do [G7]nothing a[C]lone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
And now as my years lead [G7]me into the [C]valley
I've asked Him to [G7]please come [C]home
For I walk in [C7]search of the [F]good life here[C]after
And I can do [G7]nothing a[C]lone
{end_of_verse}

For I can do [G7]nothing a[C]lone
