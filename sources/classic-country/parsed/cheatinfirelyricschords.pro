{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Cheatin' fire [F]it's gonna burn [C]higher
Do we lay here in the ashes unconcerned
Every [Am]night it's still the [C]same
Pour [F]fuel on the [C]flame
Before this [Am]cheatin' fire goes [G7]out someone will get [C]burned
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Here we are again too far [F]gone to gain con[C]trol
And we can't find a way to kill the [G7]flame
We get [F]lost in our [C]love
Don't [F]know which way to [C]turn
So we just build a [G7]fire and let it [C]burn

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well it doesn't feel so wrong
Cause the [F]fire's gone out at [C]home
And right now this feeling's more than we can [G7]stand
We [F]find we're just too [C]weak to [F]fight this strong [C]desire
And tonight we'll build [G7]another cheatin' [C]fire
