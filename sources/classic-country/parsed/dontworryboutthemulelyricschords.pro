{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Well you said you wouldn't leave me 
Cause you didn't want to grieve me
And you couldn't stand to see tears in my [G7]eyes
But you said you loved another 
And it ain't like he's your brother
So I guess it's time for me to rea[C]lize
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Don't worry 'bout the mule just load the [G7]wagon
I can make it baby and I ain't [C]bragging
If you think I'm going to cry your feet are [F]draggin'
Don't [G7]worry 'bout the mule just load the [C]wagon
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well I think that I'll surrender 
You keep looking out the windows
And it's plain that you don't love me any [G7]way
All you do is walk and piddle 
While I'm playing second fiddle
I don't think that I can stand another [C]day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Don't worry 'bout the mule just load the [G7]wagon
I can make it baby and I ain't [C]bragging
If you think I'm going to cry your feet are [F]draggin'
Don't [G7]worry 'bout the mule just load the [C]wagon
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
For a long time I've been knowin' 
In your eyes it's all been showin'
And I knew some day someone would take my [G7]place
These cold kisses you've been givin' 
And the way that we've been livin'
It's enough to turn old Carl plumb [C]gray
{end_of_verse}
