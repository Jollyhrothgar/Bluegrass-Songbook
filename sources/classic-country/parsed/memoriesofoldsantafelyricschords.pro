{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]As blue shadows [G7]fall a[C]cross the canyon [C7]wall
The [F]cattle are quiet and [C]still [G7]
[C]Dusty sore and [G7]tired I [C]build myself a fire
As a [D7]full moon peaks over the [G7]hills
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
A [C]blanket for my [G7]bed a [C]saddle for my [C7]head
I'll [F]sleep but in my dreams I'll [E7]stray
[A7]Back across the miles to [D7]where my darlin' smiles
In [G7]memories of old Santa [C]Fe
{end_of_verse}

Adi[F]os mi Cori[Fm]nyo she [C]told me that day
As [D7]I kissed her softly and [Dm]then rode a[G7]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Now I [C]lie beneath the [G7]stars with[C]out her in my [C7]arms
So [F]lonesome and so far a[E7]way
But each [A7]night I go back there in my [D7]dreams and in my prayers
And in [G7]memories of old Santa [C]Fe
{end_of_verse}

She's [A7]waitin' there I know but for [D7]now all I can hold
Are my [G7]memories of old Santa [C]Fe
