[G]Friend don't worry about this heavy load I [C]carry
Don't be con[G]cerned if it sends me to my [D7]knees

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
If these [C]feeble hands of faith could only [G]reach out
Through this dark and dreary storm of un[D7]belief

I'll be al[G]right as soon as [D7]I touch Calva[G]ry
{end_of_verse}

Very soon now I'll reach the hill of [C]Golgotha
I'll touch that [G]cross so cruelly fashioned from a [D7]tree
And if [G]just one precious drop of His blood [C]touches me
I'll be al[G]right because [D7]I've touched Calva[G]ry
{end_of_verse}

I'll be al[G]right as soon as [D7]I touch Calva[G]ry
