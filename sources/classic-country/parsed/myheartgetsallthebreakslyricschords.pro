[C]Just my heart's luck to be stuck with a [G7]fool like me
The only thing I bring my heart is [C]misery
I can't hold on to you no matter [F]how I try
The [G7]only time your lips meet mine is when I'm gettin' kissed [C]goodbye
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Someone always gets to hold you in their [G7]arms it seems
While I'm left to hold the bag of [C]broken dreams
Will my eyes get all the tears and my [F]head gets all the aches
And my [G7]heart poor old heart gets all the [C]breaks
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
My heart keeps begging me to stay [G7]away from you
It knows darn well you're only out to [C]make me blue
Every time I think I'm gonna [F]hold you near
Some[G7]one walks by gives you the eye and like a ghost you disa[C]ppear
