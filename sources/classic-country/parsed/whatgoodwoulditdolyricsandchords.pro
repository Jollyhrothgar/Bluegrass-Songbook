{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Sometimes in the night my world gets [G7]lonely
But when [Dm]I reach for [G7]you you're never [C]there[G7]
Your [C]sweet memories dance through my mind
To the [F]beat of this lonely heart of mine
And [Dm]I know that I should [G7]go somewhere
[Dm]Try to find [G7]someone who cares for [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But what [C7]good would it [F]do [G7]
Oh where would I [C]find her
For this heart of [F]mine there's no way to find
Someone like [G7]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I could [C]search constant[F]ly [G7]
Till the end of for[C]ever
But if [F]you won't come [C]home
I'd still be [G7]alone
So what good would it [C]do
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
But if [F]you won't come [C]home
I'd still be [G7]alone
So what good would it [F]do[C]
