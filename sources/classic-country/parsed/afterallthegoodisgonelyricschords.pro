{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Today I got a letter from [D7]someone
Just a friend we knew some time [G]ago
And as I read between the lines I began to [C]realize
[A7]He didn't know I lost you a long long time [D7]ago
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G]Oh I just can't make it any [D7]longer
Everything I do is always [G]wrong
I'm living a lie and there's no need in [C]trying
To keep [G]hanging on [D7]after all the good is [G]gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Lord I wish that I could die and there's no use in [C]trying
To keep [G]hanging on [D7]after all the good is [G]gone
{end_of_verse}
