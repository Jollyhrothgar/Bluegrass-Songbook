{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]At mail call today dear your last letter [D7]came
I just stood there smiling till they called my [G]name
As I read it over the skies [G7]turned to grey  [C]
And [D7]tears dimmed my eyes love at mail call [G]today
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I can't understand love what happened to [D7]you
The day that I sailed love you said you'd be [G]true
But now it's over what [G7]more can I [C]say
My [D7]poor heart was broken at mail call [G]today
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I slept in the foxhole amid shot and [D7]shell
I'm telling you darling it's worse than all [G]hell
I thought you would wait love [G7]while I was [C]away
But [D7]my castles tumbled at mail call [G]today
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I hope you'll be happy with somebody [D7]new
But always remember my heart beats for [G]you
Good luck and God bless you [G7]wherever you [C]stray
The [D7]world for me ended at mail call [G]today
{end_of_verse}
