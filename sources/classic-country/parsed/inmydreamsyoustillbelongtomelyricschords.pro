{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Now at last you've gone and left [G7]me 
Like a piece of driftwood on the [C]sea
You said that you no longer loved [G7]me 
But in my dreams you still belong to [C]me 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
In my [F]dreams you're still my only [C]darling
Just like you used to [G7]be
And [C]though I've lost you to [F]another 
In my [C]dreams you [G7]still belong to [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
At night when I am sad and [G7]lonely 
It's then I really know you're [C]gone
But I just go to sleep [G7]praying 
That you'll be back before so [C]long
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
No matter where you wander [G7]darling
If it be across the deep blue [C]sea
Everyday you'll know I'll miss [G7]you 
And in my dreams you'll still belong to [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
In my [F]dreams you're still my only [C]darling
Just like you used to [G7]be
And [C]though I've lost you to [F]another 
In my [C]dreams you [G7]still belong to [C]me
{end_of_verse}
