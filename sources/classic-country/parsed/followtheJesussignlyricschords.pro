{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I don't care about your doctrine
I don't [F]care how you believe
As [G7]long as you love Jesus you and [C]I can agree
One day the whole world will discover
How to [F]love one another
And what [G7]Jesus meant when He said follow [C]Me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You take your way and I'll take mine
Just [F]follow the Jesus sign
[G7]He leads a trail of love anywhere His [C]feet may roam
Praise the Lord the day will come
When we'll [F]all meet as one
And [G7]follow the Jesus sign that leads us [C]home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I don't care about your color
I'm not [F]concerned with your creed
Cause [G7]deep inside we're all alike
With the [C]same old human needs
Jesus Christ gave us the answer
Our [F]fathers will be done
And [G7]when you read the good book
Read the words of God's own [C]Son
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}

When we'll [F]all meet as one
And [G7]follow the Jesus sign that leads us [C]home
