[G]You put me on a cloud with your first kiss
Lovin' me was your only wish
I was [D7]feelin' like a king on a [G]throne

The cloud is burstin' it's pourin' rain
On the [D7]emptiness I feel in my [G]soul

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I could sail to China on the [D7]tears I've cried

In a broken [D7]heart on a [C]sea of blue

The sky above has turned so dark
And we've drifted so far apart
We can't [D7]even find the time to say good[G]bye

Now wave so long to what might have been
Say hello to the wind
And [D7]slowly disappear with the [G]tide

I could sail to China on the [D7]tears I've cried
