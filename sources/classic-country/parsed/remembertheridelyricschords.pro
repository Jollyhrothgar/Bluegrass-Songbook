{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]He spent his days with horses and his [Dm]nights with Rosa Lee
He [F]spent his pay on whiskey that was [G7]made in Tennessee
As [C]I was growing up he spent a [Dm]lot of time with me
Once I [F]asked him about women and he just [G7]grinned
He said [F]son I know [G7]horses like the [F]back [G7]of my [C]hand
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G7]He said [Am]some were born to run
Some will [Em]stomp you just for fun
And [F]some have got the [G7]devil in their [C]eyes
[G7]There’s [Am]some that you can trust
And some that will [Em]leave you in the dust
And the [F]wild ones who shake you up [G7]inside
But you'll [F]always [G7]remember the [C]ride
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Like him I've rode some horses
Some are [Dm]fast and some are slow
I've [F]known my share of women
I've seen ‘em [G7]come and I've seen ‘em go
The [C]horses I can handle but the [Dm]women’s got me thrown
Now I [F]smile when I remember that old [G7]man
Because [F]he knew more than [G7]horses like the [F]back [G7]of his [C]hand
