{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Oh jealous me and careless you the odds were just too [G7]great
I couldn't take those lonely nights you made me sit and [C]wait
I thought I'd seen the last of you when you walked out of [G7]sight
Instead I see you in my dreams each [C]night
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
So the key's in the mailbox come on [F]in
I'm [G7]sitting here wishing dear I had your love [C]again
I'll never even ask you where you've [F]been 
The [G7]key's in the mailbox come on [C]in
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I said I'd rather be alone than share your [G7]company
I said don't come around at all if you want more than [C]me
But sitting here alone I can't deny the flame that [G7]burns
I'd gladly take you back on any [C]terms
{end_of_verse}
