[G]There's just no way of goin' back to [C]change what's come and gone

If [C]heartache were treasures and [G]pain could be sold
If dreams were [C]made of [G]silver and [A7]promises of [D7]gold

And be the [D7]richest fool [G]alive

Next time I listen to my friends take [C]their advice to heart
And avoid all of this [G]misery I could've ended from the [D7]start

They see just what they [G]wanna see and [D7]miss it when it's [G]gone
