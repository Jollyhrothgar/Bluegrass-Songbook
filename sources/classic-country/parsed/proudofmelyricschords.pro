[C]As the sun's coming [G7]up   she [F]puts coffee [C]on
Love in a [G7]cup  she [F]makes it [C]strong
She kisses my [A#7]cheek and I'm on my [F]way
With [G]her on my mind I work hard all [C]day
Just trying to [G7]keep   [F]her proud of [C]me

It's hard to be[G7]lieve   a [F]girl like her [C]fell
For someone with [G7]grease   under [F]his finger[C]nails
And like a [A#7]tattoo soap can't wash [F]off
It's easy to [G]see I'm nobody's [C]boss
I'm just trying to [G7]keep   [F]her proud of [C]me[Am]    [Dm]

Oh even [F]though I can't give her [G]much
But I think that she [C]knows 
I'm just trying to [G7]keep   [F]her proud of [C]me
