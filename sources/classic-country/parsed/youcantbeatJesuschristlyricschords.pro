{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Well I used to crank and drank until my back was to the floor
I'd take it to the limit then I'd try to get some more
Yeah when it [F]came to gamblin' well Lord I'd know how to roll them [C]dice
Ain't no [G7]two ways about it I [F]have been saved by Jesus [C]Christ
Yes I have praise the Lord guitar

Even though I am a sinner He will always be my friend
Well He starts in the middle and He does not have an end

Ain't no [G7]reason to deny it I [F]owe it all to Jesus [C]Christ
