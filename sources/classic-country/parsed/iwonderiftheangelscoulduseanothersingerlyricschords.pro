{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I hear the sweetest singin' 
[F]Coming from the land across the [C]distant shore
The sweetest harmony a [F]melody I've never heard [C]before
The [F]music's like the sound of many [C]waters
Like a [G7]million voices piercing through the [C]sky
It must be the angels [F]rehearsing for the banquet
[C]Makin' preparations for the [G7]wedding in the [C]sky
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And I wonder if the angels could [F]use another singer
I'd [C]like to join the chorus
When they [D7]gather round the [G7]throne
When my [C]body's new and my [A#7]voice 
Is strong [F]maybe I could sing along
[G7]Wonder if the [C]angels could [F]use another [C]singer
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I hear the silver trumpets 
The [F]violins play a different [C]symphony
They're contemplating [F]celebrating the crownin' of the [C]King
Well [F]maybe I can join them in the [C]mornin' 
[G7]Just before the breakin' of the [C]dawn
I have an invitation to [F]join the celebration
Swing [C]wide those pearly gates there's a [G7]singer comin' [C]home
