She is such a fragile thing Lord [G7]I hate to make her [C]cry

[C]She cussed me like a sailor kicked a [G]hole through the kitchen wall
She [A7]threw a fit and threw the phone [D7]halfway down the hall
She [G]said I'll be down at the bar then I [C]heard the front door [A7]slam
I guess [C]all in all she [D7]took it like a [G]man

I didn't think that she could [G]take it [D7]but she took it like a [G]man
