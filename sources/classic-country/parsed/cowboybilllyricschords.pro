{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]He told a good story and all of us [F]kids [C]listened
Bout his life on the border and the way it was [G7]then
And [C]we all believed and when [F]he would [C]finish
We'd ask the old cowboy to [G7]tell 'em [C]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You could [Am]almost hear those [C]prairie winds blowin'
His [Am]saddle a creaking neath his [C]old faded jea[G7]ns
You could [C]taste the dry dust from the trail [F]he was [C]ridin'
As he sat there and he painted those [G7]west Texas [C]scenes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And the [F]grown-ups would tell us you [C]boys keep your distance
That [D7]old man's just tellin' you [G7]lies
But to [C]all of us kids Cowboy [F]Bill was a [C]hero
Just as true as his [G7]blue Texas [C]sky
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
He told of a time when he rode [F]with the [C]Rangers
Down on the Pecos and he saved the [G7]day
Out[C]numbered by plenty they were almost [F]to [C]cover
With thirty banditos [G7]headed their [C]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
He looked [Am]back just in time to [C]see a horse stumble
The [Am]captain went down and Bill pulled [C]up on his [G7]reins
Through a [C]flurry of bullets he rescued [F]the [C]captain
They rode for a sunset just the [G7]story r[C]emains
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And the [F]grown-ups would tell us you [C]boys keep your distance
That [D7]old man's just tellin' you [G7]lies
But to [C]all of us kids Cowboy [F]Bill was a [C]hero
Just as true as his [G7]blue Texas [C]sky
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
But I still remember the day [F]that it [C]happened
We waited and we waited but Bill never [G7]showed
The [C]folks at the feed store said they [F]hadn't [C]seen him
So we set out for his place down [G7]Old Grist Mill [C]Road
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
And we [Am]cried when we found him lying [C]there with his memories
The [Am]old trunk wide open things [C]scattered [G7]about
He was [C]clutchin' a badge that said [F]Texas [C]Ranger
And an old yeller letter said [G7]Texas is [C]proud
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
And those [F]grown-ups had told us you [C]boys keep your distance
That [D7]old man's just tellin' you [G7]lies
[C]Now they're all sayin' that Cowboy Bill [F]was a [C]hero
Just as true as his [G7]blue Texas [F]skies
Just as [C]true as his [G7]blue Texas [C]skies
{end_of_verse}
