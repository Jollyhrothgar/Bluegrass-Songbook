{meta: artist Hank Snow}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]The lights were burning low and Mister Midnight [C]made his [G]way
[D7]Old Father Time had trudged along to close another [G]day
[C]The old clock ticked and seemed to say your heart is sad [G]and blue
[A7]But just remember [D7]pal there's others broken [G]too
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]I told the moon it was so hard to play love's losing hand
[G]When you thought you drew a sweetheart she [A7]was just a fickle [D7]friend
[G]Don't mind my tears remember there's still a million [C]hearts in [G]bloom
[A7]So keep on shining though [D7]I'm pining silvery [G]moon
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]The trade winds brought a message in from far across [G]the sea
[D7]They said they saw the silver sails that carried you from [G]me
[C]They told me you were drifting on upon an endless [G]tide
[A7]And lonely seagulls hovered [D7]o'er you as you [G]cried
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]If I could send a message on the crest of every wave
[G]They'd take you my forgiveness [A7]and two broken hearts we'd [D7]save
[G]But instead I'll ask each little star to guide your [C]ship back [G]home
[A7]So keep on shining though [D7]I'm pining silvery [G]moon
{end_of_verse}
