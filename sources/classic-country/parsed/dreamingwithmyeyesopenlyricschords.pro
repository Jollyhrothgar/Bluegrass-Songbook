{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I spent half my life on bended knee beggin' somebody to change
And the [A#7]other half prayin' to [F]God that they never [C]would
And all it got me was twice as lost when it all turned out the same
But [A#7]all that beggin' finally [F]did somebody [C]good
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I used to dream all [G7]night of a day that was [F]gone
But come the morning [G7]light forever from now [F]on
Gonna do my [G7]dreaming with my eyes wide [F]ope[C]n
I'll do my [A#7]looking back [F]with my eyes [C]closed
We can do some [G7]livin' or spend our whole life [F]hop[C]in'
In the end we're [A#7]left with [F]the one we [G7]chose
So I'll do my [F]dreaming  with my eyes wide [C]open
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Every time the world moved on I fell a little further behind
From [A#7]running back or [F]following someone [C]home
Until I learned that one step forward will take you further on
Than a [A#7]thousand back or a [F]million that ain't your [C]own
