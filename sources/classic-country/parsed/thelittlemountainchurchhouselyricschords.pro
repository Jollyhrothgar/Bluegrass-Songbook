{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]There's a little mountain church in my [F]thoughts of yesterday
Where [C]friends and family gathered for the [G7]Lord
There an [C]ol' fashioned preacher taught the [F]straight and narrow way
For what few [C]coins the con[G7]gregation could [C]afford

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Dressed in all our Sunday best we sat on [F]pews of solid oak
And [C]I remember how our voices filled the [G7]air
How momma [C]sounded like an angel on those [F]high soprano notes
When the [C]roll is called up [G7]yonder I'll be [C]there
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Looking back now that little mountain [F]church house
Has [C]become my life's corner[G7]stone
It was [C]there in that little mountain [F]church house
I first [C]heard the words [G7]I based my life [C]upon
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
At the all day Sunday singings and [F]dinner on the ground
[C]Many were the souls that were [G7]revived
While the [C]bothers and the sisters who've gone [F]on to Gloryland
Slept in [C]peace in the [G7]maple grove [C]nearby
{end_of_verse}
