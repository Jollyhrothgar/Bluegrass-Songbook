The [C]cattle string [G7]out along the [C]fences

As the storm clouds gather on [G7]high

The [C]wheels of the [G7]wagons stop [C]turning

On the husks in the barn through the [G7]day

The [C]drover draws [G7]rein by the [C]river 
Its [F]years since he's seen it so [C]high

When the rain tumbles [G7]down in [C]July
