{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I got a day without [E7]nothing to do 
And a [F]do not disturb on my [C]door
[F]I sorta looked for some [C]mess that she'd [Am]made 
Or her [D7]sweet little socks on the [G7]floor
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But [C]all that she left here was [E7]too many rooms 
And [F]just enough silence to [C]break
[G7]And I can't look at her picture right now 
Time's about all I can [C]take[G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]Last night I sewed up her [E7]toys that were torn 
[F]And packed her suitcase [C]again
[F]She looked so sweet as she [C]lay there [Am]asleep 
[D7]Smiling and holding my [G7]hand
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]We didn't talk all the [E7]way to the plane 
[F]But she's too big now to [C]cry
[G7]Then when I kissed her she held me so tight 
I couldn't tell her good[C]bye
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
She said [F]I wish that we lived [C]together again 
[G7]It gets so lonesome [C]apart
[F]I'm missing somebody [C]all of the time 
[G7]Daddy it's breaking my [C]heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
It's not so bad out here [E7]living alone 
[F]Comfort's a stranger [C]away
[F]And there's a freedom you [C]find on your [Am]own 
That's [D7]nearly worth what you [G7]pay
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
[C]It's just a shame she still [E7]wants us to be 
[F]All that we seemed to [C]before
[G7]But we can't blame her for making believe 
Something we don't any[C]more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
She said [F]I wish that we lived [C]together again 
[G7]It gets so lonesome [C]apart
[F]I'm missing somebody [C]all of the time 
[G7]Daddy it's breaking my [C]heart
{end_of_verse}
