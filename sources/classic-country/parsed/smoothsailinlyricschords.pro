Looks like every drop of rain is [Am]gone gone gone
Smooth [D7]sailin' sailin'
And a blue sky full of rainbows from now [G]on

Now we're not afraid when storm clouds [D7]gather
Cause we got the kind of love to see us [G]through

We found that that's safest place to [Am]go
From now on we can laugh at troubled [D7]waters
Cause our roughest storms just seem to make love [G]grow
