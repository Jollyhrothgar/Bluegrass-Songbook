{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Slowly but [F]surely I've [C]watched your love die
Now you run my heart over with [G7]care
I [C]know oh so [F]well that you [C]don't want me now
Tell me darlin' where do [G7]I go from [C]here
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I built all my [F]plans and my [C]hopes around you
No other can replace you [G7]dear
I've [C]seen all my [F]dreams and my [C]hopes fade away
So tell me darlin' where do [G7]I go from [C]here
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
You [F]know that your pride is [C]makin' you stay
But [F]sympathy ain't what I wanna [G7]hear

So tell me darlin' where do [G7]I go from [C]here
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I know that your [F]heart is [C]far away
And there's nothin' for me but my [G7]tears

So my darlin' [G7]I'm goin' from [C]here
{end_of_verse}
