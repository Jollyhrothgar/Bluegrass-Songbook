{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Gypsy feet will wander gypsy feet will [G7]stray
Neither love nor thunder can ever make them [C]stay
I can't tame a heart so wild like a jungle drum it [G7]beats
Were you born a devil's child with restless gypsy [C]feet
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]Gypsy feet keep [C]dancing to the tune of [G7]vio-[C]lins
[F]Just like [G7]devil's [C]prancing you [Dm]dance away your [G7]sins
If [C]I could tame your restless heart would [F]make my life complete
But I can't put an [C]anchor [G7]on those gypsy [C]feet
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
My picture's in your locket on that golden [G7]chain
Money's in your pocket and you're gone [C]again
Gypsy lips will promise vows they never [G7]keep
Hearts like mine are crumbled beneath your gypsy [C]feet

[F]Gypsy feet keep [C]dancing to the tune of [G7]vio-[C]lins
[F]Just like [G7]devil's [C]prancing you [Dm]dance away your [G7]sins
If [C]I could tame your restless heart would [F]make my life complete
But I can't put an [C]anchor [G7]on those gypsy [C]feet
