{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]It’s been ten years and [F]three since I [C]first went to sea
And I [F]sailed from old [C]Ireland and [G7]home
And those [C]hills lush and [F]green were a [C]part of my dreams
When I [F]dreamed of my [G7]Colleen Ma[C]lone 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
On the day I [F]returned to my [C]sorrow I learned
That the [F]angels had [C]called her [G7]away
To a [C]grave on a [F]hill over[C]looking the mill
That’s the [F]place where [G7]she’s sleeping [C]today
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
As the [G7]soft breezes blow through the [F]meadow I [C]go
Past the [F]mill with the [C]moss covered [G7]stone
Up the pathway I climb through the [F]woods and the [C]pines
To [F]be with my [G7]Colleen Ma[C]lone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
She was faithful each [F]day as I [C]sailed far away
There was [F]no one but [C]me that she [G7]loved
I [C]remember those [F]eyes soft and [C]blue as the skies
And her [F]heart was as [G7]pure as a [C]dove
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
For the rest of my [F]life I will [C]not take a wife
I will [F]live in this [C]valley [G7]alone       
Planting [C]flowers [F]around in this [C]soft gentle ground
That is [F]holding my [G7]Colleen Ma[C]lone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
As the [G7]soft breezes blow through the [F]meadow I [C]go
Past the [F]mill with the [C]moss covered [G7]stone
Up the pathway I climb through the [F]woods and the [C]pines
To [F]be with my [G7]Colleen Ma[C]lone
{end_of_verse}
