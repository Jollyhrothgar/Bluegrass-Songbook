{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]And now the end is [Em]near
And so I [Gm]face the final [A7]curtain 
My [Dm]friend I’ll say it clear
I’ll state my [G7]case of which I’m [C]certain
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I’ve lived a life that’s full
I’ve traveled [F]each and every [Fm]highway
And [C]more much more than [G7]this
I did it [F]my  [C]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Regrets I’ve had a [Em]few
But then a[Gm]gain too few to [A7]mention
I [Dm]did what I had to do
And saw it [G7]through without exem[C]ption
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I planned each charted course
Each careful [F]step along the [Fm]byway
And [C]more much more [G7]than this
I did it [F]my  [C]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Yes there were times I’m sure you knew
When I bit [F]off more than I could chew
But through it [Dm]all when there was [G7]doubt
I ate it [Em]up and spit it [Am]out
I faced it [Dm]all and I stood [G7]tall
And did it my [C]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
I’ve loved  I’ve laughed and [Em]cried
I’ve had my [Gm]fill  my share of [A7]losing
And [Dm]now  as tears subside
I find it [G7]all so a[C]musing
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
To think I did all that
And may I [F]say  not in a [Fm]shy way
[C]No oh no not [G7]me
I did it [F]my  [C]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
For what is a man what has he got
If not him[F]self then he has naught
To say the [Dm]words he truly [G7]feels
And not the [Em]words of one who [Am]kneels
The record [Dm]shows I took the [G7]blows
And did it my [C]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 9}
The record [Dm]shows I took the [G7]blows
And did it my [C]way
{end_of_verse}
