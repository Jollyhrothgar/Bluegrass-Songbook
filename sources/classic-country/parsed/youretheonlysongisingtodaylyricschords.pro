{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I was born to say the things I have to say
Some of us are lucky enough to [G7]be that way
[C]I found a phrase in [C7]every face of [F]yesterday[Fm]
Honey [C]you're the only [G7]song I sing [C]today
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I tried to find a word to rhyme with everything
And place it in a song that I [G7]could always sing
[C]You just didn't happen [C7]you were [F]dreamed this way[Fm]
And honey [C]you're the only [G7]song I sing [C]today
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]There's some kinda power somewhere [C]out of sight
And it [G7]lets a poet know it [C]when he said it right
[F]Like so many I've come close a [C]time or two
But all my lines I find were leading [G7]me to you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]I remember finding you a melody
Somewhere in the notes you wrote [G7]inside of me
[C]And it was tailored just to [C7]fit some words I [F]had to say[Fm]
And honey [C]you're the only [G7]song I sing [C]today
{end_of_verse}
