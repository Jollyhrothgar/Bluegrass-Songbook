{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]We both have fought the storms of life [D7]together
Many times it seemed our world was gonna [G]end
We've touched the thorns of life now we know [D7]better
And we're more in love now than we've ever [G]been
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
After The Storm    comes the [D7]sunshine
The clouds are gone  and the world is [G]tame
Into each life [G7]there will be [C]showers
But don't the [D7]world look brighter after the [G]rain
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well the sweetest love is when we're back [D7]together
And it's just like a second [G]honeymoon
And we've touched the thorns of life now we know [D7]better
And the rain just helps to make the roses [G]bloom
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
After The Storm    comes the [D7]sunshine
The clouds are gone  and the world is [G]tame
Into each life [G7]there will be [C]showers
But don't the [D7]world look brighter after the [G]rain
But don't the [D7]world look brighter after the [G]rain
{end_of_verse}
