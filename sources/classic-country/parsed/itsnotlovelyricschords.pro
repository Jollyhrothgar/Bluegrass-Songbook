No It's Not Love [C]not like ours was  it's not [G]love
but [C]it keeps [G]love from driving me [D7]mad
And [G]I don't have to [G7]wonder who she's [C]had
No it's [G]not love  [D]but it's not [G]bad
{end_of_verse}

I turn to her when you [G7]leave me [C]alone
sometimes [G]even when you're here and you're still [D7]gone

No  it's [G]not Love  [D7]but it's [G]not [G7]bad
