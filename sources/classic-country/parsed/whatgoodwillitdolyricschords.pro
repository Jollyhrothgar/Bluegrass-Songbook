{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I'll forgive you but what good will it [F]do
We would [G7]have those same old fights to go [C]through
And I'd much rather be dead
Than to [F]hear those words you said
I'll for[G7]give you but what good will it [C]do
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I still love you but what good will it [F]do
One can't [G7]make a go of love it takes [C]two
Oh you can't keep up a home
With a [F]heart that wants to roam
I still [G7]love you but what good will it [C]do
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I'll come back dear but what good would it [F]do
Cause it [G7]won't take you long to be un[C]true
That would mean another fight
On and [F]on into the night
I'll come [G7]back but what good will it [C]do
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I could blame you but what good will it [F]do
After [G7]all I can't tell you what to [C]do
We are born a certain way
Dear and [F]that's the way we stay
I could [G7]blame you but what good will it [C]do
{end_of_verse}
