{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I could stand out in the rain
[C]Smilin' as you drive [G]out [D7]of my [G]life
[C]I could [D7]wave goodbye all day 
And never [Dm]feel the pain that's cloudin' up my [G]mind
I could hear the saddest song [C]bout a love gone wrong 
And never [G]fall [D7]a-p[Em]art
It would [C]all be so easy [D7]if I didn't have a [G]heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I could [C]see you in the arms of someone new
And know I'd never have to wo[G]rry
I could [A7]turn my back and walk away
If you walked in right now and said you're [Am]sorr[D7]y
I could [G]pack away the memories
[C]Forget about the past and make a [G]brand [D7]new [Em]start
It would [C]all be so easy [D7]if I didn't have a [G]heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I could tuck her into bed
[C]Bow my head and never see your [G]face [D7]while she [G]prays
Give [C]her a goodnight [D7]kiss
And never [Dm]shed a tear when she cries out your [G]name 
And it wouldn't hurt at all
When [C]her little friends all ask me [G]where [D7]you [Em]are
It would [C]all be so easy [D7]if I didn't have a [G]heart
