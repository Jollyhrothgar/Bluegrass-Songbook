[C]I don't know exactly [G7]where our love went [C]wrong
There's so many things we [G7]both could blame it [C]on

Your lips are telling [G7]me to go [C]away
While your eyes are sayin' you [G7]want me to [C]stay
If your heart could read my mind 
You'd know [F]exactly what to do
You take a step toward [C]me 
[G7]I'd run a mile to [C]you

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
It [F]seems a shame to throw so many [C]happy years away
When [D7]just one simple I love you would [G7]cause us both to say
Let's [C]don't let pride destroy the dreams 
We [F]both know could come true
If you'd take a step toward [C]me 
[G7]I'd run a mile to [C]you
