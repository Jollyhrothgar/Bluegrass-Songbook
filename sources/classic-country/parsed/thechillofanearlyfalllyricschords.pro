{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G7]Well her [C]old friend [G7]from her [Am]old [C]end of [F]town dropped [C]by [G7]today
And [C]way down deep inside [G7]me [Am]something died [C]when he came [D7]around 
To see her that [F][G7]way
[G7]Here it [C]comes [Em]again that [Am]same old chilly wind [C]will [F]blow 
[C]Like a cold winter [D7]squall
I'll [C]begin to feel the [G7]chill of an [C]early [F][G7]fall
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And [C]I'll be drinking [Em]again and [Am]thinking whenever [C]he [F]calls
[C]There's [F]a [C]storm coming [Em]on 
And it [Am]won't be too [C]long till [D7]the snow [G7]falls
Oh [C]I'll be sober [Em]some but [Am]when October [C]comes and [C][F]goes 
In no time at [D7]all
I'll [C]begin to feel the [G7]chill of an early [C]fall

[G7]Now there's no [C]doubt  it's gonna [G7]be cold  [Am]out [F][C]tonight 
I've shivered all [G7][C]day
And [C]when I look in her [G7]eyes [Am]needin' to [C]hold her so [D7]tight
She just looks [F][G7]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[G7]Oh she'll [C]swear that it's [Em]true  [Am]he's just someone [C]she knew long [F]ago
[C]But I know that's not [D7]all
I'll [C]begin to feel the [G7]chill of an early [D7][Am]fall
Oh I'll [C]begin to feel the [G7]chill of an early [C][F]fall
