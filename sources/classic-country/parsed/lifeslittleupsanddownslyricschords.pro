{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I don't know how to tell her 
[F]I didn't get that raise in pay [C]today
And I [A]know how much she wanted 
That [F]dress in Baker's window
And it [C]breaks my heart to [F]see her have to [C]wait[F]
And cancel [C]all the plans she [F]made to cele[C]brate
I can [A]count on her to take it 
With a [F]smile and not a [C]frown
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
She knows life has its little ups and downs 
Like ponies on a merry go round
And no one [A]grabs a brass ring every [F]time 
But she don't [C]mind
She wears a [G7]gold ring on her [F]finger 
And I'm so glad that it's [C]mine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
New house plans we've had so long 
I [F]guess will gather dust another [C]year
And the [A]daffodils are blooming 
That she [F]planted way last fall upon the [C]hill [F]
Over by the [C]gate
[F]Lord knows I [C]hate to say [F]again we'll have to [C]wait
You can [A]bet she'll just take it with a [F]smile 
And not a [C]frown
