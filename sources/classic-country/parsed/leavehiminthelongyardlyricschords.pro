{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Yes he's looking kind of jaded
And his sight is not the best
And the hair around his [C7]muzzle's turning [F]grey
He [G7]has seen a hundred musters
And I think it's only fair
That we leave him in the longyard here [C]today
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
He was broken in the sixties
Maybe sixty three or four
Never faltered always [C7]seemed to be on [F]hand
Never [G7]have I seen him beaten
By a bullock in the bush
And at a night watch he was pick of all the [C]land
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
So leave him out there in the longyard
Do not rush him
Leave him out there with his mate the baldy [G7]bay
Leave him there till after smoko
And we'll catch him
Pull his tail and turn him out [C]today
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
He's entitled to some kindness
In return for all he's been
Now he's failing and his [C7]step is getting [F]slow
Let [G7]him squander his last summer
By the river with his mates
In the paddock where the sweetest grasses [C]grow
{end_of_verse}
