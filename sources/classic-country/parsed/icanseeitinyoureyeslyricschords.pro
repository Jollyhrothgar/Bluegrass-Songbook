[G]The first time I saw [Am]you I felt [D7]weak [G]inside
[Am]I searched my heart [D7]and mind for words I couldn't [G]find
[C]Somehow you seemed to see what [B7]came over me that [E7]night
[Am]As a love began [D7]to grow that would last for all [G]time

[Am]And you said I can see it in your eyes
[D7]They're the windows to your [G]soul
[Am]Sometimes they say [D7]more than words could ever [G]hold
[C]We could wait a thousand lifetimes [B7]and never feel like this [E7]again
[Am]But when you look at [D7]me that way I can see it in your [G]eyes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[Am]Later on I asked your hand and [D7]I prayed the time was [G]right
[Am]I knelt down on one knee [D7]and said would you be my [G]bride
[C]And the sound of silence filled the air as your [B7]tears fell with [E7]mine
[C]You didn't have to say [D7]a word for me to [G]realize

[Am]I see dreams come [D7]alive and future plans [G]unfold
[C]I could wait a thousand lifetimes and [B7]not find a perfect love [E7]again
[Am]But when you look at [D7]me that way I can see it in your [G]eyes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[Am]Many years have come and [D7]gone and what a life we've [G]made
[Am]How again we search for [D7]words as the heart inside me [G]breaks
[C]Until death do we part [B7]were the vows we [E7]made
[Am]And now the time has [D7]come but goodbye is so hard to [G]say
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
[Am]I can see [D7]it your eyes they're the windows to your [G]soul
[Am]The light of life is burning [D7]low soon you're leaving me I [G]know
[C]The time that's left is precious dear so [B7]please don't shed another [E7]tear
[C]You don't have to [D7]say a word I can see it in your [G]eyes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
