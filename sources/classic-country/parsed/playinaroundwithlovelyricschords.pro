{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Not too long [F]ago you said to [C]me 
I believe it's time you set me [F]free
Cause I found a woman who knows how to love me [C]right
And she [D7]don't mind if I lay out all [G7]night
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And you said [C]hallelujah [F]this woman sure gets to ya
[C]I finally [A7]found peace of [D7]mind
A singing [C]hallelujah [F]you don't know [D7]what good it'll do [C]ya
Playin' around with love'll [G7]do it every [C]time [G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
But [C]then one day she [F]felt like movin' [C]on
One goodbye and you were all [F]alone
And it's funny but I could almost hear the [C]sound
When your [D7]whole world came tumblin' to the [G7]ground
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
And I said [C]hallelujah [F]that woman socked it to ya
[C]Just walked away and [A7]blew your [D7]mind
A singing [C]hallelujah [F]you've got [D7]what's comin' [C]ya
Playin' around with love'll [G7]do it every [C]time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
But it seems that I'm [F]not too satis[C]fied
With the brand new love [E7]that's walking by my [F]side
Cause already there's an old love on my [C]mind [F]
[C]Playin' around with [D7]love'll do it [G7]every [F]tim[C]e
{end_of_verse}
