{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Everybody told me what a fool I [D7]was
To fall in love with someone who would never be [G]true
But someday I would wind up with the hopeless [D7]love
All alone be wilted and [G]confused
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
So who'll be the first to say I told you [D7]so
Cause I'm alone like they all said I'd [G]be
Who'll be the first to say I should have listened long [D7]ago
So who'll be the first to say I told you [G]so
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Filled with love so strong that ruled my heart and [D7]soul
Blinded by the lies you kept on telling to [G]me
People saw the things you've done and let me [D7]know
Things a fool in love can never [G]see
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
So who'll be the first to say I told you [D7]so
Cause I'm alone like they all said I'd [G]be
Who'll be the first to say I should have listened long [D7]ago
So who'll be the first to say I told you [G]so
