[C]You've got to run to [F]win the [C]race

Our Lord is [F]testing us each [C]day

You got to bear a cross if you [G7]want to wear a [C]crown

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
You've seen some men [F]rise to the [C]top

They blame the Lord above and they [G7]never blame them[C]selves

Out of these [F]fallen some will [C]rise
Accept their [F]fate and rea[G7]lize

That you got to bear the cross if you [G7]want to wear a [C]crown
