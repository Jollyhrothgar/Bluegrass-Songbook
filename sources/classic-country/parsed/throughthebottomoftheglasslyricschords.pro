So turn off the [F]jukebox dim down the [C]lights
I don’t need no [D7]vision twenty twenty [G7]tonight
So I won’t [C]see her even [C7]if they walk [F]past
Through the jokes and the [C]tears
Through the [A7]smoke and the [D7]beers
Through the [G7]bottom of the [C]glass [F]   [C]

Well she ain’t much to [C]see but [A7]she looks good to [D7]me
Through the [G7]bottom of the [C]glass [F]   [C]
