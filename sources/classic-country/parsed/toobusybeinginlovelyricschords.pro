{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]If I had taken the [Dm]time to write down a few [Em]lines
Every [C]time that you [F]crossed this [G7]heart of [C]mine
I'd put them all in a [Dm]book
How much time would that have [Em]took
The words 'n years have a [F]way of [G7]slipping [Am]back
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh [Dm]no  [G7]too [C]bad [Am]there [Dm]goes the [F]chance that I [G7]had
I could have [C]written a [Am]play so [F]sweet and so [G7]funny
Given old [C]Mr. Shakespeare a [F]run for his [G7]money
[Am]Written the [Em]words to the [F]prettiest tune
That [C]would never leave a dry [F]eye in the [G7]room
My [Am]only [F]excuse for not [G7]doing [Am]enough
[F]Well I was too [C]busy [G7]being in [Am]love
Yes [F]I was too [C]busy [G7]being in [C]love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Brand new phrases [Dm]appear every time you are [Em]near
All these words you [F]inspire after [G7]all these [C]years
But I never reached for a [Dm]pen
Break the mood that I'm [Em]in
Before I knew it the [F]words [G7]were gone [Am]again

The [Am]beautiful [Em]song and it [F]starts with your name
[C]Written my way into [F]fortune and [G7]fame
But I [Am]have no [F]regrets for not [G7]doing [Am]enough
