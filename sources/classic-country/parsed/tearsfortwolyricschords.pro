{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Luck found me too [D7]late to [F]be what I could [C]use
And caught me tempting [D7]fate still red [F]handed and con[C]fused
Pride has sent me [D7]where there's [F]not much left to [C]lose
The cruelly let me [D7]care and [F]convinced me I could [C]chose
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
About [G7]you as if [F]there was one small [C]chance
To be [G7]through with [F]everything I [C]can't
So even if this worn out heart was new
And all it's foolish [G7]hopes were [C]true
This one lifetime just won't do
Cause I've cried enough [G7]tears  for [C]two
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Dreaming only [D7]served to [F]take my restless [C]sleep
Stealing comfort from these [D7]eyes so [F]desperate for [C]relief
Fueled by empty [D7]promises they [F]never meant to [C]keep
Leaving me with [D7]nothing more than [F]endless years to [C]weep
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
About [G7]you as if [F]there was one small [C]chance
To be [G7]through with [F]everything I [C]can't
So even if this worn out heart was new
And all it's foolish [G7]hopes were [C]true
This one lifetime just won't do
Cause I've cried enough [G7]tears  for [C]two
{end_of_verse}
