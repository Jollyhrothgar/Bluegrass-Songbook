[F]You're here every night severing up the [G7]drinks
Wearing your superficial [C]smile

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You still wear the wedding band and your left hard working hand
For a memory of a man [C7]who's chained and [F]bound
Lord knows you need a man and an understanding [C]hand
Before you run [G7]completely out of [C]love

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
That cold December day they took her man away
Never dreaming of a gentle heart they [G7]broke
[F]Now she waits by the phone she waits there all [G7]alone
But the only one who ever calls is [C]me 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Now I'm a prisoner of a slave to one way love
I wish they'd let me go [C7]so I'd be [F]free
Break these chains that binds and release this heart of [C]mine
Before I run [G7]completely out of [C]love
{end_of_verse}
