{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]In the cold Canadian waters [F]north from the coast of Maine
There's an [C]island called Newfoundland swept by snow wind and [G7]rain 
On the [C]island there's a [F]village with its [C]customs and its [F]ways
The little town of [C]Carmanville my [G7]home of childhood [C]days
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Those childhood days were something [F]carefree all the time
There's a [C]girl in every story and you know there's one in [G7]mine 
She [C]broke my heart so [F]often and it [C]stays a little [F]sore
That's the reason [C]I left home and [G7]can't go back no [C]more  [C7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Where the [F]people make a living on the land and on the sea
There are [C]people on the island that mean the world to [G7]me 
I [C]wish I had the [F]power to [C]change the course of [F]time
And live again in [C]Newfoundland my [G7]home of childhood [C]times
Spoken:
I'd like to watch the fishing boats as they [F]sail across the bay
To [C]see again the farmers sow his seeds and cut the [G7]hay 
Well this [C]island has no [F]strangers cause [C]everybody is your [F]friend
This little isle called [C]Newfoundland [G7]oh I'd sure love to see it [C]again
