{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]In the corner of my mind stands a [D7]jukebox
It's playing all my favorite [G]memories
One by one they take me [G7]back
To the [C]days when you were [Am]mine
And [D7]I can't stop this jukebox in my [G]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I don't need no quarters don't need any [D7]dime
You filled it up forever  when you said [G]goodbye
Heaven knows I love old [G7]melodies
They were [C]meant to ease the [Am]pain
But the kind that's playing on [A7]my mind
Are driving me [D7]insane
