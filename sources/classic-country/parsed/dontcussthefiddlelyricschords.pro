I'd [G7]heard that he'd been scandalizin' me 
And Lord I knew that that was [C]wrong

And feelin' fool enough to [F]see
What [G7]I had called my brother 
On now he had every right to call on [C]me

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
If we ever get to heaven boys 
It ain't because we ain't done nothin' [F]wrong
We're [G7]in this gig together so let's settle down 
And steal each others [C]song

Bitterly away the after[F]noon
And [G7]soon enough he turned on me 
Like he'd done every face in that [C]saloon
{end_of_verse}

And said he couldn't even steal a decent [F]song
But [G7]soon as it was spoken 
He was sad enough to wish that we were [C]wrong
