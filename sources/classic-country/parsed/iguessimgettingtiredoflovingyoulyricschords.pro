[C]My eyes don’t see you any[G7]more

My heart don’t hurt the way it [G7]used to do
I guess I’m gettin’ tired of loving [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
My sleep ain’t bothered by your [G7]dreams
And my mind ain’t filled with your [F]memo[C]ries
You’ll never know the change I’m [G7]going through
I guess I’m gettin’ tired of loving [C]you

I guess [F]I’m gettin’ tired of you being too [C]tired for [G7]me
These [F]nights are so long
When there’s somewhere else [D7]that you’d much rather [G7]be
So go [C]on and live your life the [G7]way you choose
I guess I’m gettin’ tired of loving [C]you
{end_of_verse}

I guess I’m gettin’ tired of loving [C]you
