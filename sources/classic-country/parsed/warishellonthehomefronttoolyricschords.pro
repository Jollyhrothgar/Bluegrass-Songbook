{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]It was July hot in Georgia in 1942   
[F]All the men were off to war
and the women had nothing to [C]do
I was 16 and hungry lookin’ for my first taste of love
When I [G7]brought her groceries to her door 
I didn’t know how close I [C]was
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Her long blonde hair was flowing 
And she smelled like sweet perfume
[F]When I laid her groceries down
she said you don’t have to leave so [C]soon
A woman sure gets lonely when her man’s gone off to fight
She [G7]reached out for my tremblin’ hand
As tear drops filled her [C]eyes
And she [G7]said
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]War is hell on the homefront too
[F]God only knows what a woman goes through
[G7]She still needs what her man that’s gone can’t [C]do
I can’t fight this fire alone
[F]Stay with me until it’s gone
[G7]Ooh war is hell on the homefront [C]too
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
It was July hot inside me as she led me to the bedroom door
The [F]satin sheets and pleasure
I never knew I could feel be[C]fore
My first taste of lovin’ was everything it shoulda been
When a wo[G7]man’s fightin’ loneliness
It’s a battle she can’t w[C]in
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I’ll always remember what she did and what she said
But the [G7]one thing I remember most
Is the way she turned his picture over
Face down on the table by her [C]bed
And how she [G7]said
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]War is hell on the homefront too
[F]God only knows what a woman goes through
[G7]She still needs what her man that’s gone can’t [C]do
I can’t fight this fire alone
[F]Stay with me until it’s gone
[G7]Ooh war is hell on the homefront [C]too
{end_of_verse}
