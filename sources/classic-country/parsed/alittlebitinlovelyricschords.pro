{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I don't fall in love as a rule
Cause it always made me [D7]look like a [G]fool
Well it [C]keeps me up late I can't concentrate
And I [G]pride myself on keeping my cool
But I've [D7]got to admit that I'm 
A little bit in love with [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Now I don't want you gettin' me wrong
Because I don't sit up at [D7]night by the [G]phone
But then [C]you come around I let my guard down
[G]And I can't seem to leave you alone
But I'll [D7]get over it I'm just 
A little bit in love with [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well I [C]tell myself that a [G]little bit of love
Can't [D7]hurt a big girl like [G]me
But I [C]never have heard of a [G]little heartache
And [A7]baby that's what's scarin' [D7]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
So don't you [G]get your hopes up if I call
Because I [C]always catch myself when I fall
But I've [D7]got to admit that I'm 
A little bit in love with [G]you [D7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
So don't you [G]get your hopes up if I call
Because I [C]always catch myself when I fall
But I've [D7]got to admit that I'm 
A little bit in love with [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Yes I've [D7]got to admit that I'm 
A little bit in love with [G]you
But I've [D7]got to admit that I'm 
A little bit in love with [G]you
