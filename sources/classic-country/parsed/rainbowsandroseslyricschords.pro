{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]A rainbow always shows up [G7]when a storm is through
To decorate a fresh green world [C]where life can start anew
Then the roses show their glory and the [F]sun comes shining through
But there's no [G7]rainbows or no roses in my stormy world with [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh I know I'd see the rainbows and the [G7]roses
If the storm that's raging in our world would [C]end
Why can't we be happy like we [G7]used to
And bring the [F]rainbows and the [G7]roses back [C]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I don't know what happened  [G7]to the love we knew
I wouldn't care what happened now [C]if I knew what to do
To part these clouds of sadness and [F]bring the sunshine through
So the [G7]rainbows and the roses would come back for me and [C]you
{end_of_verse}

And bring the [F]rainbows and the [G7]roses back [C]again
