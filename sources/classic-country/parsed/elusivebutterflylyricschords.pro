{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]You might wake up some [Dm]morning
To the [G7]sound of something moving past your window in the [C]wind
And if you're [Dm]quick enough to [G7]rise
You'll catch the [Dm]fleeting glimpse of [G7]someone's fading [C]shadow
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Out on [Dm]the new [G7]horizon you may see 
The floating motion of a distant pair of [C]wings
And if the [Dm]sleep has left your [G7]ears
You might hear [Dm]footsteps running [G7]through an open [C]meadow
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Don't be concerned [Dm]it [G7]will not harm [C]you
It's only [G7]me pursuing something I'm not sure [C]of
Across my [Dm]dreams [G7]with nets [C]of wonder
I chase the [G7]bright elusive butterfly of [C]love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
You might have heard my [Dm]footsteps
In the distance through the canyons [C]of your mind
I might [Dm]have even called [G7]your name 
As I ran [Dm]searching after [G7]something to [C]believe in 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
You might have seen me [Dm]running
through the long
Abandoned ruins of the dreams [C]you left behind
If you [Dm]remember something [G7]there
That glided [Dm]past you followed close [G7]by heavy [C]breathing
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Don't be concerned [Dm]it [G7]will not harm [C]you
It's only [G7]me pursuing something I'm not sure [C]of
Across my [Dm]dreams [G7]with nets [C]of wonder
I chase the [G7]bright elusive butterfly of [C]love
{end_of_verse}
