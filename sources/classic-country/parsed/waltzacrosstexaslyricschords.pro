{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]When we dance together my world's in [D7]disguise
It's a fairy-land tale that's come [G]true
And when you look at me with those stars in your [D7]eyes
I could waltz across Texas with [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Waltz across Texas with you in my [D7]arms
Waltz across Texas with [G]you
Like a story-book ending I'm lost in your [D7]charms
And I could waltz across Texas with [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
My heartaches and troubles are just up and [D7]gone
The moment that you come in [G]view
And with your hand in mine dear I could dance on and [D7]on
I could waltz across Texas with [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Waltz across Texas with you in my [D7]arms
Waltz across Texas with [G]you
Like a story-book ending I'm lost in your [D7]charms
And I could waltz across Texas with [G]you
{end_of_verse}
