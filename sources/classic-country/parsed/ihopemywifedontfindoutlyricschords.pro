{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I finally found a woman that I [D7]care for
She's taught me what true love is all [G]about
She's given me a reason now for [C]living 
And [D7]I just hope my wife don't find [G]out
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Yes the [C]woman that I love with 
And the [G]woman that I live with
Are as [A7]different as a whisper and a [D7]shout
I [G]finally found somebody 
Who [C]makes my life worthwhile
And [D7]I just hope my wife don't find [G]out
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
If it wasn't for the kids I guess I'd [D7]leave her
For we both forgot what happiness is [G]about
And to make things even worse I found [C]another
And [D7]I just hope my wife don't find [G]out
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Yes the [C]woman that I love with 
And the [G]woman that I live with
Are as [A7]different as a whisper and a [D7]shout
I [G]finally found somebody 
Who [C]makes my life worthwhile
And [D7]I sure hope my wife don't find [G]out
{end_of_verse}
