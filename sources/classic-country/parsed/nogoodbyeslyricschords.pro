{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G7]Come and [C]sit down here beside me 
Let me [F]see that [C]smile
I was just reliving some good [G7]times
Do you [C]remember that first date

And we [C]promised [G7] there'd be no good[C]byes[C7]

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And [F]together we'd soar [Dm]over the [C]mountains of life
Some [D7]good times and some sad times
[F]We took it all in [G7]stride
With [C]you there beside me Lord I [F]loved every [A7]mile
And there's no [C]reason for [G7]any good[C]byes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G7]You know [C]time moves so swiftly 
In the [F]blink of an [C]eye
A lifetime could just pass you on [G7]by
But love like [C]ours goes on forever 
And [F]beyond the end of [A7]time
So there's no [C]reason for [G7]any good[C]byes[C7]
{end_of_verse}

And there's no [C]reason for [G7]any good[C]byes [G7]   [F]
