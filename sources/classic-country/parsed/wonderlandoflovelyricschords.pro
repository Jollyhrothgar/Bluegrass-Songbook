[C]What kind of world would it [F]be for [C]you without me
Would you think it a [A#7]better world or would you be lonely[G7]
And [C]if your love for me shall [F]die would you [C]even say goodbye
Or would you just [A#7]walk away into the dark of [C]night
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Some[G7]times I need a[F]ssurance of your [C]love
For your [A#7]soft and gentle touch
All the kings are worthy of[G7]
And at these times you [F]take me by the [C]hand
And like a [A#7]child you lead me through
A wonderland of [C]love

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Life I can't visua[F]lize without [C]you by my side
Life would be [A#7]meaningless like some of those skies[G7]
Though you [C]show me every day your love in every way
I'm afraid it's all a [A#7]dream that'll favor our [C]way
