[C]Last night I came home again [Am]three sheets to the [G7]wind
[F]Broke the promise I [G7]swore I'd never [G7][C]break
[C]And it came as [G7]no surprise to [Am]see the hurt in her [C]eyes
[F]Or the bible on the [G7]table where she [C]prayed
[Am]This time I [G7]thought for sure that [F]she was good as [C]gone
[Am]But she just wiped her tears [G7]away and [F]put some coffee [G7]on

[C]And I don't know [Em]why she [F]even hangs [C]around
[Em]After all the hell I put her through
[C]And the [F]times I've let her [G7]down
[C]She has more faith in me than anyone [F]has ever [Am]found
[C]Heaven knows how much I need [G7]her thank God for [Am]believers
{end_of_verse}

[C]She says boy I [G7]still love you she's [Am]stronger then the ninety [G7]proof
[F]I sent [G7]coursing through [C]my [G7]veins
[C]She says don't give up [G7]the fight before [Am]long you'll get it [G7]right
[F]I wish to God that [G7]I could feel the [C]same
[Am]Sunday [G7]morning here [F]beside her in the [C]pew
[Am]Through blood shot [G7]eyes I try to [F]see her point of [G7]view
