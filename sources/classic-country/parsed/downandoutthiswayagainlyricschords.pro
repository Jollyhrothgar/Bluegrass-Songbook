[C]My life is not the [F]life you were [G7]accustomed to
You’re ashamed of all the common things I [F]say and [C]do [F]   [C]
You act as though we [C7]never met when [F]I pass you on the [D7]street
I was [G7]something you could walk on till you got back on your [C]feet

The songs you sing are [F]not the kind of [G7]songs that rhyme
Your goals are set much higher than I’ll [F]ever [C]climb [F]   [C]
But the gravel road I [C7]offered you is [F]where the high road [D7]ends
If you’re [G7]ever down and out this way [C]again

If you ever need [F]somebody you can [D7]walk on 
Look me [F]up and you’ll [G7]know just where I’ll [C]b-[G7]e

If you’re [G7]ever down and out this way [C]again
{end_of_verse}
