[C]I was slowly passing an orphan's home one [F]day
And [C]stopped there for a moment [D7]just to watch the children [G7]play
A [C]lonely boy was standing and when I asked him [F]why
He [C]turned with eyes that could not see and he [G7]began to [C]cry

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I'm nobody's child I’m [C7]nobody's [F]child
[G7]I’m like a flower just growing [C]wild
No mommy’s kisses no [C7]daddy's [F]smile
[G7]Nobody wants me I'm nobody's [C]child

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
People come for children and take them for their [F]own
But [C]they all seem to pass me by [D7]and leave me all [G7]alone
I [C]know they'd like to take me but when they see I'm [F]blind
They [C]always take some other child and I am [G7]left [C]behind

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
No mommy’s arms to hold me or sooth me when I [F]cry
[C]Sometimes it gets so lonely here [D7]I wish that I could [G7]die

And [C]just like all the other kids there’d [G7]be a home for [C]me

{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
And they tell me I’m so [C]pretty
And they seem to like my big curls [F]of gold
But then they take some other little [C]child
And I’m [G7]left here all [C]alone

[G7]Nobody wants me I'm nobody's [C]child
