{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Come walk with me down lover’s [G7]lane
Where we once walked to[C]gether
For old time sake I’m asking of [G7]you dear
Then I’ll go away for[C]ever
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
This little band of gold I’ll keep it for[G7]ever
As a token of a love that never could [C]be
It’s the story of my life a past with no [G7]future
And all that is left is a sad memo[C]ry
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I think of a [F]life we could have to[C]gether
And dream of a [F]past that wouldn’t have [G7]last
So come walk with [C]me down lovers [G7]lane
Then I’ll go away for[C]ever
{end_of_verse}
