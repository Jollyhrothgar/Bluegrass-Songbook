{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]My [F]hands are shaking as [G7]I'm sadly [C]learnin'
The [F]truth behind your [G7]innocent [C]disguise
You [F]never thought I knew that [G7]you had been [Am]untrue
But I [D7]once saw the devil somewhere in your [G7]eyes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Now [F]you got the nerve to ask [G7]me where I'm [C]goin'
And [F]I don't believe I'd [G7]tell you if I [C]knew
I'll [F]be gone when the [G7]sun comes up [Am][C]tomorrow
I [F]believe it's time to [G7]say goodbye to [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And it [G7]sure smells like [F]snow in Bossier [C]City
But there [D7]ain't no weather quite as cold as [G7]you
I'd [F]sooner stand in [G7]mother nature's [Am][C]anger
Than to [F]spend another [G7]lonely night with [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I'm [F]talking but I'm [G7]feeling you're not [C]listenin'
[F]My words they just [G7]fall heavy on the [C]floor
Yes it's true [F]that you knew I would not [G7]stay [Am]forever
[D7]You won't see me cryin' when I walk out your [G7]door
{end_of_verse}
