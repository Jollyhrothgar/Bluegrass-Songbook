{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I fell in love on a moonlit night
In the blue moon light of old [G7]Mexicali
I kissed red lips neath the blossoms of white
In the blue moon light and I was so [C]happy
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Because I was happy I broke the vows I made to [F]another
And [D7]I made promises I couldn't [G7]keep
Now [C]I'm alone in the silent night
And as blue moon light touches my [G7]pillow   I [C]weep
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I weep for the heart that I've broken apart
And the shame in my soul never [G7]dies
For I promised that I'd be returning but I knew I was saying goodbye
For I wasn't free God forgive me only He knows what I feel [C]inside
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}

And [D7]I made promises I couldn't [G7]keep
Now [C]I'm alone in the silent night
