And God will [G]wipe all these [D7]teardrops from our [G]eyes

We're here today we'll be gone [C]tomorrow
And this [G]life won't even be a [D7]memory
We're [G]here today we'll be gone [C]tomorrow
There we'll [G]praise the Lord [D7]throughout [G]eternity
{end_of_verse}

And the [G]sounding of His [D7]trumpets will be [G]gone
