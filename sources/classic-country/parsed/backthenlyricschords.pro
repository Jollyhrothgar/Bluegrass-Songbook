{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I've loved you for so [G7]long that it's [C]hard for me to change
And I know since you're not [A7]here there's [D7]some things to [G7]rearrange
But I [C]keep on dreaming that [C7]someday you [F]just might come back again
[D7]Oh and I want everything to be the [G7]way it [F]was back [G7]then
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]Back [D7]then [G7]our [C]love would start through the [A#7]kiss and morning [A7]coffee
Good [D7]mornin' darlin' did [G7]you sleep all [C]right
[G7]Back [D7]then [F]my [C]day was made [A#7]with the memory [A7]of your lovin'
And the [F]promise that you'd [G7]be lovin' me [C]tonight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
It's so strange what can [G7]happen how the [C]good things can go wrong
Like one day you were [A7]with me the [D7]next day you were [G7]gone
But a [C]million golden [C7]memories [F]can't bring you back again
[D7]Oh I trade them all to change things to the [G7]way they [F]were back [G7]then
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[F]Back [D7]then [G7]our [C]love would start through the [A#7]kiss and morning [A7]coffee
Good [D7]mornin' darlin' did [G7]you sleep all [C]right
[G7]Back [D7]then [F]my [C]day was made [A#7]with the memory [A7]of your lovin'
And the [F]promise that you'd [G7]be lovin' me [C]tonight
{end_of_verse}
