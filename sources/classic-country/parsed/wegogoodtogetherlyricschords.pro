And we're [G7]burnin' a path across the [C]world we're lovin' in
With [G7]tender words and happy songs we're [C]singin'
We're [G7]glidin' over troubles with the [C]ease of birds that fly
And [F]every day's a [G7]lovin' day and [C]that's [G7]the reason [C]why

We walk through meadows [F]hand in hand with [G7]love that's over[C]flowin'
The flowers turn their [F]faces up and [G7]tell us that it's [C]showin'

Then we [F]stop and think [G7]about our love and [C]sing [G7]our song [C]again
