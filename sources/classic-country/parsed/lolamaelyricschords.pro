{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]This Texas black land cotton farm
Was never ever quite your cup of [F]tea
I've [G7]seen the way your eyes light
Looking at those movie maga[C]zines
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Your nights are filled with satin dreams
As you lay upon our cotton [F]sheets
And [G7]Lola Mae I knew someday  
Those dreams would take you far away from [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I don't know where you got that dress
But it makes you look to good to be [F]true
[G7]Honey you don't have to chase your dreams
In LA they'll come chasing after [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
You'd fly away on silver wings
If you wait till my crops come [F]true
But [G7]Lola Mae you just can't wait
I guess a Greyhound Bus will have to [C]do
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
But [F]Lola Mae remember life ain't 
Always the it looks in those [G7]magazines
[F]Hollywood behind the scenes 
Is just a place where angels lose their [G7]wings
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
[C]But I'll still be here to come home to
If your dreams in LA should fall [F]through
But [G7]Lola Mae just keep in mind
My love is all I'll have to offer [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Yes [G7]Lola Mae just keep in mind
My love is all I'll have to offer [C]you
{end_of_verse}
