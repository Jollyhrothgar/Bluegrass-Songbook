{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]It was a long time ago no shoes on my [F]feet
I walked ten miles of [G7]train track to hear Hank Williams [C]sing
His body was worn but his spirit was [F]free
And he sang every [G7]song looking right straight at [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I'm just a tramp on your street
Hank you must under[F]stand
You've got my soul at your [G7]feet
Oh and my heart in your [C]hand
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now I don't have to think and I don't have to [F]cheat
Oh I don't have to [G7]win and I don't want to [C]lose
If I make any hay I'd just float a[F]way
I don't count on [G7]tomorrow I just live for [C]today
{end_of_verse}

Oh and my heart in your [C]hand

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]Hank you opened your heart
And you let me in[F]side
And made a stray dog like [G7]me
Feel welcome [C]tonight
