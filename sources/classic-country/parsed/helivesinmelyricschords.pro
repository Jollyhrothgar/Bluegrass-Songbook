{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Oh I’m just not myself although I look the same
The [F]portrait that I used to be is in a different frame
I [C]feel this sudden strength but I’m as helpless as a child
And [G7]you may see me [F]grinnin’ like it’s [G7]goin’ out of style
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The [C]things I used to treasure just get in the way
The [F]people I once hated I Love them more each day

Since [G7]Jesus came [F]into my heart and [G7]turned my life a round

My [G7]life is His [F]Kingdom my [G7]heart is His throne
He [C]lives in me (He lives in me)
He [F]lives in me (He lives in me)
The [G7]King of all Heaven and earth is living in [C]me

Now even when I’m tempted good and evil are at war
The [F]battle’s getting longer than it’s ever been before
Oh [C]I know where my strength lies I can’t do it on my own
Then [G7]I get rein[F]forcements cause I’m [G7]never left alone
