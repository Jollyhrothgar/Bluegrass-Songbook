{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]There's a girl in a barroom  [C]we all know her [G]well
Her name fits the stories that [A7]some men like to [D7]tell
[G]She may be young and pretty with lips red as [C]wine
A girl who's eyes [G]reflect the years no [D7]make-up can [G]hide
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
In her [C]world walk the lonely the [G]rejected and condemned
It's a [A7]world that once entered there's no [D7]turning back again
Like a [G]rose that lies crushed and [C]crumpled on the [G]sand
She was created by heaven now [D7]destroyed by [G]man
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
De[C]stroyed by man and the [G]love that she gave
Lost unless heaven counts her [A7]worthy to [D7]save
[C]Men don't respect her [G]still they hold her hand
She was created by heaven now [D7]destroyed by [G]man
{end_of_verse}
