{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Have you ever been a fool
Have you ever tried to [G7]break all the rules
And did you find out how it feels
To lose a love that's real
Have you ever been a [C]fool
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Have you ever played the part
Of the one who breaks [G7]everybody's heart
Till the day you break your own
And you wind up all alone
Have you ever been a [C]fool
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Have you ever been too [F]blind
To see the hurt you left [C]behind
All the damage that you've [D7]done
All the while you had your [G7]fun
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Have you ever looked [C]around
And watched your castles as they [G7]tumble to the ground
Then you'll know just what it's like
To feel like me tonight 
Have you ever been a [C]fool
{end_of_verse}
