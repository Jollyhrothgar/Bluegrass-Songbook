{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Hey I was out last night started a fight
Feeling bad this morning and a looking a sight
Stumblin' and a bummin' and feelin' for the knob of my [G7]door
Cause I [C]just can't live that [G7]fast any[C]more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Well I remember when the fun begin
Noon the next day before I come in
And the morning never bothered me after the night [G7]before
But I [C]just can't live that [G7]fast any[C]more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well take a look at me
And you can see that that fast living brings misery
Just a messed up rick at the end with blood shot [G7]eyes
Man you [C]just can't live that [G7]fast and get [C]by
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Take my advice think it over twice
Live real slow and be real nice
You better heed this warning I'm giving you in this [G7]song
Cause you [C]just can't live that [G7]fast very [C]long
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Well I remember back when the fun begin
Noon the next day before I come in
And the morning never bothered me after the night [G7]before
But I [C]just can't live that [G7]fast any[C]more
{end_of_verse}
