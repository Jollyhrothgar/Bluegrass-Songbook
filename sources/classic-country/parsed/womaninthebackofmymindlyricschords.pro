{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I see my wife working ironing my shirts
And my mind goes to another [F]day
And to another woman who might've [G7]been my wife
If things hadn't turned out this [C]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Lord knows I love her but I often wonder
If fate should pull back [F]the blind
How would my [G7]wife feel if she could see
The woman in the back of my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Does she do things fancy does she have a family
Is she as happy [F]as I
Does she spend her afternoons just [G7]playing bridge
Or baking the children a [C]pie
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
And I often wonder if she thinks of me
When she hears those old church bells [F]chime
Though it's been long [G7]ago at times I miss her so
The woman in the back of my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Suddenly I come back to right here and now
And the dreams that I've seen [F]come to life
And I hope she's as [G7]happy with somebody else
As I am with my loving [C]wife
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
I might have been wrong but it's been so long
And things work out in [F]time
But I'd like to say I'm [G7]sorry some day
To the woman in the back of my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}
