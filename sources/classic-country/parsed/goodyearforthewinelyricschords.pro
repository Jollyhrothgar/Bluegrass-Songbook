{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Some people say I [D7]drink because you left [G]me
[D7]And they say that wine won't drown your [G]memory
[G7]But the reason that I drink [C]is not to get you off my [A7]mind
[D7]I just heard this was a good year for the [G]wine

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]It doesn't bother me now that you're gone
[D7]And I haven't thought about you in so long

[D7]I just heard this was a good year for the [G]wine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[D7]It's not the neon lights that drove me to this [G]tavern
[D7]Or the lonely sound you're running to [G]inside
[G7]It's not my losing you that [C]keeps me drinking all the [A7]time
[D7]I just heard this was a good year for the [G]wine
{end_of_verse}
