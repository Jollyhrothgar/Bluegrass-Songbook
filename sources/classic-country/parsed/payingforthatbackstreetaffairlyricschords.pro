{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Yes I thought that you were true when I [C]fell in love with [G]you
[D7]For you told me you always would play [G]square
[C]Then I learned you had a home that your wife had not gone [D7]wrong
[G]And our love was just a [D7]back street [G]affair
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]Twas too late to say no when I found you'd fooled me [G]so
[D7]For as time passed on I'd learned so much to [G]care
[C]Though I knew I must atone but my will was not [D7]my own
[G]And I'm paying for that [D7]back street [G]affair
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]You didn't count the cost you gambled and I [G]lost
[D7]Now I must pay with hours of deep [G]despair
[C]You still can live your life with a true forgiving [D7]wife
[G]But I can't live down a [D7]back street [G]affair
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]The love I gave so free is left to torture [G]me
[D7]Though I know it's hopeless and it isn't [G]fair
[C]But still I must go on while the gossips spread our [D7]wrong
[G]I'm paying for that [D7]back street [G]affair
{end_of_verse}
