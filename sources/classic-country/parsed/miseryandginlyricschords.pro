Tonight I need that woman again
What I'd give for my baby to just walk [F]in

But here I am again mixing [C7]misery and [F]gin
Sitting with [G7]all my friends and talking to [C]myself
I [F]look like I'm having a good time but any [E7]f--ool can [F]tell
That this [C]Honkytonk Heaven really makes you [G7]f-eel like [C]hell
