{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]He bought three hundred acres ten miles south of town
A [G7]drifter who decided it was time to settle [C]down
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
There was no sea he had not sailed a sky he had not flown
And the [G7]only place he'd never been was a [F]place he could call his [C]own
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
He broke the soil and planted seed but the land refused to yield
And [G7]the loneliness he felt at night was the kind no man should [C]feel
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Till a woman came into his life a daughter of a soil
A [G7]bride that he could stand beside and [F]ease his daily [C]toil
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
And he [F]called his [G7]kingdom Jason's [C]Farm
The land [G7]grew rich and green for king Jason and his [C]queen
And the [G7]wind blew sweet each night time as they lay [F]in each others [C]arms
And all [G7]things good [F]grew on Jason's [C]Farm
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
When the summer sun had finally gone and the harvest time was near
[G7]Jason's pretty Mary whispered magic in his [C]ear
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Then Jason's laughter filled the land and his soul began to sing
And he [G7]boasted of a son his wife would bear [F]him in the [C]spring
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
And all [F]things good [G7]grew on Jason's [C]Farm
The [G7]land beneath the skies turned as green as Mary's [C]eyes
And he [G7]felt the child grow strong in Mary's [F]womb against his [C]palm
And all [G7]things good [F]grew on Jason's [C]Farm
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 9}
Spoken:
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 10}
Now the Lord gives and he takes away and to all men this is true
And most [G7]of us accept it and we learn to live it [C]through
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 11}
God gave a child to Jason an extension of his life
But in [G7]doing so He traded the [F]child for Jason's [C]wife
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 12}
The crops are rotting in the fields the land left unattended
And [G7]somewhere Jason roams the earth his wounded heart [C]unmended
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 13}
And the house is slowly falling down and the dust of Jason's yard
A [G7]monument to a man who shunned his [F]child and cursed his [C]God
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 14}
And nothing [F]grows no [G7]more on Jason's [C]Farm
The [G7]land once rich and green is dead and dry like Jason's [C]dream
And [G7]the wind that once blew sweet through Mary's [F]hand is strangely [C]calm
And nothing [G7]grows no [F]more on Jason's [C]Farm
{end_of_verse}
