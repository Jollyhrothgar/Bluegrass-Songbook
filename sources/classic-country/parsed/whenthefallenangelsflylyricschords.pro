{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I have climbed so many [G7]mountains  just to reach the other [C]side
And I've near drowned myself in [G7]freedom  just to feed my foolish [C]pride
On [C7]my journey through the [F]darkness  I have finally seen the [C]light
I know no one's ever [G7]loved me  like you're loving me [C]tonight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
There is something you must [G7]tell me  you think I won't under[C]stand
How you found such worldly [G7]pleasures  in the arms of other [C]men
I [C7]would never try to [F]judge you  we have both been wrong and [C]right
But I know no one's ever [G7]loved you  like I'm loving you [C]tonight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C7]God will save His fallen [F]angels  and their broken wings He'll [C]mend
When He draws their hearts [D7]together  and they learn to love [G7]again
All their sins will be [F]forgiven  in the twinkle of an [C]eye
All the saints rejoice in [G7]Heaven  when the fallen angels [C]fly
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
There's a story in the [G7]bible  about the eagle growing [C]old
How it grows new sets of [G7]feathers  then becomes both young and [C]strong
Then [C7]it spreads it's mighty [F]wingspan  out across the open [C]sky
We will have the wings of [G7]eagles  when the fallen angels [C]fly
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
When [C7]the fallen angels [F]fly  when the fallen angels [C]fly
We will have the wings of [G7]eagles  when the fallen angels [C]fly
{end_of_verse}
