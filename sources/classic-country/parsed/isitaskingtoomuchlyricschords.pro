{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Just a year ago you [C]promised me we'd [G]marry
That you'd [D7]never do a thing to cause me [G]pain
Now the one you vowed to [C]carry you've [G]forgotten
And these [D7]awful things I fear have caused me [G]shame
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
If there's [C]someone else be big enough to [G]tell me
I'll be [D7]big enough to wish the best for [G]you
I should be the first to [C]know if you don't [G]love me
Is it [D7]asking too much just to know the [G]truth
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Is there any truth in [C]what I hear [G]about you
Is it [D7]true that you want someone more than [G]me
Just say it isn't [C]so and I won't [G]doubt you
You're the [D7]one I love the one that I [G]believe
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
If there's [C]someone else be big enough to [G]tell me
I'll be [D7]big enough to wish the best for [G]you
I should be the first to [C]know if you don't [G]love me
Is it [D7]asking too much just to know the [G]truth
