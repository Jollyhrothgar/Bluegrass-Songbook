{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]She wakes me every [Em]morning with a touch of her hand
[G]A soft voice says good morning [C]dear
[D7]Lips like red roses whisper my name as I thrill to her presence so [G]near
Eyes bright as diamonds a [Em]purplish [G]gleam a luster that grows from her [C]cheeks
My [D7]tears almost show but she must never know that I know she cheats on [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I stand in the [Em]doorway she smiles up at me and [G]says darling have a good [C]day
A [D7]sweet kind of sadness swells up in my heart 
As I look down on her angel [G]face
She's hiding a [Em]secret that I help her keep to [G]lose her I couldn't con[C]ceive
So [D7]I just let it go so she will never know that I know she cheats on [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I come home in the [Em]evening she meets me at the door 
Her [G]smile melts my anger [C]away
A [D7]warm cup of coffee my slippers by the chair 
It's the end of another long [G]day
I can't fight the [Em]feeling that I have for her such [G]beauty to lie and [C]deceive
I [D7]can't let her go so she must never know that I know she cheats on [G]me
{end_of_verse}
