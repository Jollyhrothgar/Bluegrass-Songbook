{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I put my little girl to bed with [D7]teardrops in her eyes
All day I've tried to comfort her and [C]louder were her [G]cries
I left her there to say her prayers and [G7]stepped outside the [C]door
The [D7]prayer I heard was one I knew I'd never heard [G]before
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Please have my mommy ask my [D7]daddy to come home
Sometimes I cry and get my way and [C]mommy's so [G]alone
She told me once that [G7]when I'm right I [C]never should give [G]in
So [D7]if at first I don't succeed I'll cry and cry [G]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I know our little girl is right and [D7]we're both in the wrong
And so I've called you up tonight to [C]ask you please come [G]home
I can't go on or stand for long [G7]the way she cries [C]today
And [D7]I can't go to sleep tonight because I heard her [G]pray
