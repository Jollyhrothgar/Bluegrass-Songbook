{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]We should be happy [F]just the way we [C]are
We got a brand new house with a [F]circle [C]drive and a fancy [G7]car
But furs and [C]diamonds [F]and a Cadil[C]lac  
Don’t mean a thing [F]when you’re [C]sleeping [G7]back to [C]back
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You look at [F]your wall I stare at [C]mine
But we never really [F]seem to [C]say what’s on our [G7]mind
We don’t talk things [C]over [F]we ignore the [C]facts
That our love can’t live [F]when it’s [C]sleeping [G7]back to [C]back
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
When I fell in love with you  [F]you didn’t have a [C]dime
But we spent our nights [F]making [C]love not marking [G7]time
And I’d trade this [C]mansion [F]for a run down [C]shack
And a man who don’t [F]believe in [C]sleeping [G7]back to [C]back
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You look at [F]your wall I stare at [C]mine
But we never really [F]seem to [C]say what’s on our [G7]mind
We don’t talk things [C]over [F]we ignore the [C]facts
That our love can’t live [F]when it’s [C]sleeping [G7]back to [C]back
