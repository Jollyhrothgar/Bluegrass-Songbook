[G]Tonight I hear Hawaiian [D7]echoes calling [G]me
Back to that [D7]isle of dreams by the silvery [G]sea
Where someone's [D7]waiting softly [G]praying
Oh south wind [D7]hear my plea send my love to [G]me

And I know that some[C]day I'll [G]go back where
Blue [D7]waves take me back to the [G]shore
Hand in hand neath the [C]palms we'll [G]stroll in the sand
Just [D7]as we did long [G]ago
