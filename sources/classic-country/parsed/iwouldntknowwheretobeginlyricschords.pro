You've fallen [C]for and [G]I know it
You don't love me any[C]more 
And you [G]show it

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You're [C]saying things 
Like here's where I came [G]in

Forget it all and start anew
But I wouldn't know [D7]where to [G]begin
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I stopped [C]looking for [D7]love 
The day [G]I met you
Friends told me [C]what you wouldn't [D7]do 
And yet [G]I'd let you
