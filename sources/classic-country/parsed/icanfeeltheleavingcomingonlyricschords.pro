{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I didn’t sleep to good last night 
She kept me up with a reading light
I think she does it cause she knows it [D7]bugs me
Well this coffee’s cold and it’s way too strong
She went and cooked my eggs too long
And I turned away when she walked up to [G]hug me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I can’t stand the way this radiator knocks
And I can’t find a pair of socks 
And Jimmy get your [G7]bike in off the [C]lawn
Looks [D7]like the rain will never end
It feels like the walls are caving in
And I can feel the leaving coming [G]on
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And this [D7]mirror sure could use a little bit of [G]dustin’
There’s [D7]tracks and lines that I ain’t seen 
And the guy in there looks like his soul is slowly rustin’
This [G]crossword puzzle has got my head spinning round
And the kids won’t turn the TV down 
And it’s a dirty shame cost of living keeps a [D7]risin’
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
It must be 3 or 4 below but I see it’s 87 down in Mexico
And here’s a hundred dollar trip to Europe that they’re adver[G]tising
She looks at me with her haunted eyes she recognizes all the signs
The anger then the [G7]silence and then I’m [C]gone
[D7]Lord I tried my best to stay but my mind woke up and in Spain today
And I can feel the leaving coming [G]on
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
And [D7]I can feel the leaving coming [G]on
