The moon hid its light and the [G7]midnight was still

But in anger he turned with no [G7]kiss and no care
There she stood on the cliff with the [F]wind in her [C]hair

Girl climbin' and slipped all the [F]newspapers [C]said

Then [G7]night after night when the moon hides its light
The [F]wind's in the [C]mist

Years have gone by and they [G7]talk of him still
And the voice that was callin' from the [F]top of the [C]hill

How he ran toward the cliff then was [F]heard from no [C]more

Now [G7]night after night when the moon hides its light

To give [F]Jeannie one last [C]kiss
Come give [F]Jeannie one last [C]kiss
{end_of_verse}
