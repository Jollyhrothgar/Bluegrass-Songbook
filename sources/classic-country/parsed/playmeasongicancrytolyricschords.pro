I stood by as the band [C]started [G]playing
[D7]And I didn’t even try [C]to play [G]along

Then a [G]smile slowly came [C]across his [G]teardrops
[D7]And I watched as he [C]slowly bowed his [G]head
Just before he left this [C]world for one much [G]better
I [C]remembered the little [D7]lonely man had [G]said
