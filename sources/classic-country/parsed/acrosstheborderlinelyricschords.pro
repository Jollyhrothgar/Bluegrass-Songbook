{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]There's a place where [G7]I've been [C]told
[F]Every street is [G7]paved with [C]gold
And it's just [Am]across the border [G7]line
[C]And when it's time to [G7]take your [C]turn
Here's a lesson that [F]you must [Dm]learn
[C]You could lose more [G7]than you'll ever [C]find
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
When you [Am]reach the [G7]broken [C]promised land
[F]And every [C]dream slips through your hands
Then you'll know that it's too [Am]late to change your [G7]mind
Cause [F]you've paid the [G7]price to [C]come so far
[F]Just to [G7]wind up [Am]where you are
And you're [C]still [G7]just across the border [C]line
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Up and down the [G7]Rio [C]Grande
[F]A thousand footprints [G7]in the [C]sand
Reveal a secret [Am]no one can de[G7]fine

In between our [F]life and [Dm]death
[C]Who's the next to [G7]cross the border[C]line
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Hope remains [G7]when pride is [C]gone 
And it keeps you [F]moving [Dm]on
[C]Calling you [G7]across the border[C]line
{end_of_verse}
