{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I woke up in a [F]strange place this [C]morning
And [F]it wasn't you [C]lying by my [G7]side
I could [C]tell she knew [F]what I was [C]thinking
Cause a guilty conscious is so hard to [G7]hide
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Then I [C]thought what if I [F]came home this [C]morning
[F]To find them icy [C]fingers holding [G7]you
Then I [C]made up my mind if [F]I make it by this [F][C]time
It's the [C]last time I'll [G7]ever cheat on [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Cause you treated me so [G7]kind
I must have [F]been out of my [C]mind
How can I stand to treat you the way I [G7]do
And if God lets me [C]live 
And you can [F]find you can [F][C]forgive
It's the [C]last time I'll [G7]ever cheat on [C]you
