{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Don't listen to gossip what[G7]ever you do
It's usually lies that you'll [C]hear
What they say about me they [G7]say about you
So kiss me and dry up your [C]tears
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And [F]don't you believe what they [C]say about me
They're [G7]tryin' to keep us a[C]part
The [F]vows that were spoken weren't [C]meant to be broken
Don't [G7]turn me away from your [C]heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
It's cheap and it's worthless so [G7]cold and so cruel
It's gossip that I'm speakin' [C]of
So often it starts on the [G7]lips of a fool
And ends in the ashes of [C]love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
So [F]don't you believe what they [C]say about me
They're [G7]tryin' to keep us a[C]part
The [F]vows that were spoken weren't [C]meant to be broken
Don't [G7]turn me away from your [C]heart
{end_of_verse}
