All my life I've heard the story
About a [F]man from Gali[C]lee
How He calmed the raging river
And He [D7]walked the stormy [G7]sea (walked the stormy sea)
I can [C]feel the winds a-blowing
Here [F]upon my bended [C]knees
So I'm callin' out to you Lord

Shining [D7]through the angry [G7]waves (the angry waves)
