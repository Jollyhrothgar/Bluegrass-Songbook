[C]I could call her up [F]again tonight
[G7]Chances are she’d [C]see me
She’d be ready like [F]she was the other [G7]time

Her [F]body couldn’t [G7]drive my love for [C]you out of my sight

[C]Its been two long years [F]since I came home
And [G7]found your goodbye [C]letter

Still I can’t get over [F]what you left [G7]behind
I [C]tried turning to a [F]woman who was [G7]burning up with [C]passion

But her [F]body couldn’t [G7]keep you off my [C]mind
