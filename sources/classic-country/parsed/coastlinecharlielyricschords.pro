{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]It's hard for me to remember back 
But I [F]think they named me Charlie Black
The [G7]doctor said I'd die but I lived [C]somehow
[G7]Now they've [C]changed my name but not my luck 
The [F]Black is gone but Charlie stuck
[G7]Coastline Charlie is what they call me [C]now [G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I was [C]hatched in Tennessee 
But that [F]didn't mean a thing to me
[G7]Soon as I could walk I aimed it [C]south
[G7]I thumbed my [C]way to New Orleans 
To [F]try my luck with the Cajun queens
And [G7]Coastline Charlie is what they call me [C]now
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Coast[F]line Charlie is my name 
At least [C]that's how they pegged me
And I [F]wouldn't change it back again 
Even [C]if the good Lord [G7]begged me
The [C]only place I can be found 
Is on the [F]courtin' side of a Portland town
And [G7]Coastline Charlie's what they call me [C]now
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Yes you could say I'm the rowdy sort 
I [F]got a pet in every port
And [G7]I'll do anything that time [C]allows
[G7]Up and [C]down the coastal lines 
I've [F]upped and down 'em many a time
And [G7]Coastline Charlie is what they call me [C]now
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[G7]Now when I [C]die please humor me 
And [F]take my body out to sea
And [G7]drop me in as close as law [C]allows
[G7]Cause by and [C]by the tide might bring me in 
To [F]shore for one more fling
And [G7]Coastline Charlie is what they call me [C]now
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Coast[F]line Charlie is my name 
At least [C]that's how they pegged me
And I [F]wouldn't change it back again

The [C]only place I can be found 
Is on the [F]courtin' side of a Portland town
And [G7]Coastline Charlie's what they call me [C]now
{end_of_verse}
