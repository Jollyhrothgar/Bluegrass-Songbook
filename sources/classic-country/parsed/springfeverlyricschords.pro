{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Last night he took me in his arms and [D7]held me tenderly
He said I don't know what's got into you but I'm [G]lovin' what I see
I hid my shame and tried to say the [C]words I longed dreamed of
But [D7]instead of saying set me free I whispered I'm in [G]love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I said I guess it's [C]spring fever in the middle of [G]winter
I hear bird [D7]singin' an' I feel the warm [G]sunshine too
I said I guess it's [C]spring fever in the middle of [G]winter
That makes the warm of [D7]glowing love
But I just couldn't tell him it was [G]someone new
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I tried to make you understand the [D7]reasons I can't go
Your love is fresh and new but his love's true it's [G]had time to grow
And even though he may no longer [C]keep me satisfied
Don't you [D7]know he's still got spring and fall and summer on his [G]side
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I said I guess it's [C]spring fever in the middle of [G]winter
I hear bird [D7]singin' an' I feel the warm [G]sunshine too
I said I guess it's [C]spring fever in the middle of [G]winter
That makes the warm of [D7]glowing love
But I just couldn't tell him it was [G]someone new
