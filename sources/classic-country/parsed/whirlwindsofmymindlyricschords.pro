{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]The tenderness of spring took [F]my hand and walked with [C]me
And [F]bathed me in the [G7]showers of her [C]love
Whatever dream I dared Virginia [F]made me know she [C]cared
With [F]loveliness as [G7]gentle as a [C]dove
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Her tender love can't [F]see the wildness [G7]in the depths of [C]me
And who would dare to [G7]hurt the gentle [C]kind
But no woman can [F]control the burning [G7]wildness in my [C]soul
That [F]roars like the [G7]whirlwinds of my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]Whirlwinds of my mind [G7]that keep [C]turning
With [F]each turning [G7]thought I still [C]find
Passing in review [F]all the things we use to [C]do
Virginia you're a [G7]whirlwind of my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
The early summer sun found [F]me with another [C]one
[F]Burning out the [G7]wildest mount of [C]flame
Judy was the kind that [F]could cool my burning [C]mind
And [F]never feel [G7]reproach upon her [C]name
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
We laughed the summer [F]through doing [G7]what we cared to [C]do
Knowing we would [G7]leave it all [C]behind
And with a change of [F]heart felt the urge [G7]to drift [C]apart
[F]Drifting like the [G7]whirlwinds of my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
[F]Whirlwinds of my mind [G7]that keep [C]turning
With [F]each turning [G7]thought I still [C]find
Passing in review [F]all the laughter that we [C]knew
With nothing but the [G7]whirlwinds of my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
The autumn winds that fell the [F]leaves then chill my wild [C]desires
And [F]tame my heart in [G7]nature's fertile [C]seed
With broken mind and will [F]Charlotte's beauty made me [C]thrill
Then [F]bound my heart [G7]in love so [C]helplessly
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
A tune of [F]moving on seemed to be [G7]her favorite [C]song
Her wandering ways I [G7]just couldn't seem to [C]bind
And with the winter [F]snow she wandered on [G7]and left me [C]cold
With [F]nothing but the [G7]whirlwinds of my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 9}
[F]Whirlwinds that turn [G7]back for the spring and [C]summer
And [F]to an autumn [G7]love I couldn't [C]bind
And as each whirlwind dies much [F]too late I [C]realize
I've nothing but the [G7]whirlwinds of my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}
