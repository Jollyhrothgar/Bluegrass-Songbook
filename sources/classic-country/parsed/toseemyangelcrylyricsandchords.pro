{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]See her there see her crying she [C]thinks she loves him [G]so
She don't [C]know how much it [G]hurts me to hear her beg him not to [D7]go
If she were [G]mine again I'd never let the [C]tears fill her [G]eyes
She don't [C]know how much it [G]hurts me to [D7]see an angel [G]cry
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Once she built her world around me but like a [C]fool I tore it [G]down
And she [C]begged me not to [G]leave her just the way she's doing [D7]now
Now she's [G]begging to another with [C]that same hurt in her [G]eyes
She don't [C]know how much it [G]hurts me to [D7]see an angel [G]cry
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I didn't [C]know how much I loved her till she turned and walked [G]away
I didn't [C]know how much I hurt her till I saw her here this [D7]way
If she were [G]mine I'd hold her forever and dry the [C]tears from her [G]eyes
She don't [C]know how much it [G]hurts me to [D7]see my angel [G]cry
{end_of_verse}
