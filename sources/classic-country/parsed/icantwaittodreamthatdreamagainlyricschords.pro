{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Last night our [F]home seemed so much [C]warmer
And once more you lay sleeping by my [G7]side
[C]You wasn't there when [F]I woke up this [C]morning
I must have [F]dreamed that [G7]dream again last [C]night
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I know now you [F]won't be [C]coming home
But tonight you'll come and lay down next to [G7]me
When [C]the sun comes up [F]I'll turn my head [C]away
And pretend it's [F]still so [G7]dark that I can't [C]see
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And when those evening [F]shadows start [C]falling
And darkness is just around the [G7]bend
When [C]sleep comes to [F]me you'll come [C]calling
And I can't [F]wait to [G7]dream that dream [C]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
And I can't [F]wait to [G7]dream that dream [C]again
{end_of_verse}
