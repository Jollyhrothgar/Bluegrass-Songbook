[C]If I've ever planted flowers in your [Am]garden

With a [F]knock upon your [G7]door

I'm just [F]tak[G7]in' a mental [C]journey
And my [F]thoughts may wander [G7]back from time to [C]time

I'm just [F]walkin' with the [G7]memories of my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
When loneliness surrounds me and my [Am]future is my past
I [F]escape into my [G7]dreams
I [C]carefully choose in memories from the [Am]meadows of my past
That once were [F]green and once [G7]again
{end_of_verse}
