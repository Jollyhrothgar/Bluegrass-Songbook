{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I never had the one that I [F]wanted
Never [G7]wanted the one that I [C]had
For the one that I had was a good [F]girl
And the [G7]one that I wanted was [C]bad
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
They say that the [F]grass always looks [C]greener
And I guess that's the nature of a [G7]man
To let [C]passion have its way
Never thinking what [F]he'll pay
And it's [G7]hard oh ain’t it hard to [C]understand
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
What makes a man [F]want to flirt with [C]danger
Like a child that's playing [G7]with a fire
Must the most [C]luscious peach 
Be always out of [F]reach
And the [G7]things you can't have you [C]desire
{end_of_verse}

I never had the one that I [F]wanted
Never [G7]wanted the one that I [C]had
If I ever get back to the good [F]girl
I'll [G7]never go back to the [C]bad 
{end_of_verse}
