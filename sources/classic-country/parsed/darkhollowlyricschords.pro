{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I'd rather be in [G7]some dark [C]hollow
Where the sun don[F]'t ever [C]shine

Just [F]knowing that she’s gone
That would [C]cause me to [G7]lose my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
So freight train [G7]blow your [C]whistle
Take me far on [F]down the [C]track
I'm going [C7]away I'm [F]leaving today
I'm [C]going but I’m [G7]never coming [C]back
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I'd rather be in [G7]some dark [C]hollow 
Where the sun don[F]'t ever [C]shine
Than to be in [C7]some big [F]city
Get a[C] small room with [G7]her on my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
So freight train [G7]blow your [C]whistle
