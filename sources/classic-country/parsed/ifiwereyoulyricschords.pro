[G]You were standin' at my front door [C]when I came [D7]home to[G]night [C]   [D7]
And I could [G]tell by the look you gave [C]me you were needin' my [D7]advice
[C]You say you want more out of life [D7]than he can give you
As a tear rolls [Em]down your face   [C]
But girl I've [G]seen the way he looks at you
And I [D7]know someone who'd gladly take your [G]place [D7]

If I were [G]you I'd [C]run back home to[G]night
Tell him [C]everything's al[G]right yeah I [D7]know what I'd do

You shouldn't think you're missing out on some[C]thing
Because you [D7]wear a wedding [G]band  [C]   [D7]

Who wants [C]more than just a one night [D7]stand
You know this [C]single life I'm livin' ain't [D7]all it's cracked [Em]up to be[C]
