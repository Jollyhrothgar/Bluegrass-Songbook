{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]We pull a chair up every night and eat and [C]talk and joke and fight
Us [D7]kids learned wrong from right at mama's [G]table
Just some hickory wood and screws it's where my [C]daddy read the news
You didn't [D7]put your dirty shoes on mama's [G]table [C]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
It was the [G]center of the best times I [C]remember
Some[D7]times the only thing that brought us all [G]together
Grandma passed it down when I was in a [C]cradle
It's [D7]in my kitchen now but it's still my mama's [G]table
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
It's where my brother and I played games I just [C]knew he'd gone insane 
The [D7]day he carved his name in mama's [G]table
And when we got down on our luck it seemed [C]like it held us up
You [D7]could always feel the love in mama's [G]table
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
It was the center of the best [C]times I remember
Some[D7]times the only thing that brought us all [G]together
Grandma passed it down when I was in a [C]cradle
It's [D7]in my kitchen now but it's still my mama's [G]table [C]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
It has some [G]faded spots and cracks 
And a [C]couple of burns from candle wax
There’s a [D7]memory in each scratch on mama's [G]table
{end_of_verse}
