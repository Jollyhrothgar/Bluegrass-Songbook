{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Today you wed a new love
And [F]leave behind your blue [C]love
I guess I've known it all [G7]along
I hear the organ [C]playing 
I [F]know you'll soon be [C]saying
The words that would [G7]make you his [C]alone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]Once I shared your love dear 
Your dreams of [C]happiness
What was [D7]in the future my heart just couldn't [G7]guess
That someday you'd find a new [C]love 
And [F]leave behind your blue [C]love
My life was [G7]only meant for [C]misery 
{end_of_verse}
