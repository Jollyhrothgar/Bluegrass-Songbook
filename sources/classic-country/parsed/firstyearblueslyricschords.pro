{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Now I've been married about six months
Only six [C7]months you [F]see
The first three months [G7]was all ok
But the last three is killing [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
My wife began her hissing cut down on her kissing
And then she failed to [C7]shine my [F]shoes
My shirts they came [G7]up wrinkled
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
My pants with dirt were sprinkled
And then I took the first year [C]blues
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Well then she started nagging
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
She left the sink a'sagging
With dishes [C7]piled up [F]high
No food upon the table she [G7]said if she was able
She'd cook something bye and [C]bye
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Then I began to wonder if I had made a blunder
When I said I [C7]do she must have [F]read my [G7]thinking
Her eyes began to blinking and that gal broke [C]into
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Well I heard the dishes crashing
And I began to dashing getting out [C7]of [F]sight
For right there was [G7]my honey
On who I'd spent my money turning into [C]dynamite
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
Then after she'd exploded her meanness all unloaded
And things began to [C7]simmer [F]down
I found myself a'bleeding [G7]and very much a'needing
Of stitches taken all [C]around
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 9}
Well then she started crying I felt myself a'sighing
And then I took her in [C7]my [F]arms
I was afraid to scold her [G7]so I just gently told her
She didn't do a bit of [C]harm
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 10}
Now the first six months is over and I am much the older
And experienced [C7]with a [F]wife
If I can stand the next six my friends [G7]all say I'll be fixed
To take it the rest of my [C]life
{end_of_verse}
