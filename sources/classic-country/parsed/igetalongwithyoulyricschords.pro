[C]I don't get [Dm]along  with [G7]people who aren't [C]kind
I don't get [Dm]along  with [G7]folks with only money on their [C]mind
And I don't [F]get along with someone 
Who's always tryin' to tell me what to [Em]do [Am]
But on and [Dm]on  [G7]I get along with [C]you

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Well I don't [Dm]like  people [G7]always tellin' me that I should [C]change
They get simple [Dm]lives for them to [G7]think 
They've got my life to re[C]arrange
But they [F]don't understand exactly what love boils down [Em]to [Am]
Cause on and [Dm]on  [G7]I get along with [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well [F]all it takes to please me is waking in the morning 
Feeling [C]you by my side
And [F]all I ever needed is knowing that I'm needed in your [G7]life
I may not [Dm]do all the [G7]things that other people want me [C]to
But on and [Dm]on  [G7]I get along with [C]you
Yeah on and [Dm]on  [G7]I'll get along with [C]you
