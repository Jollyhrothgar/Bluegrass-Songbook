{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Some people drink champagne out under the [F]stars
While others drink [G7]wine lean over a [C]bar
But all that I need dear to make me feel [F]fine
Is to know that your [G7]love will forever be [C]mine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I'd give an Ocean of [F]Diamonds the world filled with [C]flowers
Just to hold you [G7]close dear for just a few [C]hours
To hear you whisper softly that you love me [F]too
Would change all the [G7]dark clouds to the bluest of [C]blue
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I don't drink their champagne and I don't drink their [F]wine
So if you [G7]refuse me my poor heart will [C]pine
I'll be so lonely till the day that I [F]die
As long as I [G7]live here you can still hear me [C]cry
{end_of_verse}
