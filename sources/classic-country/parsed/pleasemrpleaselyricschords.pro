[C]In the corner of the bar there stands a jukebox
With the best of country music old and [G7]new

You can hear your five selections for a quarter
And [F]somebody else's songs when yours are [G7]through

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I got good Kentucky whiskey [C]on the counter
And my friends around to help me ease the [F]pain
Till some button-pushing cowboy plays that love [C]song
And [F]here I am just [G7]missing you [C]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Please Mr. please don't play [G7]B-17
It was our song it was his song but it's [C][F]o-ver
Please Mr. please if you know what I [G7]mean
I don't ever wanna hear that song [C]again

Maybe [F]even in the state of [G7]Tennessee

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
But I guess I'd better get myself [C]together
Cause when you left you didn't leave too [F]much behind
Just a note that said I'm sorry by your [C]picture
And a [F]song that's weighing [G7]heavy on my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I got good Kentucky whiskey [C]on the counter
And my friends around to help me ease the [F]pain
Till some button-pushing cowboy plays that love [C]song
And [F]here I am just [G7]missing you [C]again
{end_of_verse}
