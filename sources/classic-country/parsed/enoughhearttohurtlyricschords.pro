[C]You've gone away and [F]left me here to [C]cry

[C]You've treated me like [F]I was only [G7]dirt
And left me just enough heart to [C]hurt

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You've taken all the [F]good times that we [C]had
And left me here with [F]nothing but the [G7]bad
[C]The dreams I have are [F]ones that didn't [G7]work
Now I've got just enough heart to [C]hurt
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]I've got just enough heart to [C]hurt
The [D7]little bit you left me [G7]only makes it worse
[C]How could you ever [F]treat me so un[C]kind
The least you could have [F]done was take my [G7]mind
[C]My mind's just taken [F]me from bad to [G7]worse
Now I've got just enough heart to [C]hurt
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
