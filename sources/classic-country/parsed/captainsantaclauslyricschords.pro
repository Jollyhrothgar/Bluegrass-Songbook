{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]The [G7]word had spread from [C]town to town
That [G7]Santa's sled had [C]broken down
And [D7]there would [G7]be no [C]toys this Christmas day
[G7]When suddenly a [C]cry was heard up [G7]in the sky is [C]that a bird
And [D7]all the children shouted hip hooray (hip [G7]hooray)
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Hoo[C]ray for Captain [F]Santa [C]Claus and his [G7]reindeer space [C]patrol
His sleigh broke down one [F]Christmas [C]Eve as he [D7]started from the [G7]pole
He said those children's [C]heart would break if [G7]I don't make this [C]trip
But [D7]Santa's helpers saved the day when they built a rocket [G7]ship
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Then [C]with his reindeer [F]space ca[C]dets he took [G7]off through the [C]air
And not one chimney [F]did they miss every [D7]stocking got its [G7]share
Now children dance with [C]glee around the [F]tree each time they're told
The [C]tale of Captain Santa Claus and his [G7]reindeer space [C]patrol
