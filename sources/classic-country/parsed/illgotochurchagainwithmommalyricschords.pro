Some[G]day in the sweet by and [D7]by
[G]I'll go to church again with [C]momma 
Up [G]there in the [D7]chapel in the [G]sky

You know when I was [C]just a little boy 
My [G]momma used to take me to church
And we'd [D7]read the Bible together
[G]And we'd sing those wonderful old hymns 
That [C]just seemed to warm your heart all over
[G]Yes I know those were the [D7]happiest days I've ever [G]spent
When I went to church with momma
