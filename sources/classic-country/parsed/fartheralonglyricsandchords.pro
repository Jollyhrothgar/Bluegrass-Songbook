{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Tempted and tried we're [F]oft made to [C]wonder

While there are others [C]living [F]about [C]us 
Never molested [G7]though in the [C]wrong

Farther along we'll [F]know all about [C]it

We'll understand it [G7]all by and [C]by
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Faithful to death is our [F]loving [C]Savior
A few more days [D7]labor and [G7]wait

As we walk through that [G7]beautiful [C]gate
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
When we see Jesus [F]coming in [C]glory 
When he comes from his [D7]home in the [G7]sky
Then we shall meet [C]him in [F]that bright [C]mansion 
We'll understand it [G7]all by and [C]by
{end_of_verse}

We'll understand it [G7]all by and [C]by
{end_of_verse}
