{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G7]You're a sweet little thing and I hate to put you down
When the perking all over what good are the coffee [D7]grounds
[C]Lovin' you's been real fantastic
I've [F]got to make a little change that's drastic
[G7]I'm movin' on to bigger and better things
Forget about what I said about that ring
Cause I ain't built that [C]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G7]I'd rather take a beatin' than to have to make you cry
I got new space to wade and lot of new fish to [D7]fry
[C]Settlin' down gives me a complex
I [F]don't care where I go or who I love next
[G7]Don't waste time on beggin' me to stay
Settlin's a game that I never was made to play
Cause I ain't built that [C]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Ropin's my middle name
[G7]To me all towns are [C]just the same
And when it [D7]comes to lovin' dames
I [G7]remember the face and forget the name
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[D7]Travel light and I [G7]live from day to day
And I never ever let my heart get in my [D7]way
[C]Settlin' down gives me a complex
I [F]don't care where I go or who I love next
[G7]Cause I'm movin' on to bigger and better things
Forget about what I said about that ring
Cause I ain't built that [C]way
{end_of_verse}
