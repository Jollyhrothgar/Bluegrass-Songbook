{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]I find myself [D7]wondering [G]about him now and [Em]then[C]
Like some [D7]dream over[G]due[Dm]   [G]
Some[C]times on the [D7]avenue like we're [G]both with[Em]out a balloon[C] 
Feels like the [D7]roses are still in [G]bloom[D7]

Don't [G]mind me  if sudden [C]tear[D7]drops start to [Em]fall
It's just an [C]old love [D7] and that's [G]all[Am]

Some[Em]times all it [A7]takes is a [Am]mel[C]od[D7]y

Don't mind [G]me if my [C]life is [D7]wondering [Em]too
Is just an [C]old love [D7]something I see in [G]you

[G]Last night I had a [Em]picture out[C] 
To see if his [D7]eyes would still [G]shine[Dm]   [G]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[C]Sure enough and [D7]right away I [G]had to look the [Em]other way[C]
Just couldn't keep my [D7]heart off of my [G]mind[D7]
Don't [G]mind me  if I should [C]stare [D7]across the [G]room
It's just an [C]old love that's [D7]come back way too [Em]soon [G]
Just an [C]old love but [D7]that ain't nothing [G]new
