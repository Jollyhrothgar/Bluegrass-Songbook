Winter needs the [C]north wind and the [G][C][G]sn-ow-flakes

I just need to [C]feel your arms [G]around [G][C]me 
I just need your [C]tender loving [G]care

Day goes by so [C]slow when you're not [G]w-ith [G][C]me

Everything is [C]nothing dear [G]without [G][C]you 
And I'm nothing without your [C]tender loving [G]care
I just need your [C]tender loving [G]care
{end_of_verse}
