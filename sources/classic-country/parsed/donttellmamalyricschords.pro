{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I was headed north on Highway Five 
On a [F]star-lit Sunday night
When a [G7]pickup truck flew by me out of con[C]trol
As I watched in my headlights 
He swerved [F]left then back right
He never [G7]hit the brakes as he left the [C]road
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I found him lying in the grass 
[F]Among the steel and glass
With an [G7]empty whiskey bottle by his [C]side
And through the blood and tears 
He [F]whispered in my ear
A [G7]few last words just before he [C]died
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Don't tell mama I was [F]drinking
Lord [C]knows her soul would never [G7]rest
[C]I can't leave this world with [F]mama thinking
I [G7]met the Lord with whiskey on my [C]breath
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I still think about that night 
And [F]how that young man died
And how [G7]others sometimes pay for our mis[C]takes
The last thing on his mind 
As he [F]left this world behind
Was [G7]knowing someone else's heart would [C]break
{end_of_verse}
