{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]It’s so [G7]hard to say I [C]love you
It’s so [D7]hard for me to tell you how I [G]feel
Although [G7]I’m always dreaming of [C]you
It seems [D7]that my dreams will never turn out [G]real
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I’ve [D7]loved you [C]ever since the day [G]that I first met you
Yes but [A7]I could never ever find a [D7]way
To say that [G7]I’m always thinking of [C]you
And I [D7]love you little darling more each [G]day
Repeat all
{end_of_verse}
