{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Funny how I can [F]go on living
[G7]And lose the simple [F]knack of [C]giving
[F]It slips away [D7]before I know it's [G7]gone
[C]I build a wall and [F]before I know it
[G7]Someone woos me and I [F]wanna [C]show it
I [F]just can't find a way of letting [G7]on
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}

I've been [F]alone too long

{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I wanna [F]build you a dream
[C]Paint you a sunrise
[E7]Write you a beautiful [Am]song
But I [Dm]don't know how
[G7]I've been alone too [C]long
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Funny how I can [F]cut off feeling
[G7]And tell the world my [F]wounds are [C]healing
[F]All I've done is [D7]turn the pain [G7]inside
[C]And when I'm sure no one [F]can get to me
[G7]There's a smile and it [F]goes right [C]through me
To [F]wake up to something that I thought had [G7]died
