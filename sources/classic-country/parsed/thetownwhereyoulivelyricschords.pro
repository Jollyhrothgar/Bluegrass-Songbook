{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Twenty miles of memories till I pass [C7]right by your [F]home
And [G7]I always wonder if you're a little disturb as this big rig roars [C]along 
Cause I know you haven't forgotten when we had so [C7]much love to [F]give 
And [G7]that's why I'd rather die than drive through the town where you [C]live
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I always notice your two Cadillac’s and your [C7]twenty acre [F]lawn 
And [G7]that big house of stone and marble looks so empty and so [C]alone 
And the tears they blur my vision as I picture you [C7]there with [F]him 
And [G7]I'd rather drive a thousand miles around the town where you [C]live
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I [G7]remember when you said that a truck driving man 
Couldn't [C]give you the things you desire 
And your [D7]hands look better with diamonds 
And you'd [G7]rather ride the chauffeur driven car 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]Well I guess that tonight you've got all these things 
But are you missing the [C7]love I can [F]give 
If [G7]you are then darling be waiting when I pass 
Through the town where you [C]live 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
If [G7]you're lonely then darling be waiting when I pass 
Through the town where you [C]live
{end_of_verse}
