[G]Like a shot through the [D7]heart 
Like a [C]knife cold and sharp
The [G]cold winds of loneliness [D7]blow
But they [G]say that [D7]time can [C]heal heart and mind
If [D7]somehow I could let you [G]go [C]

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Maybe [G]I will [C]forget you it's [G]true
You'll never again cross my [D7]mind
The [G]day that my [C]journey is [G]through
And I [D7]drift down the [G]riv[D7]er of [G]time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Since the day we [D7]met and [C]darling even yet
Our [G]love seemed so honest and [D7]true
And my [G]heart broke the [D7]day that [C]I heard you say
That it [D7]felt like a prison to [G]you [C]
