{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]When God dips His pen of love [F]in my [C]heart
And He writes my soul a message He [D7]wants me to [G7]know
His [C]spirit all divine fills this [F]sinful soul of [C]mine 
When God dips His [G7]love in my [C]heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Well I said I wouldn't tell it to a living soul
How He [F]brought salvation and He made me [C]whole
But I found I couldn't hide such love as Jesus [D7]did [G7]impart
Well He [C]made me laugh and He made me cry set my [F]sinful soul on [C]fire
When God dips His [G7]love in my [C]heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Sometimes though the way is [F]dreary dark and [C]cold
And some unburdened sorrow [D7]keeps me from the [G7]goal
I go to [C]God in prayer I can [F]always find Him [C]there 
To whisper sweet [G7]peace to my [C]soul
{end_of_verse}

Well He [C]made me laugh and He made me cry set my [F]sinful soul on [C]fire
When God dips His [G7]love in my [C]heart
