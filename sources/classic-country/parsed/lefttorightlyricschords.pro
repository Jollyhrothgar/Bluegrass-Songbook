{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I'm taking your [D7]ring from my [G]left hand
Since you made it [D7]plain we must [G]part[G7]
But [C]I'm placing it on my [G]right hand
To show that I [D7]once possessed your [G]heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
From left to right I'll make the [D7]change
Though the [C]diamond still [D7]shines just as bright
As the [G]day when you gave it and [C]my love's as strong
Though I'm [G]changing from [D7]left to [G]right
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I'll wear it my [D7]darling for[G]ever
Though you’ve done me [D7]wrong I'm not [G]ashamed [G7]
When [C]asked who's the giver the [G]tears will fall
But I'll proudly [D7]tell them your [G]name
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
From left to right means good[D7]bye
[C]Oh what a [D7]small ring can do
So I'll [G]take it from my left hand and [C]place it on my right
To [G]show that I [D7]still love [G]you
{end_of_verse}
