{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]When I lost your love dear I [G]lost my everything
The [D7]sunshine from my life has disa[G]ppeared
The [C]night we said our last goodbye I [G]wished you happiness
Then I [D7]walked away so darkness would hide my [G]tears
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
With[C]out the faith of a loved one 
This [G]world's a lonesome place
True [D7]love is mighty cheap at any [G]cost
I'm [C]doomed to be a failure though the 
[G]Future brings wealth and fame
For the [D7]only one I ever loved I [G]lost
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
If [C]I found fame and fortune what [G]good would it do me
I [D7]couldn't fool my heart it knows me [G]best
There's [C]one love in every lifetime [G]mine belongs to you
And [D7]that means more to me than all the [G]rest
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
With[C]out the faith of a loved one 
This [G]world's a lonesome place
True [D7]love is mighty cheap at any [G]cost
I'm [C]doomed to be a failure though the 
[G]Future brings wealth and fame
For the [D7]only one I ever loved I [G]lost
{end_of_verse}
