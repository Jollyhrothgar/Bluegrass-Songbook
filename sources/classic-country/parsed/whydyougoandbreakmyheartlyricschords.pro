[C]Seems you came along at the [F]right time
And fallin' in love was all my [G7]idea

And because of you my heart is broken in [G7]two
I'm feelin' like a fool I'm puttin' my trust in [C]you
You left me wonderin' why you didn't even say good[G7]bye
Well excuse me if I'm not that smart
Why'd you go and break my [C]heart
