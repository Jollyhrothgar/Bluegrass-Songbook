Summer Wages
Recorded J.D. Crowe
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G]Never hit seventeen when you [C]play against the dealer
For you [G]know that the [Am]odds won't ride with [D7]you
And [G]never leave your woman alone
When your [C]friends are out to steal her
Here's a [G]gamble and [Am]lost like summer [D7]wa-[G]ges
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And we'll keep rollin' on till we [C]get to Vancouver
And the [G]woman that I [Am]love is living [D7]there
Its been [G]six long months and [C]more since I've seen her
She may be [G]gambled and [Am]gone like summer [D7]wa-[G]ges
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
And [D7]all the beer taverns all [C]down along [G]Young Street  
The dreams of the [G7]season are all [C]spilled down on the [G]floor
All the [D7]big stands of timber just [C]waitin' for [G]fallin'
And the hustlers sit and [G7]watchfully as they [C]wait there by the [D7]door
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[G]So I'll work on them towboats in [C]my slippery city shoes
Which I [G]swore I would [Am]never do a[D7]gain
Through the [G]gray fog bound straights
Where the [C]cedars stand watchin'
I'll be far [G]off and [Am]gone like summer [D7]wa-[G]ges
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
She's a woman so fine I may [C]never try to find her
For good [G]memories are [Am]what we had [D7]before
They [G]should never be changed 
For they're [C]all that I'll take with me
Now I've [G]gambled and [Am]lost my summer [D7]wa-[G]ges
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
[C]Years are [G]gambled and [Am]lost like summer [D7]wa-[G]ges
{end_of_verse}
