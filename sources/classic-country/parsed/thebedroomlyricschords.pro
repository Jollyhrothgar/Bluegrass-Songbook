{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Two soft pillows and tangled sheets
An unmade [F]bed where no one [C]sleeps
Standing here just [G7]looking at the [C]bedroom
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Laughter was the only sound
As I slipped [F]off my wedding [C]gown
Happiness was glowing in this [G7]room
Pink champagne and candle [C]light 
Love was [F]special on that [C]night
These were our first [G7]memories of the [C]bedroom
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Holidays would always see
The gentle way [F]that you’d wake [C]me
Sometimes we’d talk to nearly [G7]noon
Everything we ever [C]did 
Like making [F]plans and loving [C]kids 
Seems they all [G7]began here in the [C]bedroom
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Then came those nights and quarreling [F]days 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
It all starts at night again
Love hasn’t left this lonely [G7]bedroom 
We ran out of words [F]to say
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Except the nights we’d turn away
And lie awake and cry here in the [G7]bedroom
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
[C]With these papers in our hands
We look [F]back where love [C]began
And wonder did we close the door to [G7]soon
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
[C]At two soft pillows and tangled sheets
An unmade [F]bed where no one [C]sleeps
As we take one last look [G7]at the [C]bedroom
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 9}
Two soft pillows and tangled sheets
An unmade [F]bed where no one [C]sleeps
Standing here just [G7]looking at the [C]bedroom
{end_of_verse}
