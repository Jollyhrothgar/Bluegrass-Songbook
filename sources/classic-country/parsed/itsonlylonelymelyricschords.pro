[C]If you hear some footsteps [F]walking close [C]behind you in the night
And you [G7]look around and no one do you [C]see
If you feel someone is [F]watching you [C]and there's no one in sight
Have no fear it's [G7]only lonely [C]me

It's only lonely me I [C7]want you back [F]again
So I'll [G7]send my memory to haunt you now and [C]then
It follows you around wher[C7]ever you may [F]be
The [G7]ghost of love that's gone it's only lonely [C]me
{end_of_verse}

If sometimes you have the [F]feeling there is [C]something you forgot
Though you [G7]try you can't remember what it [C]was

It was me that [G7]you forgot to [C]love
