{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]This world can take you by the hand and tempt the [F]soul of any man
But you can [C]choose your path there's two roads you can [G7]take
One way is [C]right and one is wrong the flesh is [F]weak but love is strong
And she's [C]all I see be[G7]tween the devil and [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The gates of hell swing open wide invitin' [F]me to step inside
I'll be your [C]friend he calls again I know it's [G7]him
The flames are [C]spreadin' everywhere 
But through the [F]smoke I see her there
She's [C]all I see be[G7]tween the devil and [C]me
{end_of_verse}

I hold her in my arms tonight so safe and [F]warm I close my eyes
And a [C]cool breeze blows cross our bodies in the [G7]dark
Outside her [C]reach is my concern somewhere I [F]know a fire burns
And she's [C]all I see be[G7]tween the devil and [C]me
