{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I just received your last letter and I feel so [G7]blue
[C]I'm paying dearly for promises broken so free
[C7]I never dreamed that there'd be such a longing for [F]you
[G7]But I've been no angel so I've got what's coming to [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G7]I am so weary and tired of another's caress
[C]Though I would love to be with you I know it's too late
[C7]But I still love you and that is one thing I'll [F]confess
[G7]I know I deserve to be punished whatever my [C]fate
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G7]I'd give all these diamonds if I could be happy again
[C]And have you hold me and tell me that we'd never part
[C7]Diamonds can never replace a true sweetheart or [F]friend
[G7]All of this glamor can't banish the ache in my [C]heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[G7]All I have left is a dream of the days that are gone
[C]All I have left is a memory that never will fade
[C7]If you must leave me to suffer life's heartaches [F]alone
[G7]I ask your forgiveness for all the mistakes I have [C]made
{end_of_verse}
