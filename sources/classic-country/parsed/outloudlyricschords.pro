I [C]told him all these [G7]things in my [C]mind

Then out [F]loud I told him I [C]loved him
And [F]what I'd do if only he would [G7]stay

Out [F]loud I [G7]told him just that [C]way
{end_of_verse}

I told him I never thought about him
Even in his arms he never crossed my [G7]mind

Oh I [C]told him all these [G7]things in my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}
