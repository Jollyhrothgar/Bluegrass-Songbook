{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I know you think I’m crazy to take her back [C]again
Just [D7]when she’s fresh from her little world of [G]sin
But you don’t know my sorrow and you don’t face [C]tomorrow
She might be bad but she’s all I [G]had 
And I’m [D7]glad to have her back [G]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I’m glad to [D7]kiss those lips that I’ve miss for so [G]long
I’m glad to take back the [D7]heart
For my part for a [A7]dance and a [D7]song  
[G]Don’t tell me she can’t change for I know she [C]can
She might be bad but she’s all I [G]had 
And I’m [D7]glad to have her back [G]again
