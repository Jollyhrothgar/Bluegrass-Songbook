{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I can [G7]hear her footsteps walkin' by my [Am]bedside Lord she's leavin'
I can [F]smell the perfume [G7]driftin' through my [C]room
If I [G7]try to make her stay I'd know she [Am]couldn't even hear me[C]
Might as [D7]well be on the dark side of the [G7]moon

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Cause it's [F]freezin' in El [G7]Paso in the [C]summer
All the [D7]sweet things here are dyin' on the [G7]vine
Wish that [F]woman could have [G7]took it when the [C]hard times came [Am]around[C]
Wish her [F]winter hadn't [G7]spoil my summer[C]time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
So when her [G7]plane takes off for Memphis I'll be [Am]sittin' in some tavern
I'll be [F]washin' out the [G7]corners of my [C]mind
When she's [G7]in the wild blue yonder I'll be [Am]feedin' that old jukebox [C]
Playin' [D7]every happy song that I can [G7]find
{end_of_verse}

Wish her [F]winter hadn't [G7]spoil my summer[C]time
