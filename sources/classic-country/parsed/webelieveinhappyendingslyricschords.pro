{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Who can tell just how it [G7]starts
[C]Angry words and broken [F]hearts
[C]Till silently we sit [F]apart
  [G7]You and [C]I
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But in awhile the anger's [G7]gone
[C]And we forget who's right or [F]wrong
[C]Then one of us will end it [F]all
  [G7]With just a [C]smile
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
We believe in happy [G7]endings
[C]Never breaking only [F]bending
[C]Taking time enough for [F]mending
  [G7]The hurt [C]inside
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
We believe in new [G7]beginnings
[C]Giving in and [F]forgiving
[C]We believe in happy [F]endings
  [G7]You and [C]I
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Just a word is all it [G7]takes
[C]And so at last the silence [F]breaks
[C]And looking back it makes us [F]ache
  [G7]For what we've [C]done
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
And so we cling together [G7]now
[C]And wonder why we're oh so [F]proud
[C]And all that matters [F]anyhow
  [G7]Is our [C]love
{end_of_verse}
