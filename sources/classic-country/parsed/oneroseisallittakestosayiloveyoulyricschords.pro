[C]Everybody said that Johnny was awfully [G]reckless
And they all said that his speed was gonna be his death some[D7]day

About two young [C]kids who are the victims of a poor neighborhood

[G]Now Becky didn’t have any money to buy Johnny [D7]flowers

But there just [G]weren’t any flowers in bloom

She’s sell that [D7]small locket that he gave her
Surely that would buy one [G]rose
