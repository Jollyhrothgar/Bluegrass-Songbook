{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]You love to put me down each time you're out with your [D7]girlfriends
They ask you if I treat you bad you say that all [G]depends
Well don't you know they realize [G7]you've been slippin' [C]round
[D7]They know how you carry on when I go out of [G]town
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You've got no room to criticize with words you know will [D7]hurt
I'm still countin' lipstick stains on your dirty [G]shirt
People pass me on the street and [G7]shake their heads in [C]pity
[D7]While I wait at home you've got a girl in ever [G]city
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Yes I'll admit it what you say is [D7]true
But I only run around because you do it [G]too
If we could have what we once had [G7]how happy we could [C]be
I [G]won't cheat again on you [D7]if you won't cheat on [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
You'll never know how many nights I've stayed awake and [D7]cried
Ashamed of what I did to you and feelin' sick [G]inside
Now I can walk away from him [G7]without a backward [C]glance
I'm [D7]grateful that you're big enough to give me a second [G]chance
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Now many nights in many towns I've wrestled with the [D7]blues
I never found the nighttime girl who could fill your [G]shoes
How I wish I'd swallowed pride [G7]and come to you [C]before
You'll [D7]never find another man who could love you [G]more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Yes I'll admit it what you say is [D7]true
But I only run around because you do it [G]too
If we could have what we once had [G7]how happy we could [C]be
I [G]won't cheat again on you [D7]if you won't cheat on [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
I won't cheat again on you [D7]if you won't cheat on [G]me
{end_of_verse}
