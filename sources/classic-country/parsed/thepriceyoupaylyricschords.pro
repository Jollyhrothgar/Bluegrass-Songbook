{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]You make up your mind  you choose the chance you [F]take
You ride to where the highway [C]ends and the desert [G7]breaks
Out on to an open [C]road you ride until the [F]day
You learn to sleep [C]at night with the [G7]price you [C]pay
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Now with their hands held high they reached out for the open [F]skies
And then with their last breath they built the [C]roads
They would ride to their [G7]deaths
Driving on [C]through the night unable to break [F]away
From the [C]restless pull of the [G7]price you [F]pay
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Oh the price [C]you pay oh the price you [F]pay
Now you can't [C]walk away [G7]from the price you [C]pay
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Now they'd come so far and they'd waited so [F]long
Just to end up caught in a dream [C]where everything goes [G7]wrong      
Where the dark [C]of night holds back the light of the [F]day
And you've gotta stand [C]and fight for the [G7]price you [F]pay
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Oh the price [C]you pay oh the price you [F]pay
Now you can't [C]walk away [G7]from the price you [C]pay
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[C]Little girl down on the strand
With that pretty little baby in your [F]hands
Do you [C]remember the story of the promised [G7]land
How he crossed the desert [C]sands
And could not enter the chosen [F]land
On the banks of the river he [C]stayed
[G7]To face the price you [C]pay
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
[C]So let the games start you better run you little wild [F]heart
You can [C]run through all the nights and all the [G7]days
But just across the county [C]line
A stranger passing through put up a [F]sign
That counts so many fallen [C]away to the price [G7]you [F]pay 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Oh the [C]price you pay oh the price you [F]pay
Now you can't walk [C]away from the [G7]price you [F]pay
Oh the [C]price you pay oh the price you [F]pay
Now you can't [C]walk away [G7]from the [F]price you [C]pay
{end_of_verse}
