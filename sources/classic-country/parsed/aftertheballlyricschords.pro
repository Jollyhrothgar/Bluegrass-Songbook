{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I hear people laughin' on the corner by the square
The neon flickers on my wall and I know you're out there
I'm [F]in your bed and listenin' for your footsteps down the [C]hall
And I'll be waitin' for you [G7]after the [C]ball
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
After the ball is over after the ball
If you cannot stand I've got a place for you to fall
The [F]blinds are drawn and I have turned the clock face to the wall
I'll be [C]waitin' for you [G7]after the [C]ball
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Lovin' you is sweet addiction I need only you
Just as long as you come back go do what you want to
[F]Give the night your laughter but I'll have you after [C]all
I'll be waitin' for you [G7]after the [C]ball
{end_of_verse}
