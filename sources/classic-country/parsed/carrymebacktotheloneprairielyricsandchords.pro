[C]I'm a roving [Dm]cowboy  [G7]far away from [C]home
Far from the [Dm]prairie  [G7]where I used to [C]roam
Where the doggies [Am]wander and the wind blows [Dm]free
Though my heart is yonder  [G7]on the lone prai[C]rie [F]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]Oh carry me back to the lone prairie
Where the coyotes howl and the wind blows [G7]free
And when I [Dm]die  [G7]you can bury [C]me
Neath the western [Dm]skies [G7]on the lone prai[C]rie
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Give me back my [Dm]saddle [G7]give me back my [C]gun    
Give me back my [Dm]bronco [G7]that I used to [C]run  
Let me spread my [Am]blanket by a peaceful [Dm]stream   
Hear the cowboys singing [G7]in the campfire [C]gleam
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Oh carry me back to the lone prairie
Where the coyotes howl and the wind blows [G7]free
And when I [Dm]die  [G7]you can bury [C]me
Neath the western [Dm]skies [G7]on the lone prai[C]rie
On the [F]lone [G7]prai[C]rie
{end_of_verse}
