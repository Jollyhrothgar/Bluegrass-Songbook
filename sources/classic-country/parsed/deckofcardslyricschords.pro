[C]called Cassino. The [F]next day being Sunday, several [C]of

{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
the text was taken up.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}

{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
them out. The Sergeant who commanded the boys saw the cards and said,
[G7]"Soldier put away those cards."  After the service was over, the

[C]man here?" "For playing cards in church, Sir."  "And [F]what
[C]have you got to [G7]say for yourself, son?"  [C]"Much, [G7]Sir."
[E7]Replied the soldier.  The Marshall said, "I hope so, for
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
if not I shall punish you more than any man was ever punished."
[Am]The soldier said, "Sir, I've been on the march for about
[D7]six days, I had neither Bible nor prayer book, but I hope to
[G7]satisfy you, Sir, with the purity of my [C]intentions."

two parts; The Old and the New Testaments

who preached the Gospel. There was Matthew, Mark, Luke and John

virgins who trimmed their lamps. There were ten of them, five

persons God saved when He destroyed this earth. There was
Noah, his wife, their three sons and their wives

cleansed. And nine out of the ten didn't even thank Him

handed down to Moses on a table of stone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 17}
When I see the "KING", it reminds me that there is but one
King of Heaven, God Almighty
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 18}
And when I see the "QUEEN" I think of the Blessed Virgin Mary
who is Queen of Heaven
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 19}
And the "JACK" or "KNAVE" is the Devil
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 20}

I find 365, the number of days in a year
There;s 52 cards, the number of weeks in a year
There's 4 suits, the number of weeks in a month
There's 12 picture cards, the number of months in a year
