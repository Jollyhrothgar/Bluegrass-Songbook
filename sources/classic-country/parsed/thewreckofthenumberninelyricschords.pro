{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]One dark stormy night not a [C]star was in sight
The [G]north wind came howlin' down the [D7]line
There stood a [G]brave engineer with his [C]sweetheart so dear
And his [G]orders to [D7]pull old Number [G]Nine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
She [D7]kissed him goodbye with a [G]tear in her eye
But the [C]joy in his [G]heart he couldn't [D7]hide
The [G]whole world seemed bright for she [C]told him that night
That [G]tomorrow she'd [D7]be his blushing [G]bride
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The wheels hummed a song as the [C]train rolled along
The [G]black smoke came pouring from the [D7]stack
The [G]headlight agleam seemed to [C]brighten his dream
Of [G]tomorrow when [D7]he'd be going [G]back
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
He [D7]sped around the hill and his [G]brave heart stood still
[C]Headlight was [G]shinin' in his [D7]face
He [G]whispered a prayer as he [C]threw on the air
For he [G]knew this would [D7]be his final [G]race
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
In the wreck he was found lyin' [C]there on the ground
He [G]asked them to raise his weary [D7]head
His [G]breath slowly went as this [C]message he sent
To the [G]maiden who [D7]thought she would be [G]wed
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
There's a [D7]little white home that I [G]built for our own
Where I [C]dreamed we'd be [G]happy you and [D7]I
But I [G]leave it to you for I [C]know you'll be true
Till we [G]meet at the [D7]golden gate good[G]bye
{end_of_verse}
