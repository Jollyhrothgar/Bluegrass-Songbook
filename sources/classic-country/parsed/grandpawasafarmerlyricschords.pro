{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Grandpa was a farmer when I was a kid
He never made no money but he [G7]loved what he did
He'd [C]get up in the morning and go milk the cow
Get out his old team of mules and [G7]go to the fields and [C]plow
He took us to church on Sunday he taught us how to pray
And I remember the [G7]things he used to [C]say
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
He'd say [F]young'uns don't forget where you [C]came from 
And don't forget how God's been good to [G7]you
Be [F]proud to be raised in the [C]country
Stand [D7]up for the old red white and [G7]blue
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
It won't [C]hurt to get a little [G7]dirt on your [C]britches 
When [C7]you go out into the woods and [F]pray
Young'uns don't forget where you [C]came from
Where I'm going and when you [G7]meet me there [C]someday
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I walked the fields he planted the day he passed away
I thought of how we'd meet again [G7]on one glorious day
But [C]until then I'll keep working tending to his fields
Hoping I can do things the [G7]way my grandpa [C]did
