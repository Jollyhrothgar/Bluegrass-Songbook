{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G]Just couldn’t place that [D7]sweet little [G]face
Like words to some old love [C]song
But I whispered a name I thought I’d [G]forgotten
That [D7]my foolish heart [G]belonged 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
A [C]subconscious mind plays tricks [G]sometimes
Like a [D7]little voice whispering [G]within
And dreams have a way of bringing back [C]yesterday
And [A7]my foolish heart ever [D7]win
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[G]Seems so very strange [D7]how old [G]memories
Can come back and knock on your [C]door
Before last night I thought I had [G]forgotten
But [D7]today I’m not so [G]sure
{end_of_verse}
