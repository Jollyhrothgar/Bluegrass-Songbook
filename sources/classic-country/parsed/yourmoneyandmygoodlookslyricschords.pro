{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G7]He's not what you'd call the social type
Though he [C]goes for a drink most every night
I [G]do my time from nine to five
It's a [C]life I guess cause I'm still alive
But [F]lately his routine has changed
The [C]bottom line's been rearranged
[G]All because I said I'd pay
When she whispered in my ear this [G7]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
With [F]your money we could take a trip
We could [C]fly to the moon on a rocket ship
Go [G7]first class on a jet airplane
Or [C]buy a railroad and go by train
With [F]your money she said with a smile
I [C]think I might just stay while
[G7]Write a chapter for the history books
With [C]your money and [G7]my good [C]looks
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G7]I knew something wasn't right
When I [C]couldn't go to sleep at night
Now his [G7]heart's gone and I'll just say
So this [C]house the dog and the Chevrolet
When it [F]comes to looks here's a lesson to learn
The [C]better the look the bigger the burn
Take [G]my advice or walk away
But always be the first to [G7]say
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
With your [F]money we could take a trip
We could [C]fly to the moon on a rocket ship
Go [G7]first class on a jet airplane
Or [C]buy a railroad and go by train
With your [F]money we'll be gone a while
We could [C]sell our love a year in style
[G7]Write a chapter for the history books
With [C]your money and [G7]my good [C]looks
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[G7]Chalk one up for the history books
With [C]your money and [G7]my good [C]looks
{end_of_verse}
