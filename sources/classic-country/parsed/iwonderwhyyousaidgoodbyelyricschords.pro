{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Your letter came this very [F]day 
And it wiped [C]all my dreams [G7]away
I've read it [C]o'er a thousand [F]times 
It's left me [C]with  [G7]a worried [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I wonder why you said [F]goodbye 
And did you [C]mean to make me [G7]cry
I guess [C]until the day I [F]die 
That I will [C]still  [G7]be wondering [C]why
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I hope and pray before my [F]time 
That you'll come [C]back and say you're [G7]mine
Bring back the [C]love you took [F]away 
And mend the [C]heart  [G7]you broke [C]today
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I wonder why you said [F]goodbye 
And did you [C]mean to make me [G7]cry
I guess [C]until the day I [F]die 
That I will [C]still  [G7]be wondering [C]why
{end_of_verse}
