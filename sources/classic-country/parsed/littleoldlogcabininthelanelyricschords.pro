{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I'm getting old and feeble and I [C]cannot find my [G]way

While the [G]years will swiftly pass the time and [C]turn my hair to [G]gray 
In my little old log [D7]cabin in the [G]lane
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh the [C]chimney's falling down and the [G]roof is all caved in
Letting in the sunshine and the [D7]rain
And the [G]only friend I have now is that [C]good old dog of [G]mine
And my little old log [D7]cabin in the [G]lane
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I was once so free and happy and I [C]never knew a [G]care
My wife and little children by my [D7]side
Our [G]little home was humble and the [C]happiness was [G]there
Was the dearest place in [D7]all the world so [G]wide
{end_of_verse}

Oh the [C]chimney's falling down and the [G]roof is all caved in

And my little old log [D7]cabin in the [G]lane

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Till I take my final journey I will [C]try to do my [G]best
Though sad and heavy hearted all the [D7]day 
I’m [G]waiting for the summons to a [C]happy land of [G]rest
And a mansion in a [D7]valley far [G]away  
{end_of_verse}
