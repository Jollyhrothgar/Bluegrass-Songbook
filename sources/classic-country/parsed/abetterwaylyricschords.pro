[G]We spent the night in a [C]hobo town like a [G]pair of run[C]aways
We [G]lit a fire and [C]sang the songs we [D7]learned from yesterday
[G]Settled down and [C]built a house with [G]our own sweatin' [C]hands
What [G]happened next I'll [C]never know or [D7]never understand
[G]Finished with my [C]working day and [G]headed straight for [C]home
I [G]looked inside the [C]bedroom door and [D7]you were not [G]alone

Well I hope you find a [C]better way to [G]get through my front [C]door
The [G]roads you take don't [C]let you see I don't [D7]love you anymore
And [G]if you find a [C]broken heart some[G]where along the [C]way
[G]Don't you dare [C]pick it up it'll [D7]mend itself some[G]day
