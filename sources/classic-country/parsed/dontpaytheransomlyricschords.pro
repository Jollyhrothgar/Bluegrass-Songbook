{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Last night I stopped off for a beer [C]on my way home
And I [G]saw this broken hearted sweet thing [A7]crying all [D7]alone
My [G]tender heart was deeply touched at the [C]sight of a woman's tears
So I said [G]hi there and I pulled up a chair 
And [D7]ordered us a couple of [G]beers
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
We [C]must have drunk a gallon of brew 
When I [G]looked at my watch it was half past two
And [A7]I suddenly realized I hadn't even called my [D7]wife
[G]And knowing what would happen to me when I get home
I nearly [C]broke my neck getting to the phone
And [G]here's what I told her in an [D7]effort to save my [G]life
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Don't pay the ransom honey I've [C]escaped
[D7]Considering what I've been through I'm in good [G]shape
Well my wrist and ankles are a little sore from the [C]tape
But [G]don't pay the ransom [D7]honey I've es[G]caped
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Now if you got tied up somewhere tonight [C]on your way home
In a [G]poker game or with a good looking dame 
And it [A7]slips your mind to [D7]phone
Don't [G]blow your cool like a crazy fool 
And tell your [C]woman where you've been
Your [G]situation requires imagination 
And I've [D7]got a suggestion my [G]friend    tell her...
