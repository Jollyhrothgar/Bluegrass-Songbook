{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I can feel the need and know it won't be [F]long
Until [C]I give into rising weakness and [G7]I pick up the phone
I always [C]head in her direction when there's [F]no place else to turn
And [C]tonight I'll take a walk  [G7]across the bridge I didn't [C]burn
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]Tonight I'll take a walk across the [C]bridge I didn't burn
[F]Pickup where we left off on a [C]lesson still un[G7]learned
It's [C]like I never had a choice where [F]loving her is concerned
So [C]tonight I'll take a walk  [G7]across the bridge I didn't [C]burn
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I should have struck the match a long long time [F]ago
But [C]courage takes a backseat when [G7]old feelings take control
Lord she [C]plays me like a fool every [F]time that I return
But [C]tonight I'll take a walk  [G7]across the bridge I didn't [C]burn
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[F]Tonight I'll take a walk across the [C]bridge I didn't burn
[F]Pickup where we left off on a [C]lesson still un[G7]learned
It's [C]like I never had a choice where [F]loving her is concerned
So [C]tonight I'll take a walk  [G7]across the bridge I didn't [C]burn
{end_of_verse}
