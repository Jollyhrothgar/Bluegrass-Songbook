[G]We could walk away now call it [C]over and done
Say we [Am]fought the good fight and [G]nobody won

[Dm]So we didn't [G]last hey we're [F]not the first
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But [C]then [G]again if we [Am]give it one more [G]try
We [C]might find the [G]feeling can never really [D7]die
And there's [C]still a chance to [D7]be all we might have [Em]been
And [C]find the love we [D7]had back then [G]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Off to such a good start but [C]somehow it seems
We've let our [Am]hearts fall [G]apart at the dreams
We could [C]throw in the towel [Am]walk away with our pride
[Dm]Say it just wasn't [G]worth all the [F]tears that we've cried

[A#7]Maybe if we [Am]want it bad [G]enough
[A#7]We can make it [Am]better than it [D7]ever was

Let's [C]find the love we [D7]had back then [G]again
