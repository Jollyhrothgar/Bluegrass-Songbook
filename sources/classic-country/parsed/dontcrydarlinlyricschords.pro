[C]Drunk totally [Em]drained
On the [C]verge of going crazy [F]on the edge of insane

But don't you [F]cry darlin' [C]though it's a cryin' shame
I [G7]was hooked on that whisky so bad [C]I didn't know my [C7]name when I died
But don't [F]cry darlin' [C]well it's not you're [Am]fault
I was [C]stealin' [F]time from the devil and [G7]I just got [C]caught

You know hon David left you so [Em]long ago
He didn't want to darlin' [C]aw but his dying words told you [F]so

But [C]hell any man can be a fool [A7]
And I [D7]know that he was so ashamed and sorry
For all those [G7]bad things that he did to you
