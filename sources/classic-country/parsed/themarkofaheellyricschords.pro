She was mine for ten long years  [F]that's about ten thousand beers 
[C]Not counting all the nights she was [G7]alone 
Now [C]divide the times she cried  [F]by the times that I have lied

Funny thing now that she's gone  [F]I'm home every night alone

I [C]never thought a broken [G7]heart could be so [C]real

When the book of time is read  [F]and all the words have all been said

Is [C]plain enough for [G7]anyone to [C]see
