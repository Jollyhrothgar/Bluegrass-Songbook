[G]The bright lights of Denver were [C]shining like [G]diamonds
Like ten thousand [D7]jewels in the [G]sky

Where you're [C]goin' or where you [G]come from
And you've judged by the [D7]look in your [G]eye

She [C]saw him that evening in a tavern in [G]town 
In a quiet little [D7]out of the way [G]place
And they smiled at each other 
As [C]he walked through the [G]door
And they danced with their [D7]smiles on their [G]faces
And they danced with a [D7]smile on their [G]face
