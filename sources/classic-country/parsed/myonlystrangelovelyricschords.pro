{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]You accuse me of runnin' [F]all over town
[G7]You make me feel lower than a snake on the [C]ground
You ask me how many [F]strange loves I've known
Well [G7]my only strange love is my strange love at [C]home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Your [F]trust must have rusted it's not [C]workin' any[F]more[C]
You're [D7]lookin' for lipstick when [G7]I step through the door
Your [C]faith in me faded like the [F]end of a song
And [G7]my only strange love is my strange love at [C]home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
We held to each other too [F]long to turn loose
But [G7]you're changin' so fast that I ask what's the [C]use
Your doubt is mistaken and you're [F]takin' me wrong
Cause [G7]my only strange love is my strange love at [C]home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Your [F]trust must have rusted it's not [C]workin' any[F]more[C]
You're [D7]lookin' for lipstick when [G7]I step through the door
Your [C]faith in me faded like the [F]end of a song
And [G7]my only strange love is my strange love at [C]home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Yes [G7]my only strange love is my strange love at [C]home
{end_of_verse}
