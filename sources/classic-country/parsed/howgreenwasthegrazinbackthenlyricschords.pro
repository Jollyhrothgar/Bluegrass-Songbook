{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]The norther came quickly the [Em]clouds filled the [Am]sky
The [Dm]storm brought the [D7]rain and the [Dm]wind [G7]
The [C]dugout was cold and our [Em]blankets were [Am]thin
But how [Dm]green was the [G7]grazin' back [C]then
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Nighthawk is singing as [Em]he makes his [Am]rounds
[Dm]Who hears a [D7]rattle in his [Dm]tins [G7]

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]Every old [G7]man dreams [C]of when he was [Am]young
And [Dm]horses that [G7]run like the [C]wind

Oh how [Dm]green was the [G7]grazin' back [C]then
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I still remember the [Em]unbroken [Am]plains
Or the [Dm]days of the [D7]sod busting [Dm]men [G7]
But our [C]faces were burned by the [Em]west Texas [Am]wind
But how [Dm]green was the [G7]grazin' back [C]then 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I set on the porch in the [Em]cool evening [Am]air 
I [Dm]miss my old [D7]cow puncher [Dm]friend[G7]s
When [C]we didn't care if the [Em]gravy was [Am]thin
How [Dm]green was the [G7]grazin' back [C]then
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
In our [F]minds we were all [G7]trailing the [C]longhorn to [Am]Dodge
How [Dm]green was the [G7]grazin' back [C]then
