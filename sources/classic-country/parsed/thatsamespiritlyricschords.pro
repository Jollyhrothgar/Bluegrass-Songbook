{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Jesus said it is expedient 
For [F]Me to go a[C]way
But I'll send you another Comforter 
To [D7]guide you from day to [G7]day
So they [C]tarried at Jerusalem 
For [F]power from on [C]high
And that same Spirit 
That they [Am]received  
With[C]in my [G7]heart a[C]bides

And I can feel His Holy Spirit 
A [F]dwelling deep with[C]in
Well sometimes it feels so gentle 
And some[D7]times like a mighty rushing [G7]wind
That same [C]Spirit that raised Jesus up 
From [F]death and the [C]grave
It shall raise this old body [Am]up 
And [C]take me [G7]home some[C]day
{end_of_verse}

Oh they laid Him in an empty tomb 
And they [F]rolled a stone at the [C]door
They put soldiers there to guard it 
They [D7]thought they did away with the [G7]Lord
On the [C]third day the stone was rolled away 
He [F]came forth from the [C]grave
And that same Spirit that raised Jesus [Am]up 
Is gonna [C]take me [G7]home some[C]day
