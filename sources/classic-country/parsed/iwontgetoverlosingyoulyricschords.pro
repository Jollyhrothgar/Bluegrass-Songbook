{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Each day my mind begins to [G7]hurt a little [C]more[G7]
It [C]tries so hard to make [Am]things like they were [Dm]before [G7]
But [C]when evening comes [C7]there’s not much left to [F]do
[C]Except to say I won’t get [Dm]over [G7]losing [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
No matter where I go it’s [G7]only you I [C]see [G7]
And [C]when I listen it’s your [Am]voice that speaks to [Dm]me  [G7]
So [C]how can I even [C7]think of someone [F]new
When I [C]know I won’t get [Dm]over [G7]losing [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
But don’t come [F]back if you place [G7]anything a[C]bove me
Don’t [Dm]come back to me if [G7]you can’t really [C]love me [G7]   [C]
There’s [F]been to many hopes of promi[G7]ses come [C]in
To [A7]leave me here and [C]stay away [Dm]again [G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
The [C]days I spend without the [G7]love that once was [C]mine[G7]
Are [C]just so many lonely [Am]hours of wasted [Dm]time [G7]
And [C]somehow the dreams I [C7]dream the whole night [F]through 
[C]All seem to say I won’t get [Dm]over [G7]losing [C]you
{end_of_verse}
