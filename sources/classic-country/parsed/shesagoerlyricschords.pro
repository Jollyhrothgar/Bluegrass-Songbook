[C]Well I think that I should tell you she's a [F]go-er
And [G7]when she goes she won't come back no [C]more
[F]There ain't nothing like it [C]when you've got her all alone
[D7]And there's not anything that can [G7]replace her when she's gone
Aw I [C]envy you until the day [F]she walks back out your door
And [G7]that she's gonna do cause she's a [C]go-er

Now [F]don't let her [G7]stay too [C]long
She'll [F]take the heart [G7]right out of your [C]song
[F]You'll pay the [G7]price for [C]her one time 
But [F]she won't be [G7]back any[C]more
[F]I just thought I'd [G7]tell you she's a [C]go-er

Yes I guess I should have told you she's a [F]go-er
I [G7]should have told you that way back long [C]before
[F]But I was trying to overcome the [C]pain she put me through
[D7]I was fighting to forget her when she [G7]got around to you
Aw [C]you'll be heaven high till [F]she don't want you anymore
Then [G7]she'll be gone again cause she's a [C]go-er
