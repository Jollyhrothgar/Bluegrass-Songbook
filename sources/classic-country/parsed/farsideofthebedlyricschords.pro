{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[D7]All the feeling lived and [G]died [C]in the miles that lay [G]between us
And I love you doesn't [Am]mean much [D7]from the far side of the [G]bed
[D7]Now there's time for looking [G]back [C]the chosen memories [G]for keepin'
And I cry as you [Am]lay sleepin' [D7]on the far side of the [G]bed
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
There was once a raging [C]love on the far side of the [G]bed
Where this touching was [Bm]enough [C]to ease the pain inside my [D7]head
Now I can't turn back the [C]time and I cannot raise the [G]dead
And now there's just a favorite [Am]memory [D7]on the far side of the [G]bed
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[D7]After close of every [G]day [C]there's another day I've [G]missed you
And an empty goodnight [Am]whisper [D7]from the far side of the [G]bed
[D7]With all my memories packed [G]away [C]like a suitcase I'll [G]be taken
I'll be gone when you [Am]awaken [D7]on the far side of the [G]bed
{end_of_verse}
