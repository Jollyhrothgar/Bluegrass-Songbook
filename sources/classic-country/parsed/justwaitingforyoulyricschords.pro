[F]Does your heart still feel delight do you still think you’re right
[G7]That you left me for one you thought [C]true

[C]So lonesome [G7]just waiting for [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]I treasure each thought every memory old pal
[G7]That we spent in the days we once [C]knew
[F]And it hurt so inside many times I have cried
[C]So heartbroken [G7]just waiting for [C]you

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[F]But perhaps dear someday when the clouds drift away
[G7]And the sunshine again fills these [C]blues
[F]You'll mend the break in my heart once again we will start
[C]From where [G7]I've waited so worried and [C]blue
