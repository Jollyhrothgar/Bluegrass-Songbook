It's for those those who go against the grain
Have no fear dare to dream of a [F]change

For [G7]those who choose to play it safe and [F]never stray too far

And it all might come together and it all might come unraveled
On the road less [C]traveled
{end_of_verse}

I've [Am]chosen a [G7]pathway I [F]may not [C]endure

On the road less [C]traveled
