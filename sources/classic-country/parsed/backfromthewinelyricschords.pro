[G]When life gets to [C]rough you [D7]reach for the [G]crutch
And [C]hang on to what you can [D7]find
So [G]when my wife went [C]wild leaving [D7]me with our [G]child
I [C]simply [D7]turned to the [G]wine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And slowly I [C]fell to the [D7]bottom of [G]hell
Where [C]sanity crosses the [D7]line
And [G]just like a [C]fool I [D7]bathe in the [G]pool
The [C]bitter sweet [D7]swirl of the [G]wine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Then [C]my little [D7]girl [C]changed my whole [G]world
She cleared the clouds from my [D7]mind
With [C]love from the [D7]start she [C]tugged at my [G]heart
And [A7]slowly brought me back from the [D7]wine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[G]The road back was [C]rough but [D7]she never gave [G]up
When I [C]stumble she said daddy take your [D7]time
She [G]left me [C]alone with a [D7]faith ever [G]strong
And [C]she led me [D7]back from the [G]wine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[C]She led me [D7]back from the [C]win[G]e
