I'm [C]supposed to tell the [C7]world it never [F]happened
But I'm [C]not the man that [G7]I'm supposed to [C]be

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I'd [F]rather stand up and fight for what's [C]mine
And to [D7]give you up it's just too much for [G7]me

Then I'm [C]not the man that [G7]I'm supposed to [C]be
