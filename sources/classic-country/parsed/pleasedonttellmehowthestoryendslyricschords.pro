{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]This could be our [F]last goodnight [C]together
We may never pass this way [G7]again
[C]Just let me [F]enjoy 'till it's over [C]or [F]forever
Please don't [C]tell me how [G7]the story [C]ends 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
See the way our [F]shadows come [C]together
Softer than your fingers on my [G7]skin
[C]Someday this [F]may be all that we'll [C]remember of each [F]other
Please don't [C]tell me how [G7]the story [C]ends 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]Never's just the echo of [C]forever
[D7]Lonesome as the love that might have [G7]been
[C]Just let me go on [F]loving and [C]believing 'til it's [F]over
Please don't [C]tell me [G7]how the story [C]ends
{end_of_verse}
