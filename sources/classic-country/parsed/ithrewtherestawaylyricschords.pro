{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Met him in a dive down in New Orleans 
I recognized his handsome face
It was none of my business but I had to know 
What he was doing in this kind of place
Cause he [F]use to have money use to have honeys 
He used to be society's prince
But he [C]still wore a grin when I sat beside him 
And [G7]ask where all that money [C]went
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
He said [G7]some was spent on gamblin' 
A lot was spent women a [C]little on some good Cabernet
[G7]Three or four divorces at least as many horses 
That [C]never left the startin' gates
[E7]Diamond rings and furs swamp land in New Jersey 
That [Am]week I spent a [G7]year in L[F]A
You know I [D7]hate to admit [G7]I threw the rest [C]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
He said money don't mean nothing 
Is this game of life it's just a way of keeping score
Show me a man who's got everything 
I'll show you one who wants even more
Well so [F]smoke 'em if you got 'em 
Cause when you hit bottom you gotta have a reason to smile
Hey [C]you can have a little piece of the rock 
I'll [G7]take a little piece of [C]mind
