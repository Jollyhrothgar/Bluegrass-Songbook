{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Last night another held me in his [G7]arms 
A lover's moon was shining bright and [C]clear
He whispered words of love so [G7]tenderly
But I couldn't say the words he longed to [C]hear
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [F]thought of you and things that might have [C]been
I thought of you and it was useless to [G7]pretend
Oh [F]when he asked me if I loved him [C]too
I [G7]closed my eyes sweetheart and thought of [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well as he held me tightly in his [G7]arms 
I tried to find the thrill that we once [C]knew
It could have hurt his heart if he had [G7]known 
That I was just pretending it was [C]you
