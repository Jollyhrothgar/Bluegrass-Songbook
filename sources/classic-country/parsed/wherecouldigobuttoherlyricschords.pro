What makes temp[D7]tation so [G7]sweet

With a girl in a [G7]bar down the [C]street[G7]

[C]I never [G7]meant to be that [C]man
But last night I [D7]held another's [G7]hand

That's [F]not what made me [C]cheat
So I'll try and [G7]explain if I [C]can [F]

[C]Where where [F]where could I [C]go
When I needed [A7]love you [D7]weren't there[G7]

{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]Please for[G7]give my one mis[C]take
And I swear it's the [D7]last I'll ever [G7]make

For lovin' you is a [G7]habit I can't [C]break [F]

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[C]Where where [F]where could I [C]go
When I feel the [A7]urge to go [D7]wrong [G7]
The next [C]time I'm tempted when my [F]glass is [C]emptied
[F]Where will I [C]go [G7]I'll go [F]home[C]
{end_of_verse}
