[C]Is there someone in the night who can make me feel right
I've been feelin' wrong for so [G7]long
Is there someone out there with a dream that I can [C]share
Is there [F]someone who will care if I'm gone or if I'm here
Who can help me set my spirit [C]free
I'm [G7]lonely and I need somebody to [C]love me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I've got tender lovin' words no woman's ever heard
The women I tried turned out [G7]wrong
They were noisy they were fast all the kinds that never [C]last
In this [F]big and lonesome world there's just got to be a girl
Who can help me to solve love's myste[C]ry
I'm [G7]lonely and I need somebody to [C]love me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]I never had a woman waitin' on me at my [C]door
And [F]it's got me feelin' [D7]bad you see
And I just can't take any[G7]more

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
So I'm [C]askin' anyone who had to watch the mornin' sun
Tryin' hard not to [G7]cry
What you feel ain't nothin' new I've been cryin' just like [C]you
Maybe [F]me and you should try to help each other fly
We can be what lovers ought to [C]be
I'm [G7]lonely and I need somebody to [C]love me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I'm [G7]lonely and I need somebody to [C]love
