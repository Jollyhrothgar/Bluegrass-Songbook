{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]As the lights of Tulsa brighten up the partly cloudy Oklahoma [F]skies
It [G7]makes me think of Birmingham wonder why I left that girl [C]behind
This Greyhound bus ain’t fast enough 
I wish the Lord could give me wings to [F]fly[Dm]
Cause I’m [G7]going home to Birmingham with an Alabama woman on my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I’ve slept in every cheat motel and I guess hundred different [F]towns
My [G7]meals have been consisting of assorted brands of California [C]wine
And looking back I can’t believe I let myself get in that state of [F]mind[Dm]
And I’m [G7]going home to Birmingham with an Alabama woman on my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I’ve [G7]counted every fence post from Dallas to the Oklahoma [C]line
I bet I’ve [D7]thumbed through 20 magazines just anything to while away the [G7]time
I’ve got [C]nothing in my pockets but a [Am]pack of gofer [G7]matches and a [F]dime
And I’m [G7]going home to Birmingham with an Alabama woman on my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Yes I’m [G7]going home to Birmingham with an Alabama woman on my [C]mind
I’m [G7]going home to Birmingham with an Alabama woman on my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}
