{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]So many times I've told myself 
We're through it's done that's all
And I think that I've convinced my pride 
That [D7]it must never fall
But even though you can't be true 
I know that I can't win
Cause it [C]don't take long till pride is gone 
And [D7]I'm in your arms [G]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
For just a few lonely hours and a [C]few sleepless nights
[D7]Too many teardrops and a [C]heart that won't beat [G]right
Too many memories and a fight that I can't [C]win
And I'm [G]right back [D7]in your arms [G]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Too many nights I've laid awake 
And prayed for day to come
With my mind made up to just give up 
[D7]Leave and not return
But a smile or two I get from you 
And that old feeling begins
And then it [C]don't take long to turn me on 
And [D7]I'm in your arms [G]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
For just a few lonely hours and a [C]few sleepless nights
[D7]Too many teardrops and a [C]heart that won't beat [G]right
Too many memories and a fight that I can't [C]win
And I'm [G]right back [D7]in your arms [G]again
