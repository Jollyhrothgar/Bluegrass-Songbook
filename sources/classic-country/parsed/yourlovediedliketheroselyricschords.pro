{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]The rose that I planted with [F]such tender [C]care
Is wilted and fading [G7]today
I’ll cherish the [C]blossom that [F]once was so [C]fair
Like a love that’s [G7]gone far [C]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
It seems so unfair and [F]hard to be[C]lieve
That you took my dreams and were [G7]gone
Your reason for [C]leavin’ my [F]heart can’t con[C]ceive
But my tears have [G7]convinced me you’re [C]gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I stand all alone with a [F]rose in my [C]hand
Although it is withered and [G7]old
It’s all I have [C]left with this [F]faded gold [C]band
And a memory I could [G7]never let [C]go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
So dear if you’re mine [F]give a thought to the [C]past
Don’t worry for love comes and [G7]goes
My love for [C]you was [F]made dear to [C]last
Your love bloomed and [G7]died like the [C]rose
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Your love bloomed and [G7]died like the [C]rose
{end_of_verse}
