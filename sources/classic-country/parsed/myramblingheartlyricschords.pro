{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I may be a drifter who wandered from the start
But I saw all the sights there are to touch the human [E7]heart
They say that I'm a gypsy and I'm a ramblin' man
But it grew wise my wanderin' heart since my wanderin' life [Am]began
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]I know life and I know love I felt the good and [G7]bad
I met the true I've met the blue I've met the gay and [C]sad
I know the fears I've seen the tears that untrue hearts can [F]bring
I saw the [C]joy of girl and boy when [G7]true love makes them [Am]sing
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]I have known the bitter and I have known the sweet
And I once knew the broken heart a life so incom[E7]plete 
But now my heart's contented it's happy just to roam
For it grew wise my ramblin' heart now the open road's my [Am]home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I [C]met those who found true love whose hearts were full of [G7]song
I met the bluest hearts untrue who were payin' for their [C]wrong
I hear some laugh I hear some cry as through the towns I [F]roam
But it's too wise my [C]ramblin' heart and the [G7]open road's my [Am]home
