{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]She was like the morning sun 
And when I look upon her face I start [F]believing
[C]Long forgotten dreams that somehow got lost along the [G7]way
[C]Though she shared my life I never dared to dream she’s ever leave [F]me
For she was [C]all a woman could be [G7]and I’ll remember her that [C]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
She was unconcerned with time
And her time was always mine and love came [F]easy
[C]In her hands she held the answers to every question in my [G7]day
[C]And Lord inside her arms she held me soft and warm and always pleased [F]me
She [C]gave herself completely [G7]and I’ll remember her that [C]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And the smile she smiled for me Lord still [F]lingers
[G7]And her tender touch I still feel [C]today
And I’ll never understand how she faded through my [F]fingers
For she was [C]all a woman could be [G7]and I’ll remember her that [C]way
{end_of_verse}
