{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I wonder if [G7]I'll ever [C]forget you

I can't [C]forget [G7]the kisses you [C]gave me
Or memories of your [G7]two baby blue [C]eyes

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I'll always [F]keep a memory [C]of you
And visions of [F]eyes as blue as the [G7]sky

I'm dreaming of your [G7]two baby blue [C]eyes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now when day is done [G7]and shadows are [C]fallin’
My love will sleep till morning [G7]sunrise
I lay [C]awake [G7]just tossing and [C]turning
I'm longing for dreams [G7]of baby blue [C]eyes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Now day after day I[G7] try to keep s[C]miling
And a broken heart I try to dis[G7]guise
Now [C]night after night [G7]my lonely heart's [C]calling
It's calling in vain [G7]for baby blue [C]eyes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I'll always [F]keep a memory [C]of you
