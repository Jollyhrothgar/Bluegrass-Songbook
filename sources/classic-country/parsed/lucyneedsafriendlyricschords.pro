{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]She comes in here each evening 
[C]And she stays till closing [G]time
Some think she's looking for a man 
I believe she's looking for her [D7]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
She's [C]always alone 
Never has too much to [G]say at all
She just [D7]sits and drinks that whiskey 
Stares into the mirror on the [G]wall
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
But Lucy needs a [C]friend 
Just someone she can [G]talk to
I don't believe she needs a [D7]lover 
For she lost that with her youth along the [G]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Yes Lucy needs a [C]friend 
Someone to share her [G]lonely days
And her story has no [D7]end 
Lucy needs a [G]friend
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Once her hair was long and shiny  
[C]And her body full of [G]curves
She lived in a big house with a man 
Who didn't love no one but [D7]her
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Her [C]beauty tempted many men 
Till a stranger won her heart and turned her [G]head
And her [D7]husband swore he'd kill them both
But her turned the gun and took his life [G]instead
