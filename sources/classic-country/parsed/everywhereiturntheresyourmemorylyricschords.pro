{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I turn [Dm]on the radi[A7]o and [Dm]hear your favorite [G7]song
And [C]all day long I [Em]hum the melo[A7]dy
When I [Dm]see that special look
Between two people so in [G7]love
I re[D7]member how it was with you and [G7]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]Everywhere I turn there's your [Em]memory
The [F]image of you [G7]burning up in[C]side me[E7]
It's almost [Am]more than I can [G7]do
To think of [F]anything but [A#7]you
[C]Everywhere I [G7]turn [C]  everywhere I [C7]turn 
[Dm]Everywhere I [G7]turn there's your [C]memory
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
If I [Dm]go somewhere with [A7]friends
Someone's [Dm]sure to mention [G7]you
Then some [C]old familiar [Em]feeling steals back [A7]in
When I [Dm]go to sleep at [A7]night 
You're still [Dm]filling up my [G7]dreams
How I [D7]wish you would fill up my arms [G7]again
{end_of_verse}

It's almost [Am]more than I can [G7]do
To think of [F]anything but [A#7]you
[C]Everywhere I [G7]turn [C]  everywhere I [C7]turn 
[Dm]Everywhere I [G7]turn there's your [C]memory
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}

[Dm]Everywhere I [G7]turn there's your [C]memory
