{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]His [D7]hands paint the flowers 
He puts [Em]leaves on the [G]trees
At His [D7]whisper birds start singing 
When my [G]heart needs [D7]melo[G]dies
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Why I strayed from all His goodness 
My poor [Am]mind can't under[C]stand
I'm to [F]blame for my mis[G]fortune 
I lost [D7]hold of His [G]hands
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Those [D7]hands that give me mercy 
When I'm [Em]wrong as wrong can [G]be
If they [Am]really gave me justice 
I'd be [D7]lost on homeless seas
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I've been [G]lost in the shuffle 
I've [C]obeyed the wrong commands
I'm going [F]back to the [G]chapel 
In [D7]search of His [G]hands
