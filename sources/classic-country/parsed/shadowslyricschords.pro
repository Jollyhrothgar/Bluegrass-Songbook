Let it go let it [G]happen[D7]

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Is it [G]me or is it you 
Tr the [D7]shadow of a dream

Set it [G]free[D7]
Let it [Em]happen like it [G]happened once [C]before
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}

[G]Please kiss me gently darling 
Where the [D7]river runs away
From the [Em]mountains in the springtime 
On a [A7]blue and windy [C]day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
Where there's [G]beauty all around 
As the [D7]shades of nights grow deep
As the [Bm]morning stars grow dim 
They will [C]find us in the [Am]shadows fast [C]asleep
{end_of_verse}

And if [Em]you do not believe me come 
And [C]gaze upon the [Am]shadow at your [C]door
