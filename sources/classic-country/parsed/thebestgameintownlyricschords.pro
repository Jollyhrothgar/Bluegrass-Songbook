{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I was just warming up to this [C]long legged girl with [G]intentions to please
My [Em]blood started [Bm]rushin' as [Em]he laid his [Bm]hand on my [Am]knee
By the [C]look in her eyes I [D7]thought she'd be easy
As she [Em]smiled and told me her [C]name  then she said
[G]I've been here before and [D7]I know the rules to this [G]game
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I've [D7]tried to be cunning I've tried to act naturally [G]mean
You gotta [D7]take what fate deals you maybe this time she's dealt me a [G]queen
And if you play your cards [C]right you'll be with me tonight
And in the morning you'll [D7]still be there
Play 'em wrong and you'll be sitting across from a cold empty [G]chair
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I sure hope you've got what I [C]need so I don't have to [G]look anymore
I [Em]ain't no [Bm]king girl well [Em]I've held some [Bm]jokers [Am]before
As [C]long as we're able to [D7]lay our cards on the table
There's [Em]no need to shuffle [C]around
We [G]know how we [Em]feel let's [D7]go on and deal
This [C]looks like the [D7]best game in [G]town
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
We know how we [Em]feel let's [D7]go on and deal
This [C]looks like the [D7]best game in [G]town
