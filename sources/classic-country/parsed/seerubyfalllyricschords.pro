[C]Well I knew someday Ruby would be [F]leavin'

Yeah so [C]go downtown at nine o'clock this [F]evenin'
Walk [G7]under that red lights then down the [C]hall down the [G7]hall
Look [C]for the highest flyin' girl that's [F]Ruby
And if you'll [G7]wait your turn you'll see Ruby [C]fall

[F]Don't let her know that you even [C]know me

Cause [G7]I don't care to see Ruby [C]fall
