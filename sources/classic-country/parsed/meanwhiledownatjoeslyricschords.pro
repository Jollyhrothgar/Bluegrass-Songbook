{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I iron and I sew as I [F]watch the late show
[G7]But something moist keeps getting in my [C]eyes
He called and said don't wait [F]he'd be working late
And [G7]so another lonely night goes [C]by
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]Meanwhile down at Joe's the music's [C]playing
I can almost see him there [G7]holding her so tight
[F]Meanwhile here at home the baby's [C]crying
[G7]All in all it's just another [C]night
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I polish and I clean then [F]read a magazine
[G7]It's time for bed he'll soon be slipping [C]in
Tomorrow he will be [F]sweet and kind to me
He'll [G7]love me until he works late [C]again
