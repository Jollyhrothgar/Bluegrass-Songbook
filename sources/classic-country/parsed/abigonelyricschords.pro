{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Look around any old crowded bar
You'll see a [F]million reason a million scars
You can [C]hear what the body [A7]language has to [D7]say [G7]
A [C]good libation in celebration a [F]dedication in desperation
If you [C]wanna know why I'm [G7]here let me count the [C]ways
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I only need one good reason to [D7]keep on drinkin'
So I'll [C]have one more I'm not done
Well [F]I'm toast I'll toast [G7]every little thing [C]around
Until [F]the memories are all [G7]gone 
I [C]can't think of one thing [F]wrong
With drinkin' and [G7]thinkin' of the one good reason I have
And it's a [C]big one
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I keep pourin' it in I don't think it shows
There's a [F]hole in my heart where all the whiskey goes
I try [C]fillin' it up but it [A7]just seems to go right [D7]through[G7]
[C]Drink as I may no matter what I do
[F]Never seem to need a reason number two
I count it [C]all on one finger 
It's [G7]always pointin' right at [C]you
Now let me hear you drinkers
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I only need one good reason to [D7]keep on drinkin'
So I'll [C]have one more I'm not done
Well [F]I'm toast I'll toast [G7]every little thing [C]around
Until [F]the memories are all [G7]gone 
I [C]can't think of one thing [F]wrong
With drinkin' and [G7]thinkin' of the one good reason I have
And it's a [C]big one
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Now there's [D7]all kinds of reasons good and bad
There's [G7]about twenty-seven that my brother had
I'd a [A7]had 'em all rather than the one I have
I wouldn't [D7]be here [C]countin' in the [G7]aftermath
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
But I need only [C]one good reason to [D7]keep on drinkin'
So I [C]have one more I'm just drinkin'
And [D7]thinkin' of one good [G7]reason I have
And it's a [C]big one
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
It's a big one I'll tell ya it's a big one
Oh [G7]brother it's a big [C]one
{end_of_verse}
