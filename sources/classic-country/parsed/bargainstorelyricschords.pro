{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[Am]My life is like [G]unto a bargain [Am]store
And I may have just [G]what you're looking [Am]for
If you don't mind the fact that all the [G]merchandise is [Am]used
But with a little [G]mending it could be as good as [Am]new
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Why you take for instance [G]this old broken [Am]heart
If you will just [G]replace the missing [Am]parts
You would be surprised to find how [G]good it really [Am]is
Take it and you never will be [G]sorry that you [Am]did
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The bargain store is open [G]come [Am]inside
You can [G]easily afford the [Am]price
Love is all you need to purchase all the [Am][G]merchandise
And I can guarantee you'll be [G]completely [Am]satisfied
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Take these old used [G]memories from the [Am]past
And these broken dreams and [G]plans that didn't [Am]last
I'll trade them for a future I can't use [G]them [Am]anymore
I've wasted love but I [G]still have some [Am]more
The bargain store is open [G]come [Am]inside
The bargain store is open [G]come [Am]inside
{end_of_verse}
