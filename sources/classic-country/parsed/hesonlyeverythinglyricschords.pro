{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]In the eyes of the world he's [F]only an [G7]ordinary [C]man
But there's a million and one things 
The [F]eyes of the world never [G7]see
He may [F]walk the same he may [G7]talk the same 
As a [C]million others [F]do
Oh but you'd [C]see him as I do 
If his [F]heart had [G7]eyes for [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
He's only [G7]everything only [C]everything
He's as [F]real as the thrill I [G7]feel 
When he walks [C]through my dreams
He's the [F]one I hold when my [G7]world grows cold
And [C]needs a touch of [F]spring
Or a song to [C]sing
[F]Yes in these [C]eyes of mine 
Lord he's [F]only [G7]every[C]thing
{end_of_verse}
