[G]The day you walked [C]away you left the [G]hurt behind

[F]Till everything was gone  [D7]gone  [G]gone

[F]And now I'm left among the ashes [G7]of my dreams
[F]Searching for a reason to go [D7]on
But [G]all that's left is [C]hurt and hurt is [G]not enough
[F]When everything is gone  [D7]gone  [G]gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now in the quiet [C]garden I found [G]peace at last
I've left the hurt [C]behind me in the [D7]past
I [C]walk among the flowers that bloom [G]here in the sun
[F]And all the hurt is gone  [D7]gone  [G]gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[F]But then at night they come and take me [G7]to my room
[F]And like a little child I go [D7]along
And [G]if my room has [C]bars it's not that [G]I've done wrong
[F]It's just my mind is gone  [D7]gone  [G]gone
{end_of_verse}
