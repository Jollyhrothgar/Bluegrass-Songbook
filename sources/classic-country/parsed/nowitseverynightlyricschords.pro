{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]One night a week out on the town 
And that's when I met [G7]you
I found myself believing 
You're the [F]kind that could be [C]true
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But this has gone on long enough 
We both know it's not [F]right
It started out as [C]once a week 
But [G7]now it's every [C]night
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
You [F]didn't wear a wedding ring 
And [C]I thought you were free
I [F]took for granted everything 
And [D7]that's what's killing [G7]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Our [C]happiness can't end like this 
But [F]looks like that it might
It started out as [C]once a week 
But [G7]now it's every [C]night
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I really think you wouldn't 
But there's still a chance you [G7]might 
Decide to not go home at all 
And [F]try to do what's [C]right
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
You have some tall explaining 
And would only serve you [F]right
It started out as [C]once a week 
But [G7]now it's every [C]night
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
You [F]didn't wear a wedding ring 
And [C]I thought you were free
I [F]took for granted everything 
And [D7]that's what's killing [G7]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Our [C]happiness can't end like this 
But [F]looks like that it might
It started out as [C]once a week 
But [G7]now it's every [C]night
