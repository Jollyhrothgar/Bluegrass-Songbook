{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Everyday and every night 
I sit and [F]wonder if I was [Dm]right
For leaving [G7]you for what you did to [C]me [G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I know the [C]thing you did was wrong
But I'm so [F]lonely now that you're [Dm]gone
I guess I'm [G7]wanting for love that cannot [C]be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
It's not so [F]easy to forget seeing [C]you in another's arms
And I [D7]always will regret that I've [G7]lost your lovely charm
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
So every[C]day and every night 
I sit and [F]wonder if I was [Dm]right
For leaving [G7]you for what you did to [C]me
{end_of_verse}
