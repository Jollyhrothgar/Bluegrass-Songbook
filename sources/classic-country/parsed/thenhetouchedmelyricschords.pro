{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]There was a time when I felt I'd never love [F]again 
For [G7]hurt had taken all my love [C]away
My faith was gone and I knew I'd never trust another [F]man
And [C]loneliness was in [G7]my life to [C]stay
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Not long ago I met a man he was so good to [F]me 
I [G7]never thought of him as one to [C]love
He always seemed to be around when I needed [F]company
He [C]made my world a [G7]better place to [C]live
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The other day I noticed he was staring at [F]me 
His [G7]eyes looked at me as if to [C]say
I know that you're a woman starved for love and [F]tenderness
You [C]need the love that [G7]only I can [C]give
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Then he touched me and my [E7]world started [F]turning once [C]again
When he [G7]kissed me my lips started [F]burning once [C]again
When he held me my feet [C7]just wouldn't touch the [F]ground
Now my [C]world's so bright for [G7]there's love all [C]around
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Now my [F]world's [C]so bright for there's [G7]love all [C]around
{end_of_verse}
