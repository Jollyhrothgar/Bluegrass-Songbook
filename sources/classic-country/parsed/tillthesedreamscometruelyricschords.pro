{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]The sun never shines [C7]that I don't think of [F]you 
And [G7]night always finds me a missing [C]you
But the only way [C7]I'm ever close to [F]you 
Is [G7]when I close my eyes and dream of [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I dream of holding you tight each day and [F]night 
And [G7]kissing your sweet  sweet [C]lips
I dream of calling you mine  mine all the [F]time
And I'll [G7]keep dreaming till these dreams come [C]true
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well maybe it never [C7]was meant to [F]be 
And [G7]maybe you never were meant for [C]me
But until I find [C7]a way to be with [F]you 
I'll [G7]keep dreaming till these dreams come [C]true
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}

And I'll [G7]keep dreaming till these dreams come [C]true
