{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I've tried everything I [F]know to make you [C]happy
Never knew someone could be [D7]so hard to [G7]please
Loving [C]you is hard and I'm not sure I'll make [F]it
But at [G7]least I've learned how to stand on my own two [C]knees
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I've still got my pride it's just that [F]I misplaced [C]it
Anyway it's better [D7]lost then no one [G7]sees
Maybe [C]I'm not strong enough right now to hold [F]you
But at [G7]least I've learned how to stand on my own two [C]knees
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
It [G7]wasn't  long ago  you had me [C]crawling
Oh but [F]look how far I've [C]come can't you [G7]see
Well I [C]know I’m still not walking tall but I'm [F]trying
And at [G7]least I've learned how to stand on my own two [C]knees
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Yes I know I’m still not walking tall but I'm [F]trying
And at [G7]least I've learned how to stand on my own two [C]knees
{end_of_verse}
