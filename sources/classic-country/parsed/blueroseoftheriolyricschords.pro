{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Blue rose of the Rio I can see her [D7]now
As she looked that day when I rode away through a golden [G]dawn
It was there by the Rio that we made our [D7]vows
Then we kissed goodbye what a fool was I for I traveled [G]on

[G7]I should have [C]known as we kissed such [D7]heaven as this could only [C]be

[G]Must I wish for manana that will never come [D7]true
Blue rose of the Rio my answer is [G]you
