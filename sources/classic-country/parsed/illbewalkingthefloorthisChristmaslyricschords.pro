{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I'll be walking the floor this [F]Christmas
When old [C]Santa [G7]comes my [C]way
All my friends will be merry this [F]Christmas
But for [C]me just [G7]another blue [C]day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Old [F]Santa may drop by this year to [C]help me light my tree
Cause he [D7]knows that I’m still [G7]blue
I [F]know he’d like to help me dear and [C]bring you back to me
But there’s [D7]some things that Santa just can’t [G7]do
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]I’ll be thinking of you this [F]Christmas
Deco[C]rating my [G7]tree with [C]tears
I'll be walking the floor this [F]Christmas
Like I’ve [C]done for [G7]so many [C]years
{end_of_verse}
