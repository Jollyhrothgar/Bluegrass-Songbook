{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]You were mine for just a while 
Now you're puttin' on the [C]style
And you've never once looked [D7]back 
At your home across the [G]track
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You're the gossip of the town
But my heart can still be [C]found
Where you tossed it on the [D7]ground 
Pick me up on your way [G]down
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Pick me up on your way down
When you're blue and all [C]alone
When their glamor starts to bore [D7]you 
Come on back where you [G]belong
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
You may be their pride and joy
But they'll find another [C]toy
Then they'll take away your [D7]crown 
Pick me up on your way [G]down
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
They have changed your attitude
Made you haughty and so [C]rude
Your new friends can take the [D7]blame 
Underneath you're still the [G]same
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
When you've learned these things are true
I'll be waiting here for [C]you
As you tumble to the [D7]ground 
Pick me up on your way [G]down
{end_of_verse}
