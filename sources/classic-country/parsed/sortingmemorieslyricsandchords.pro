{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]If you've ever spent a night your mind in [F]torture
With your [C]thoughts so disarranged you couldn't [G7]sleep
Then you [C]wish that you could sort out all your [F]memories
And set [C]aside just the [G7]ones you wanna [C]keep
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I have [G7]learned how to sort out my [C]memories
And the [D7]ones that hurt I've learned to push [G7]aside
And with [C]tears I've built a wall of just the sad [F]ones
There the [C]ones of you I've [G7]hidden deep [C]inside
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
If you've spent one night like this well then you're [F]lucky
'Cause I've [C]spent a million thinking of the things we've [G7]done
And I've [C]learned how to cry and go on [F]living
And to [C]sort out my [G7]memories one by [C]one
{end_of_verse}
