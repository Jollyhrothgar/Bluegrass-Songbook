{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]The moment I entered the [F]world of your vision
I [Em]swear that I started to [F]shine

Come like a dream into [F]mine

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]Trembling and holdin' your [F]breath at the wonder

Wild as the freedom I [C]feel in my spirit
So [F]tightly en[G7]tangled in [C]yours[G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
It's a [F]new [G7]game [Am]now

[F]I got that [G7]feelin' in[C]side
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
When it all [G7]came [F]down
Did you think I'd be tried and be [C]true

To love you the [G7]rest of my [C]life
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Standing alone with your [F]soul to the darkness
[Em]Deep as the stars in the [F]sky
Are you the one they have [C]chosen to lead me
I [F]wonder how [G7]far we can [C]fly
{end_of_verse}
