{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Before I [Em]go there's [Am]something [C]I must [F]know 
Just [G7]what's inside of you you can't con[C]trol[G7]
That [C]pulls you like a [Am]puppet [C]on a [F]string 
[G7]Away from me to something un[C]seen
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Is there a [Em]goal [Am]that I have [C]failed to [F]see 
And [G7]does that goal offer more than [C]me [G7]
Is [C]it something or some[Am]one who [C]pulls the [F]string 
[G7]Away from me to something un[C]seen
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I'd be [F]happier to know that there was someone [C]new [G7]   [C]
[G7]At least I'd [F]know there was someone who would take care of [G7]you
[C]Cause what if [Em]there's no [Am]ending [C]to your [F]dream
[G7]That pulled you away to something un[C]seen
{end_of_verse}
