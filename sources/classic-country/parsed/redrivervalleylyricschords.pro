{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]From this valley they [G7]say you are [C]leaving
We shall miss your bright eyes and sweet [G7]smile
For you [C]take with you [C7]all of the [F]sunshine
That has [G7]brighten our pathway a [C]while
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Come and sit by my [G7]side if you [C]love me
Do not hasten to bid me [G7]adieu
Just [C]remember the [C7]Red River [F]Valley
And the [G7]cowboy that loved you so [C]true
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
For a long time my [G7]darling I've [C]waited
For the sweet words you never would [G7]say
Now at [C]last all my [C7]fond hopes have [F]vanished
For they [G7]say that you're going [C]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Come and sit by my [G7]side if you [C]love me
Do not hasten to bid me [G7]adieu

And the [G7]cowboy that loved you so [C]true
{end_of_verse}
