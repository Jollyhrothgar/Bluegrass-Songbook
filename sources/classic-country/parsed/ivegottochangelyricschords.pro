[C]I've got to change and to stop my running [G7]round
[C]She tried so hard to build me up now I'm on my way down
[C7]She tried to keep me happy all I've caused her is [F]pain
[G7]Before all her love has gone I've got to [C]change
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]Oh how can I blame her if she too should run [C]around
[F]At the times when she needs me most [C]I'm in some other [G7]town

[G7]Before all her love has gone I've got to [C]change
