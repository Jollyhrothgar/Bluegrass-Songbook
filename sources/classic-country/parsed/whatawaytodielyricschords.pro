{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]When my baby holds me  [G7]I feel so [C]good
I'll never [D7]leave her  yet I know I [G]should
Though she does me wrong  [G7]I can't say good[C]bye
Someday these blues will [D7]kill me 
But what a way to [G]die
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Tonight I [C]know  if I let her [G]go
Just how [C]lonely life would be for [D7]me
But I'll let her [G]hurt me  
[G7]Let her make me [C]cry
Come on blues and [D7]take me 
What a way to [G]die
{end_of_verse}
