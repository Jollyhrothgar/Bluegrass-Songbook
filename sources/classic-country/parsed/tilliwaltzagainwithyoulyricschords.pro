[C]Till I waltz again with you   let no other hold your [G7]charms
If my dreams should all come true  you'll be waiting for my [C]arms
Till I kiss you once again   keep my love locked in your [G7]heart
Darling I'll return and then   we will never have to [C]part
{end_of_verse}

[C7]Though it may [F]break your heart and [C]mine  [G7]the minute when it's time to [C]go
Remember [F]dear each word [C]divine   [D7]that meant I love you [G7]so
Till I waltz again with [C]you   just the way we are [G7]tonight
I will keep my promise true   for you are my guiding [C]light
