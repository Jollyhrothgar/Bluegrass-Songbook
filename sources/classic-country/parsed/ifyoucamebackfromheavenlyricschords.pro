{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I wouldn't know what to say I wouldn't know [F]what to do
If [Dm]you came back from heaven and [F]I could look at [G7]you
Would I [C]fumble for the words would [F]I be a little shy
Would I [Dm]bust right out with laughter or [F]break right down and [G7]cry

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh [C]if you came back from heaven would it [F]be like it was then
Could we [G7]just pick up where we left off and [F]try it all [G7]again
Oh if [C]you came back from heaven it would [F]freeze me in my [Fm]tracks
And I [C]hope God knows if [Fm]He let you go I'd [Dm]never [G7]send you [C]back
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Do your kisses feel the same do you [F]still have the same touch
[Dm]Will you whisper softly [F]cause you missed me so [G7]much
Have you [C]heard all my prayers when I [F]lay down at night
[Dm]Did you feel my body when I [F]held my pillow [G7]tight
