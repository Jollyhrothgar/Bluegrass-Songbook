{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Living on free food tickets
Water in the milk from the hole in the roof
Where the [F]rain came through what can you [C]do hmm [D7]hmm
[G]Tears from little sister
Crying cause she doesn't have a dress
Without a patch for the [F]party to go
Oh but you [C]know she'll get [D7]by
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]She is [G]living in the love of the [C]common [D7]people
[G]Smiles from the heart of the [C]family [D7]man
[G]Daddy's gonna buy her a [C]dream to [D7]cling to
[G]Mama's gonna love her just as [C]much as she [D7]can as she [G]can
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
It's a good thing you don't have a bus fare
It would fall through the hole in your pocket
And you'd lose it on the [F]snow on the ground
A walking to [C]town to find a [D7]job
[G]Trying to keep your hands warm
But the hole in your shoe let the snow come through
And it [F]chills to the bone
Boy you'd better go [C]home where it's [D7]warm
{end_of_verse}

[G]Mama's gonna love you just as [C]much as she [D7]can as she [G]can

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Living on dreams ain't easy
But the closer the knit the tighter the fit
And the [F]chills stay away
You take 'em in [C]stride family [D7]pride
You know that [G]faith is your foundation
And with a whole lotta love and a warm conversation
And [F]plenty of prayer
Making you [C]strong where you [D7]belong
{end_of_verse}
