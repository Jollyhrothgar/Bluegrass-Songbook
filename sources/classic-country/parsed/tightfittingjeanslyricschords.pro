{meta: artist Conway Twitty}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]She tried to hide it by the faded [C]denim clothes she [G]wore 
But I knew she'd never been [A7]inside a bar [D7]before 
[G]I felt just like a peasant who just [C]had met a [G]queen 
And she knew I saw right through her [D7]tight fitting [G]jeans
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I asked her what's a woman like [C]you doing [G]here 
I see you're used to champagne but [A7]I'll buy you a [D7]beer 
She [G]said you've got me figured out but [C]I'm not what I [G]seem 
And for a dance I'll tell you about these [D7]tight fitting [G]jeans
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[D7]She said I married money I'm used to wearing [G]pearls 
But [C]I've always dreamed of being  [A7]just a good ol' boy's [D7]girl 
So [G]tonight I left those crystal candle [C]lights to live a [G]dream 
And partner there's a tiger in these [D7]tight fitting [G]jeans
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
We danced every dance and Lord the beer [C]that we went [G]through 
I'm satisfied I did my best to [A7]make her dreams come [D7]true 
As [G]she played out her fantasy before [C]my eyes it [G]seemed 
A cowgirl came alive inside those [D7]tight fitting [G]jeans
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
In my mind she's still a lady that's [C]all I'm gonna [G]say 
I knew that I'd been broken by the [A7]time we parted [D7]ways 
And [G]I know I held more woman than [C]most eyes have ever [G]seen 
That night I knew a lady wearing [D7]tight fitting [G]jeans
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Well now [D7]she's back in her world and I'm still stuck in [G]mine 
But [C]I know I'll always [A7]remember the [D7]time 
A [G]cowboy once had a [C]millionaire's [G]dream
And Lord I loved that lady wearing tight [D7]fitting [G]jeans 
{end_of_verse}
