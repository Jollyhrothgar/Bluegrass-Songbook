{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]The corn was dry the weeds were high [F]when Daddy took to [C]drinking          
When [F]him and Lucy Walker [C]they took up and run [G7]away                
Mama cried [C]a tear and then [F]she promised fourteen [C]children      
I [F]swear you'll never see a [G7]hungry [C]day           
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]Oh the [G7]path was deep and wide from footsteps leading [F]to our [C]cabin       
Above the [F]door there burned [G7]a scarlet [C]lamp     
And [G7]late at night a hand would knock 
And there [F]would stand a [C]stranger                   
I'm the [F]son of [G7]Hickory Holler's [C]tramp    
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Mama sacrificed her pride and neighbors started [C][F]talking                  
But I was much [F]too young to understand [C]the things they [G7]said                    
The things [C]that mattered  most of all was [F]Mama's chicken [C]dumplings 
And a [F]goodnight kiss before [G7]we went to [C]bed           
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
When Daddy left and destitution came upon [F]our [C]family                
Not [F]one neighbor volunteered [C]to give a helping [G7]hand                
So let 'em gossip [C]all they want she [F]loved us and she raised [C]us                  
The [F]proof is standing here a full grown [C][G7]man                
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Last summer Mama passed away and left [F]the ones who loved [C]her                
[F]Each and every [C]one is more than grateful for his [G7]birth              
[C]Each Sunday she receives a fresh [F]bouquet of fourteen [C]roses              
And a card [F]that says to the greatest Mom [G7]on [C]earth                
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]Oh the [G7]path was deep and wide from footsteps leading [F]to our [C]cabin       
Above the [F]door there burned [G7]a scarlet [C]lamp     
And [G7]late at night a hand would knock 
And there [F]would stand a [C]stranger                   
I'm the [F]son of [G7]Hickory Holler's [C]tramp
