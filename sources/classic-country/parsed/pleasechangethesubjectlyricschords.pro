{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G7]You've [C]come here to [Em]my house
Your [C]motive to [Em]gossip about the [C]lady 
Who once shared my [G7]world
You [D7]say that she's [G7]wayward and [D7]living in [G7]sin
And I'm [D7]lucky she's no [G7]longer my [C]girl[G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [C]don't need your [Em]gossip go [C]peddle it [Em]elsewhere
The [G7]lady's still [C]part of my [F]mind[D7]
So [F]please change the [G7]subject from [C]her to the [Em]weather
I'd [D7]rather not [G7]think of ol' [C]times[G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I [C]can't talk [Em]about her cause [C]I might start [Em]cryin'
And [C]I'd rather cry all [G7]alone
What [D7]you say she's [G7]doin' are [D7]things I'm not [G7]buyin'
Cause [D7]I've known the [G7]lady too [C]long[G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Her [C]heart was filled with [Em]passion [C]warm and sweet and [Em]gentle
And it's [G7]my fault she's [C]no longer [F]mine[D7]
So [F]please change the [G7]subject from [C]her to the [Em]weather
I'd [D7]rather not [G7]think of ol' [C]times
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I'd [D7]rather not [G7]think of ol' [C]times
