{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Eyes that stay awake until the day is [D7]dawning
Tears that break my heart in [G]two
Chains that bind my heart inside [D7]me
And that's what I get for loving [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Arms that reach out in the [D7]darkness
To hold the love that once was [G]true
Only memories to haunt [D7]me
And that's what I get for loving [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[D7]That's what I get for [G]believing
[D7]That is all I trust in heart in love will never [G]do
All I have is just a [D7]picture
And that's what I get for loving [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Afraid that someday I might see [D7]you
While you're holding someone [G]new
Afraid my heart will fall to [D7]pieces
And that's what I get for loving [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
A path that should be just [D7]forgotten
Is all my heart is clinging [G]to
There's no hope for your [D7]returning
And that's what I get for loving [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
[D7]Is it worth what I am [G]paying
[D7]Should I live my heart keeps trusting [G]you
I know my heart is only [D7]waiting
And that's what I get for loving [G]you
{end_of_verse}
