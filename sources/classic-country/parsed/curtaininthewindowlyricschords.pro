From those sweet tender lips I long to [G]kiss

I hear the ticking of the [C]clock
As it begged me then to [G]stop
Each [A7]picture on the wall seemed to [D7]cry  
And that old [G]rusty gate I can hear it beg me [C]wait
While the [D7]curtain in the window waves [G]goodbye
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
In memory I still can [D7]see
Two arms that once held me [G]tight
Oh how I miss a tender [D7]kiss
From those lovin' lips that I kissed [G]good-bye

I hear the ticking of the [C]clock
As it begged me then to [G]stop
Each [A7]picture on the wall seemed to [D7]cry

While the [D7]curtain in the window waves [G]goodbye
