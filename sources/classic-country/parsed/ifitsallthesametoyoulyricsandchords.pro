It's so [D7]hard to bear the thought you [G]might be changin'
[D7]Especially that you’d want another [G]man
But [D7]I've never been the kind to try [G]arrangin'
[A7]Something that's just not in your [D7]plan

And if it's [C]all the same to [D7]you I'll be [G]leaving in the [C]morning
Though my [Am]life will be an empty road and [C]lonely without [D7]you
Don't spare [C]me any [D7]feelings tell me [G]what your thoughts are [C]forming

I have [D7]tried to give you love and [G]understanding
[D7]But there must be something you want that I don't [G]have

[A7]Then I guess it's best we'd take a different [D7]path

If it's [C]all the same to [D7]you I'll be [G]leaving in the [C]morning

Let's sit [C]down and talk it [D7]over and you should [G]take it as a [C]warning
Cause I'll be [Am]leaving in the [C]morning if it's [D7]all the same to [G]you
{end_of_verse}
