{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I woke up this morning with pounding in my head
My ears fell ringing with the [D7]last few words she [G]said
You know I don't love you I know it ain't right
Starting tomorrow you can [D7]find another [G]liar
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
If I [F]sink any [G]lower I'll go under
If I [F]cry any [C]more I'll go [D7]blind
That [G]woman she [C]left me this [G]morning
Left me to [D7]go out of my [G]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I pleaded and I cried I tried to make her stay
She said I am leaving there [D7]is no other [G]way
I tried with all my heart I cried from the pain
And out from the shadows I [D7]saw the other [G]man 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
If I [F]sink any [G]lower I'll go under
If I [F]cry any [C]more I'll go [D7]blind
That [G]woman she [C]left me this [G]morning
Left me to [D7]go out of my [G]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
And from those words and worry the sorrow and the pain
The thought of losing her it [D7]drove me [G]insane
I just couldn't believe it the thought of what I've done
I laid them both to rest with the [D7]sounds of my [G]gun
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
If I [F]sink any [G]lower I'll go under
Cause I laid them both to rest with the [D7]sound of my [G]gun
{end_of_verse}
