[C]I've got a good woman at home who [F]thinks I do no [C]wrong

Play me some songs about a rambling man put a [F]cold one in my [C]hand 
Cause you know I love to hear those guitar [G7]sounds

[C]Sure enough about closing time I'm [F]stoned out of my [C]mind

And I need to get whiskey [G7]bent and hell [C]bound

[C]Play me some songs about a rambling man put old [F]Jim Beam in my [C]hand

I'll get whiskey [G7]bent and hell [C]bound
