{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]The Sun just went behind a cloud
[F]There's darkness all around me now
For I've [C]just destroyed the world I'm living [G7]in 
[C]I broke her heart so many times
[F]That now at last I've broken mine
And I've [C]just destroyed the [G7]world I'm living [C]in
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
What [F]made me think that I could go on hurting [C]her
I [D7]should have known there'd have to be an [G7]end
[C]But fools in love are taught by fate
[F]They never learn till it's too late
And I've [C]just destroyed the [G7]world I'm living [C]in
