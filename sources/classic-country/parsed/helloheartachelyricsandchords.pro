{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Hello heartache I should have known you'd come my [G7]way
Since she left me all my dreams have gone [C]astray
She was all I had to live for now my every hope is [F]gone
So I [C]guess you'll be here [G7]with me from now [C]on
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Hello teardrops why do you fall like winter [G7]rain
It's too late now for she won't be back [C]again
And there's nothing you can do to ease this longing in my [F]heart
For I'll [C]miss her just as long [G7]as we're [C]apart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
For [G7]awhile I thought [C]she loved me all of [G7]that is over [C]now
And I [G7]tried to make her [C]happy but I [D7]failed her somewhere [G7]somehow
[C]Hello grey skies where are the shining stars [G7]above
Do you miss them as I'll always miss my [C]love
If you do then I'll stay with you all night long until the [F]dawn
For I [C]know that I can't [G7]sleep now that she's [C]gone
{end_of_verse}
