{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Maybe the [G7]first time I [C]saw them I was nine going [G7]on ten years [C]old
[F]I fell in love with their [C]music and with the [D7]stories their music [G7]told
I had [C]all of their [G7]long playing [C]records 
And [Am]memorized songs I [F]still can't [G7]forget
[F]My room was papered with [C]pictures of the [F]All Girl All [G7]Gospel Quar[C]tet

Flora was [G7]oldest and [C]tallest she sang the [G7]high sopra[C]no
[F]Alma played the [C]piano and [D7]sang the sweetest al[G7]to
Bonnie [C]Mae sang [G7]bass and sold [C]records I [Am]bought every[F]one I could [G7]get
And my [F]favorite little Louise sang [C]tenor in the [F]All Girl All [G7]Gospel Quar[C]tet
{end_of_verse}

And their [G7]harmony sounded like [C]angels and [Am]I can [Em]still hear them [G7]yet

{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Somewhere just [G7]after my [C]childhood I lost track and [G7]they lost some [C]ground
[F]Only in bargain store [C]basements or flea [D7]markets could their records be [G7]found
I heard [C]one lives in [G7]Akron [C]Ohio one [Am]quit to take [F]care of her [G7]dad
[F]One's on TV in [C]Atlanta and the [F]one they called [G7]Louise went [C]bad

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
If any of the [G7]four of you [C]hear me there's a song I [G7]never could [C]find
It's [F]the one where Alma played [C]guitar and [D7]Bonnie Mae sang after [G7]time
And it's [C]sad now how [G7]no one [C]remembers though [Am]I find them [F]hard to [G7]forget
[F]And you would if you'd ever [C]heard them the [F]All Girl All [G7]Gospel Quar[C]tet
