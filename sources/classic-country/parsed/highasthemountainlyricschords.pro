{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]They say that too much water has run under the [C]bridge
[D7]That we never can live down the [G]past
That once your love has ended it never can [C]return
But [D7]that's not so for we both know that our love will [G]last
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
High as the mountain deep as the [C]sea 
[D7]Tall as the tallest tallest [G]tree
That's how much I love you that's how much you love [C]me
[D7]High as the mountains deep as the [G]sea
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
It might be they're just jealous and don't want to [C]understand
[D7]That our love will pass the test with room to [G]spare
But it's just their conscience talking of their broken dreams and [C]plans
[D7]For it shows and we both know that our love is [G]fair
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
High as the mountain deep as the [C]sea 
[D7]Tall as the tallest tallest [G]tree
That's how much I love you that's how much you love [C]me
[D7]High as the mountains deep as the [G]sea
{end_of_verse}
