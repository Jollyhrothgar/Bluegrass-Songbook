{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Well I got off work and headed for town to have a [D7]few
Determined I would drown the pain of losing [G]you
But this couple on the dance floor were dropping quarters in a [C]slot
And this [D7]heartless thing kept spinning old [G]forget-me-nots
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The jukebox played along to my misery in [C]song
Just as if [D7]it felt the pain that I was going [G]through
Oh it wailed out Crying Time and You Were Always On My [C]Mind
I was [D7]singing the blues and the jukebox played [G]along
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well the more I drank the more it became a [D7]mystery
How the men who wrote these songs wrote then just for [G]me
They must have hid out in my closet or they had to read my [C]mail
Lord I [D7]must have heard at least ten dollars worth of [G]Hell
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Oh the jukebox played along to my misery in [C]song
Just as if [D7]it felt the pain that I was going [G]through
It played I'm Born To Lose and I Can't Stop Loving [C]You
I was [D7]singing the blues and the jukebox played [G]along
{end_of_verse}

[D7]They played Watson and Jones Travis kept picking up [G]bones

[D7]They played Haggard and Hank give me another [G]drink
