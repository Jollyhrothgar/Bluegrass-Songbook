{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Looking out the [Am]window
I can [G]see the tops of [Am]buildings
So much [G]taller than you'd ever see back [C]home
[Am]Driving through the [D7]driving rain
The [Am]city lights all [D7]look the same
And [F]all it means is [Em]one more night [Dm]alone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G]It's not so bad in [Am]summer
But [G]December makes me [Am]wonder
How a [G]country boy could feel more out of [C]place
[Am]Traffic lights and [D7]foreign cars
[Am]Plastic smiles in [D7]crowded bars
I'd [F]trade it all for [Em]one familiar [D7]place
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
But when the [G]rain turns to [C]snow
And [D7]all the city shops are filled 
With [C]toys and mistle[G]toe
[Bm]That's when I'll be on my [C]way
When the [Am]rain turns to [D7]snow [Am]
I'll be [D7]home on Christmas [G]day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Staring at the [Am]ceiling
In my [G]room I get the [Am]feeling
That there's [G]nothing in this town that's worth my [C]time
[Am]Every night I'm [D7]here I dream
Of [Am]country roads and [D7]mountain steams
But [F]most of all the [Em]one I left [D7]behind
{end_of_verse}
