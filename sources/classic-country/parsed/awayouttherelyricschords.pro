[C]A lonely spot I know where no man will [G7]go 
Where the shadows have all the [C]room
I was [G7]riding free on that old [C]S-P
[D7]Humming a southern [G7]tune
When a man [C]came along made me hush my [F]song 
Kicked me [C]off [G7]away out [C]there

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
As she pulled out of sight I turned to the [G7]right
The left and [C]everywhere
All I [G7]could see was a cactus [C]tree
[D7]A prairie dog playing [G7]there
I watched the [C]prairie dog eat on the [F]tumbleweed
That's his [C]home [G7]away out [C]there

Then I threw down my load in the desert [G7]road
Rested my weary legs [C]too
Watched the sinking [G7]sun make the tall shadows [C]run
[D7]Across that barren [G7]plain
Then I [C]hummed a tune to the rising [F]moon
He gets [C]lonesome way [G7]out [C]there
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Then I closed my eyes to the starlit [G7]skies
Lost myself in [C]dreams
I dreamed the desert [G7]sand was a milk-and-honey [C]land
[D7]Then I awoke with the [G7]dawn
There's a train [C]coming back on the one-way [F]track
Going to [C]take me [G7]away from [C]here
