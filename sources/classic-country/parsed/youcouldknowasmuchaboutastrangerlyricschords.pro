{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Our bodies lay here side by side
[C]But our thoughts have turned the other [G]way
[C]We make the conversation of two people who have nothing left to [G]say
[C]We're so accustomed to each other we no longer care or [D7]bother
[C]And there lies the [G]danger
[C]You know the style of clothes I wear and you know how I comb my [D7]hair
[G]But you could know as much [D7]about a [G]stranger
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]I can't remember the last time that I really wanted [G]you
[C]And we both say nothing's wrong but its here in everything we [G]do
[C]So we get up from our bed leaving many things [D7]unsaid
[C]And there lies the [G]danger
[C]Many of my words you don't hear and you seldom notice if I'm [D7]near
[G]But you could know as much [D7]about a [G]stranger
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]What went wrong I can't name it find the fault I can't blame [D7]it
[C]On any one [G]thing
[C]We're so used to things this way tomorrow's just like [D7]yesterday
[C]And there lies the [G]danger
[C]You know the color of my eyes you know the things that I [D7]despise
[G]But you could know as much [D7]about a [G]stranger
{end_of_verse}
