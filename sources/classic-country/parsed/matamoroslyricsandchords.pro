{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]In old Mexico I stand on the square in Mata[C]moros
Round [D7]the plaza the couples are walking to music so [G]sweet
I found my love not too long ago in Mata[C]moros
But [D7]I’m feeling low as the beggar who sits in the [G]street
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh the [C]promises that she made with eyes black as midnight
[A7]How could I know how fickle her promise could [D7]be
Now [G]I’m back to find what I feel is mine in Mat[C]amoros
And [D7]there’ll be bad trouble if I catch her cheating on [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Streets are narrow and dark and Tequila runs free in Mata[C]moros
I stop [D7]for one moment outside of Miguel’s swinging [G]door
My heart breaks to hear the same haunting sound of [C]Granada
She [D7]once called it our song and vowed she’d be mine [G]evermore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Then a[C]cross the square with this wild young Vaquero I see her
[A7]Laughing and dancing and tossing her raven black [D7]hair
Fate [G]may take a hand when I face this man from Mata[C]moros
For the [D7]love of my woman is one thing that I'll never [G]share
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Now I walk in the night far away from the lights of Mata[C]moros
And re[D7]call the last moments when I knew she loved me more than [G]life
I can still hear her cry I love you and I’ll prove it [C]Manana
Then [D7]seeing my danger she jumped in front of his [G]knife
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
I know [C]of the stories they’ll tell in the dim lit casinos
[A7]Of the raven haired beauty who for her love lay dead on the [D7]floor
They’ll [G]speak of the fight with the gringo that night in Matoa[C]moros
And [D7]wonder what happened for he never returned any[G]more
{end_of_verse}
