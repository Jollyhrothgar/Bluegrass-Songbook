{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[D7]I know you're [G]tired  of being all [F]I ever [C][G7]wanted
You no [Am]longer feel the [D7]love I have for [G]you
[D7]What happens [G]now  what will I do [F]with all [G7]the [C]mem'ries
And the [Am]dreams [D7]of all the [Am]things we'll [D7]never [G]do
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But I won't mention it [Am]again I won't think [D7]about [G]tomorrow
Just let it [Am]happen live each [D7]hour day by [G]day
But [G7]let me [C]tell you before you go  [D7]how much I love [G]you 
[E7]Then I won't mention it [Am]again  I [D7]won't mention it [G]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[D7]I feel my [G]life has reached an early [F]sign [G7]of [C]autumn
In my [Am]heart the leaves are [D7]falling  love is [G]cold
[D7]And everything [G]that once was warm [F]and new is [G7]gone [C]now
Leaving [Am]noth-ing [D7]but this [Am]hun-ger [D7]in my [G]soul
{end_of_verse}
