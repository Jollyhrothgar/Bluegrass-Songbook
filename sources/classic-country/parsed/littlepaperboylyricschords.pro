{start_of_verse: Verse 1}

These words he said with tears in his [C]eyes

Please buy [G7]a paper from me
So I can get me something [C]to eat
My clothes are ragged [G7]no shoes on my feet
Said the little paper boy there on the [C]street
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Out in this cold wide [G7]world all alone
I have no place on this earth to call [C]home
I haven't had the chance that [G7]other kids had
I have no mother nor even [C]a dad
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Early next morning as the [G7]crowd passed by

The little paper boy who died in the [C]snow
