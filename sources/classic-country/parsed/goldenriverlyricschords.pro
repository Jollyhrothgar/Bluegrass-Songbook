[C]I hate to see night shadows fall I [F]hate to see a moon [C]above
For it brings me dreams of days gone [G7]by
When my [C]darling Lola Lee strolled [F]along the shore with [C]me
And we watched the golden [G7]river glide on [C]by

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Golden river [F]golden river [C]you took my love from [G7]me
On your waves [C]of golden hue you carried her with [F]you
And [C]broke my heart a [G7]million million [C]ways
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now I sit and wonder why I feel so [F]blue and want to [C]cry
While I watch the moon climb slowly in the [G7]sky
It was [C]on a night like this when she [F]gave me her last [C]kiss
Climbed in her birch [G7]canoe and sailed [C]away
{end_of_verse}

On your waves [C]of golden hue you carried her with [F]you
And [C]broke my heart a [G7]million million [C]ways
