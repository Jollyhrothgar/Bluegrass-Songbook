{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]A man and a train a train and a man
They [C]both tried to run as [G]far and as fast as they [F]can
[Dm]But a [D7]man's not a train and a train's not a [C]man
A [Dm]man can do things that a train never [G]can
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Going up a mountain even half way to the [C]top
The minute [D7]that a train runs out of steam it's gotta [G]stop
But it's a different story when a man runs out of [C]steam
He still can go a [G]long long way on [D7]nothing but a [G]dream
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Going cross the country when a train runs out of [C]track
It has to stop and [D7]turn around and then start headin' [G]back
But many miles from nowhere out where all the tracks are [C]gone
A man who's got [D7]himself a dream can still keep going [G]on
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
So don't try to stop me don't try to stop me cause nobody [C]can
I've [D7]got a dream a beautiful dream and that makes me a [G]man[D7]
No don't [G]try to stop me don't try to stop me cause nobody [C]can
I've got a [D7]dream a beautiful dream and that makes me makes me a [G]man
{end_of_verse}
