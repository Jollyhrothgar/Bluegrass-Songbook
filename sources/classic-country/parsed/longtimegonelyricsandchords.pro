You can bet that I will [G7]be a long time [C]gone

For every time you lied to me
I told myself that this can't [Dm]be
I know I was completely wrong
You can bet that I will [G7]be a long time [C]gone

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
My mind's been on you day and night
But now I finally saw the [Dm]light
I'm gonna tell you now so long
You can bet that I will [G7]be a long time [C]gone

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}

And he was crying for his [Dm]love
I'm sorry that he's all alone
But for me I'm glad I'll [G7]be a long time [C]gone
