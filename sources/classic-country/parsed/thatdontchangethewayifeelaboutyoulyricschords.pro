[C]My old pickup truck
Seems it [F]just can't keep [C]up
And my boots ain't as new as I'd [G7]like 
But [C]that don't change the way I [F]feel about [C]you 
Just the way [G7]that you feel about [C]me 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Tomorrow's a new day
Start [F]changin' your old [C]ways
You told me this time and [G7]again 
I'm [C]not the kind to ever [F]give up on [C]you
Just because [G7]you don't give up on [C]me 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I've [F]tried and I've tried
To [C]keep you satisfied
I can give about all I can [G7]give  
But [C]that don't change the way I [F]feel about [C]you 
Just the wa[G7]y that you feel abou[C]t me 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Spendin' and offendin'
Never [F]tendin' or [C]mendin'
Or talkin' 'bout bein' a [G7]star
But [C]you'd be surprised if you'd [F]open your [C]eyes
And took a look [G7]to see just who you [C]are
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}

But [C]that don't change the way I [F]feel about [C]you 
Just the wa[G7]y that you feel abou[C]t me
