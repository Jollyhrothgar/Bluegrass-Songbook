{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I can't tell my heart that you don't love [G7]me 
I can't say the love we had was [C]blind
It's true you left dear for [G7]another 
But I can't tell my heart that you're that [C]kind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]Each night I hug my pillow I make [G7]believe it's [C]you
But it [D7]can't take the place of a lovely girl like [G7]you
[C]I can't tell my heart that you don't love [G7]me
So I'll just fool my heart the way that you fooled [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I was blinded by your charm and [G7]glamour 
I thought I'd found the love so true and [C]real
Now I will pay the price in tears and [G7]sorrow
And there's no words to tell you how I [C]feel
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[F]You just laughed and told me to [G7]find another [C]love
But [D7]instead of this I pray I'll win your [G7]love
[C]So I can't tell my heart that you don't love [G7]me
I'll just fool my heart the way that you fooled [C]me
{end_of_verse}
