[C]I'd love to spend this Christmas with the [F]folks in my hometown

Seem to [D7]say welcome [G7]home to[C]night

Christmas [G7]carols softly [C]singing by the [F]fireside [G7]all a[C]glow
Children's [G7]laughter gaily [C]ringing as they [D7]battle in the [G7]snow
My [C]heart is winging homeward as the [F]snow comes fallin' down
Oh I’d [G7]love to spend this [C]Christ[A7]mas with the [D7]folks in [G7]my home[C]town
