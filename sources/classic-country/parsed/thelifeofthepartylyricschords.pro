{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]The neighbors keep calling all the [C7]time since you’ve [F]gone
Complaining a [C]party that [D7]last until [G7]dawn
But how can I [C]tell them that I’m [C7]afraid of the [F]dark
And memories that [C]call  [G7]a new broken [C]heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I fill up their [F]glasses make them all feel at [C]home
I’m the life of the [G7]party  till the last one is [C]gone
That’s the time that I’m [F]dreading when they’ve all said [C]goodbye
Then the life of the [G7]party  will [F]break down and [C]cry
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I fill up their [F]glasses make them all feel at [C]home
I’m the life of the [G7]party  till the last one is [C]gone
That’s the time that I’m [F]dreading when they’ve all said [C]goodbye
Then the life of the [G7]party  will [F]break down and [C]cry
{end_of_verse}
