[C]I once stood [F]in the darkness [C]I [F]couldn't see a [C]light
Backed up against [F]the wall I built [C]around my [G7]life
[C]I'd run [F]out of [C]reasons to ever [F]love [C]again
But somehow you [F]found a [C]door and [G7]you came waltzing [C]in
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Walls can [F]fall storms can [C]end
Sky's can clear hearts can [G7]mend
[C]All it [F]took was your sweet love to [C]rise above it [F]all
You can [C]build 'em [F]strong and [C]tall but [G7]walls can [C]fall
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Here we [F]stand [C]together with [F]stones enough to [C]build
A bridge into forever [F]beyond the [C]highest [G7]hill
The [C]past will [F]fade behind [C]us if we let [F]the future [C]shine
Not a thing can [F]come [C]between us if we [G7]always keep in [C]mind
