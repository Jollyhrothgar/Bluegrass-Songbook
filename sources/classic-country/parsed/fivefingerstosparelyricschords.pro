{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Love for [D7]you has been so strong like a [G]fool I've gone along
With my [D7]feet both planted firmly in the [G]air
I've been [D7]so in love with you I just [G]thought you loved me too
But at [D7]last I'd figured out that you don't [G]care
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I've been [D7]counting all the times that you told me you are mine
The times you said how much you [C]care
And I [D7]counted all of them on the fingers of one hand
And [C]I still have five [D7]fingers to [G]spare
(And [C]I still have five [D7]fingers to [G]spare)
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Since I [D7]counted one by one and the [G]answer came to none
I don't [D7]think you love me any maybe [G]less
And if [D7]what I think is true nothing's [G]good enough for you
And so [D7]I'll just give you nothing after [G]this
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I've been [D7]counting all the times that you told me you are mine
The times you said how much you [C]care
And I [D7]counted all of them on the fingers of one hand
And [C]I still have five [D7]fingers to [G]spare
{end_of_verse}
