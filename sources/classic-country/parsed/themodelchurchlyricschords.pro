{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Well wife I've found a [F]model [C]church and worshiped there to[G7]day
It made me [C]think of the [F]good old [C]times before my hair was grey
The meeting house was [F]finer [C]built than they were years [G7]ago
But I found [C]out when [F]I went [C]in it was not built for show
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The sexton did [F]not set me [C]down away back by the [G7]door
He knew that [C]I was [F]old and [C]deaf and saw that I was poor
He must have been a [F]Christian [C]man he lead me boldly [G7]through
The long aisle [C]of that [F]crowded [C]church to find a pleasant view
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I wish you'd heard [F]the singing [C]wife it had the old time [G7]ring
The preacher [C]said [F]with trumpet [C]voice let all the people sing
Oh Coronation [F]was the [C]tune the music upward [G7]rolled
I thought I [C]heard the [F]angel [C]choir strike on their harps of gold
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I tell you wife [F]it did me [C]good to sing those hymns once [G7]more
I felt just [C]like [F]some wrecked [C]marine who gets a glimpse of shore
It made me want [F]to lay [C]aside this weather beaten [G7]form
And anchor [C]in [F]that blessed [C]port forever from the storm
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Dear wife the toil [F]will soon be [C]o'er the victory soon be [G7]won
The shining [C]strand [F]is just [C]ahead our race is nearly run
We're nearing Canaan's [F]happy [C]shore our hopes so bright and [G7]fair
Thank God we'll [C]never [F]sin a[C]gain there'll be no sorrow there
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
There'll be no sorrow [G7]there [C]in heaven above where [F]all is love
There'll [C]be no [G7]sorrow [C]there
{end_of_verse}
