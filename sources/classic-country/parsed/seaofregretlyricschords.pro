{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]The love that you promised to me on that [G7]day
Is now gone forever like the vows that you [C]made
My heart is so empty [C7]it's easy to [F]tell
Like a ship on the [C]ocean I'm [G7]lost without [C]sail
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
When you walked away my heart went [G7]with you
You stole it from m-[C]e the day we met
And now I must live my life in [G7]sorrow
No home just a drifter on the sea of [C]regret
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
On the day I first saw you my heart said to [G7]me
There is the angel you see in your [C]dreams
And I know it must be [C7]for the way that I [F]feel
You're only a [C]dream girl [G7]I know you're not [C]real
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
When you walked away my heart went with [G7]you
You stole it from m-[C]e the day we met
And now I must live my life in [G7]sorrow
No home just a drifter on the sea of [C]regret
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[G7]No home just a drifter on the sea of [C]regret
