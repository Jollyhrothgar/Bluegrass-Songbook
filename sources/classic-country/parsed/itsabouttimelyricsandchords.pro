{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I swore last night when I walked out those swinging doors
That [G7]I wouldn't let myself [F]go there any[C]more

And how [F]else can I for[G7]get I still love [C]you

It's about [F]time those city lights are [C]calling
It's about time my teardrops just started [G7]falling
It's about [C]time he's been on my mind all [F]day
Turn out the [C]jukebox bring out the [G7]bottle I'm on my [C]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I know it's wrong to do the things I do
But [G7]it helps this aching heart for[F]get it just lost [C]you
I just can't make these eyes of mine stay dry
But I [F]know the perfect [G7]place to sit and [C]cry
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}

Turn out the [C]jukebox bring out the [G7]bottle I'm on my [C]way
