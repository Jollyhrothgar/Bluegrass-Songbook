[F]And all the beams were [C]made of dreams that [D7]I laid at your [G7]feet
[C]The walls were made of sunshine the sunshine of your [G7]smile
And all the bliss of that first kiss was mine for just a [C]while

This is the boy who destroyed the house that [G7]love built

I'll build from love that's strong enough to stand the test of [C]time
