{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Seeing you sittin' alone [G7]stranded with your heart broke down
[F]Reminds me of [C]everything wrong with the [G7]world right now
It [C]seems nobody takes pride in [G7]anything they do or say
They [F]give their word but it [C]ain't worth very [G7]much these days
Maybe [Am]I'm [G7]old [F]school behind the [Am]times [G7]but [F]I 
[Am]Still believe if a [A#7]man does something he [G7]ought to do it right
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
So when [F]I make love it's [C]made to last
And when [Dm]I build trust [G7]it's [Am]built to stand fast
Oh everything [F]I start I [C]see it to the end
If you let me [Dm]fix your heart it's [G7]never gonna break [F]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]Whoever had your heart before [G7]left it in pretty bad shape
If he [F]gave it the time and the [C]care it needs well he [G7]did it too late
It's [C]gonna take a little work but it's [G7]nothing that I can't do
[F]Piece by piece I'll [C]put it together back [G7]better than new
And it [Am]comes [G7]with [F]my life[Am]time [G7]guaran[F]tee
Just [Am]put your heart in [A#7]my good hands and [G7]girl you'll see
