Never spoke till it was over
I think you knew it at the [G7]start

A-looking so satisfied you just stood there
And [G7]watched her break my [C]heart

Well [F]you knew what was [C]going on

Like the [D7]cat that swallowed [G7]the canary

And it's full of [G7]pain and mise[C]ry

[C]You stood there while the pieces fell
You just stood there and you wouldn't tell
You just stood there and [G7]watched her break my [C]heart
