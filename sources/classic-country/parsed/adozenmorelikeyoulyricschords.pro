{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Intro:
[G]I wouldn’t take a million [C]dollars for your [G]love you know it’s true
But I wouldn’t give a nickel for a dozen [D7]more just like [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I think I’d give my right and [C]left arms both [G]before I’d let you go
At the [D7]same time I’d be wishing that I [C]didn’t love you [G]so
The truth would be that hate is [C]standing right [G]beside my love for you
Just a-[A7]waitin’ should I find somebody [D7]new
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
For I’ve had to [G]spend these lonely [C]days and nights 
[G]Without you from the start
But I [D7]never do get used to being [C]always sick at [G]heart
I wouldn’t take a million [C]dollars for the thread of [G]love I’m hanging to
But I wouldn’t give a nickel for a dozen [D7]more just like [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[D7]Maybe it’s because I’ve known you [C]for a long long [G]time
You just grew on my heart and [A7]you got on my [D7]mind
Cause I wouldn’t [G]take a million [C]dollars 
For your [G]love you know it’s true
But I wouldn’t give a nickel for a dozen [D7]more just like [G]you
