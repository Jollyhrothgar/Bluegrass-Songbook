{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Today I made a point to go somewhere I knew you'd [G7]be
I had to know if you still had the same affect on [C]me
And the moment that I saw you there I [F]knew
No matter [C]what I do  [G7]I'm still not over [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I'm still not over [G7]you that feeling's still the [C]same
I'm still not over [G7]you I find that nothings [C]changed
And perhaps some day I'll [C7]find somebody [F]new
But now it's [C]much too soon  [G7]I'm still not over [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I can't explain why seeing you affects my [G7]sanity
But when I see you I become a strange and different [C]me
And the moment that I saw you there I [F]knew
No matter [C]what I do  [G7]I'm still not over [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I'm still not over [G7]you that feeling's still the [C]same
I'm still not over [G7]you I find that nothings [C]changed
And perhaps some day I'll [C7]find somebody [F]new
But now it's [C]much too soon  [G7]I'm still not over [C]you
{end_of_verse}
