{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Now Lefty came from Texas at least that what they [G7]say
He [C]cut a record down in Dallas it really got him on his way 
You could [D7]hear him on every jukebox
In every town and state every DJ played Always [G]Late
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Now Lefty wasn't no saint he didn't claim to [G7]be
He [C]could sing a country song send cold chills through me
Like the [D7]son of a Saginaw fisherman
He sang in Saginaw [G]Michigan
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
If [C]you got the money honey I've got the time
When he [G]sang that song well he nearly blew my mind
I'd walk for miles cry or [D7]smile for my [G]mama and [C]daddy
And it [G]tears me up to [D7]see a grown man [G]cry
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Lefty left us lonely he left before his [G7]time
But I [C]can see 'im singin' now to an angel at that Opry in the sky
I'm just an [D7]old old man a-lookin' for fun
Why oh why do you do me this [G]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
If [C]you got the money honey I've got the time
When he [G]sang that song well he nearly blew my mind
I'd walk for miles cry or [D7]smile for my [G]mama and [C]daddy
Oh [G]why oh why oh [D7]why do you do me this [G]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Yeah Oh why oh why oh [D7]why do you do me this [G]way
[D7]Always [G]Late
