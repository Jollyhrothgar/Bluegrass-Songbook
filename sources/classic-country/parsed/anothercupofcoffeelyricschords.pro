{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I just stopped by to have a cup of [G7]coffee
[C]And get some things I left when he moved in
[G7]I can't stay too long 'cause I've got someone waiting
[C]I got to hurry up and meet a friend
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G7]Well it's working out just fine since he took over
[C]'Cause that leaves me lots of time to live it up
[G7]I'm almost late I really should be going
[C]But I guess there's time for just another cup
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]I see you've rearranged the way the house [C]was
[G7]You've added some and took some things away
[C]Could you warm this half-a-cup here that I'm [G7]holding
[C]I don't have much time I must be on my way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[G7]Well I've talked so long and all you've done is listened
[C]And that coffee pot's been empty for an hour
[G7]My friend's upset but I know how to please her
[C]I'll stop somewhere and buy some pretty flowers
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[G7]It's too late to pick up what I came by for
[C]And if I left them do you really think he'd mind
[G7]'Cause like I said I'm late and she won't like it
[C]I'll drop by and pick them up some other time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
[F]Well it's funny when you think what life can [C]offer
[G7]When everything in life is up for trade
[C]I was only driving by just thought I'd drop [G7]in
[C]'Cause I always liked the coffee that you made
[G7]'Cause I always liked the coffee that you [C]made
{end_of_verse}
