{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I don't ask you Lord to lighten up my [G7]burden
I don't mind the trials on earth that I go [C]through
Being down I want to prove that I am [F]worthy
Of a little [C]spot in [G7]Heaven close to [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Years ago my Mother taught me all your [G7]meaning
Of the hardship and the pain that you went [C]through
Know you Lord that I am ready and I'm [F]waiting
For a little [C]spot in [G7]Heaven close to [C]you [C7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Precious [F]Lord forget me not don't pass me [C]by
[G7]Though there must be others worthier than [C]I  [C7]
If you [F]can then Lord here's what I'll have you [C]do
[G7]Save a little spot in Heaven close to [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
If my wish is more than I deserve forgive[G7] me
Up in Heaven any place would surely [C]do
But I've done my best on earth that's why I'm [F]asking
For a little [C]spot in [G7]Heaven close to [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
At the altar years ago we got [G7]acquainted
And as time went on the love in my heart [C]grew
If it isn't asking too much Lord then save [F]me 
Just a little [C]spot in [G7]Heaven close to [C]you
{end_of_verse}
