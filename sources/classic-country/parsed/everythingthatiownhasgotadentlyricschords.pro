[C]I'll drive around with the trunk tied down with a [F]bungee cord
Because I [Dm]hopped a curb and backed [G7]into her new [C]boyfriends Ford[G7]

It's [Dm]about the size and [G7]shape of my right [C]busted fist

She used to say I'm a man that's way to [F]hard on stuff
She [Dm]let me know that [G7]that also goes [C]for our love[G7]

Better days gone [D7]heart just keeps on [F]beating any[G7]ways
