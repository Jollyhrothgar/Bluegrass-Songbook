[G]So your new love let your feelings sad and [D7]blue

And I'm glad that I can say I told you [G]so
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
When you cry yourself to sleep remember [D7]me
Think of all the things I told you long [G]ago
You know how it feels to be the used to [D7]be
And I'm glad that I can say I told you [G]so
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
So your someone broke your heart you rea[D7]lize
That the time has come to reap just what you [G]sow
For somebody else told you the same old [D7]lie
And I'm glad that I can say I told you [G]so
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
When you see me with the smile upon my [D7]face
And the sadness of an aching heart you [G]know

When you miss the happiness you'll never [D7]find
Think of me each time the bitter teardrops [G]flow
But you have no mercy on this heart of [D7]mine
And I'm glad that I can say I told you [G]so
