[C]I've been everything that a man shouldn't be

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But I [C]guess that she knows when the bars finally close

But she [G7]stays in the name of [C]love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
She cries in the name of a feelin'

{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
She [C]tries to pretend I won't hurt her again
When [F]Lord knows she's hurt [C]enough

{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}

But I stay every night in the dim red light 
While she [D7]waits all alone for [G7]me
{end_of_verse}
