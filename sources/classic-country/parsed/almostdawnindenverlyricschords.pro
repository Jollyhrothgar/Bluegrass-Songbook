[C]Soon I'll watch the [G7]sun come up in [C]Denver
And again I'll watch the [G7]lonely nights [C]surrender

And your [F]memory [C]abandons me and [G7]finds it's way back [C]home

[G7]Well it's [C]almost dawn in [C7]Denver and I'm [F]almost free
[G7]The sun just crossed the dark side of your [C]memory
I dream of getting [C7]over you is [F]right on time
It's [G7]almost dawn in Denver and you're almost off my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Soon I'll watch those [G7]flashing Denver [C]neon lights
Will this be just [G7]another one of those [C]lonely nights
Of [F]hoping that your [G7]memory won't be [C]wandering in
And [F]wondering if [C]tomorrow I'll be [G7]saying once [C]again 
{end_of_verse}
