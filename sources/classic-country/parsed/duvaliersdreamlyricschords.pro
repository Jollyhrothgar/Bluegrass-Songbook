{meta: title Duvalier's Dream}
{meta: artist Kris Kristofferson}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[Am]Duvalier was a [C]bitter man who [G7]cursed the mornin' sun
[Am]That brought a [E7]new betrayal every [Am]day
He shunned the world of [C]mortals and the [G7]sounds of human tongues
[Am]And blessed the night [G7]that chased their [E7]sight away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
A [Am]disillusioned dreamer who [G7]would never love [Am]again
Who tried a bit and [C]found that it [E7]was rotten
[Am]Preferring perfect [C]strangers to the [G7]company of friends
[Am]Cause strangers are so [E7]easily for[Am]gotten[G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Oh it's [C]hard to keep believin' when you know you've been deceived
To face a lie and dare to try [G7]again
But there's nothin' like a woman with the spell of make believe
To make a new believer of a [Am]man
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Duvalier took the fickle [C]turns of fortune in [G7]his stride
[Am]Expecting next to [E7]nothing out of [Am]life
Till fortune found a [C]girl who fanned the [G7]flame he thought had died
Whose [F]burning [G7]beauty cut him like a [E7]knife
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[Am]She touched him through the senses that his [G7]mind could not [Am]control
Then smiling stepped [C]aside and watched [E7]him fall
[Am]Betrayed by his own [C]body and the hunger in his [G7]soul
[Am]Duvalier was a [E7]dreamer after [Am]all
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Oh it's [C]hard to keep believin' when you know you've been deceived
To face a lie and dare to try [G7]again
But there's nothin' like a woman with the spell of make believe
To make a new believer of a [Am]man
{end_of_verse}
