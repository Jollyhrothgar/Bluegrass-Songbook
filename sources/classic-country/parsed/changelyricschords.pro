{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[Bm]One hand reaches out [G]and pulls a [D7]lost soul from [C]harm
While a [D7]thousand [Em]more go un[C]spoken for
And they say [G]what good have you done by [F]saving just this one
It's like [D7]whispering a prayer in the fury of a storm
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And I [G]hear them say[C]ing you'll never [G]change things
And no [D7]matter what you do it's still the [G]same thing
But it's not the [C]world that I am [Em]chang[C]ing
I [G]do this so this [D7]world will know that it will not [G]change me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[Bm]This heart [C]still believes [G]that love and [D7]mercy still [C]exist
While all the [D7]hatreds [Em]rage and [C]so many say
That [G]love is all but pointless in [F]madness such as this
It's like [D7]tryin' to stop a fire with the moisture from a kiss
{end_of_verse}

I [G]do this so this [D7]world will know that it will not [G]change me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[F]As long as one heart still holds [Em]on then hope is never really [G]gone[D7]

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And I [G]hear them say[C]ing you'll never [G]change things
And no [D7]matter what you do it's still the [G]same thing
