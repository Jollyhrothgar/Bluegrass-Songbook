Don't [C]hide your [G7]face from [C]me

Hold my hand all the [F]way every [G7]hour every [C]day 
From [G7]here to the great [C7][C]unknown

Where [C]no one [G7]stands [C]alone

Like a king I may live in [G7]a palace so [C]tall 
With great riches to call my [G7]own

That's [C]worse than [G7]being [C]alone
