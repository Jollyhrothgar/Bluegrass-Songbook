{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Well a rich man one day heard a [F]poor man a [C]begging
Just [F]crumbs from your [C]table is [D7]all that I [G7]need
But the rich man said [C]no never [F]showing [C]compassion
And [F]Lazarus was [C]broken as he [G7]lay on the [C]street
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And your treasures on earth can't [F]buy you your [C]soul
When [F]your life is [C]over tell [D7]me where can you [G7]go
When your name is [C]called will you [F]pass through that [C]gate
Or [F]will you be like the [C]rich man [G7]when it all fades [C]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now both men did die so the [F]Bible does [C]say
But [F]oh what a [C]change [D7]on that Judgment [G7]Day
While the rich man in [C]flames did [F]lift up his [C]eyes
And [F]Lazarus in [C]Glory he would [G7]now live his [C]life
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Now the rich man he begged from the [F]dark pits of [C]Hell
Oh [F]please just send [C]Lazarus to my [D7]brothers and [G7]tell 
That they may not come [C]here in [F]this torment of [C]flames
I [F]thought I was [C]rich now I [G7]own not a [C]thing
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And your treasures on earth can't [F]buy you your [C]soul
When [F]your life is [C]over tell [D7]me where can you [G7]go
When your name is [C]called will you [F]pass through that [C]gate
Or [F]will you be like the [C]rich man [G7]when it all fades [C]away
