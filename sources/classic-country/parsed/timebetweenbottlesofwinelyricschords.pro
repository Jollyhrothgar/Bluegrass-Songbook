{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]With fire in my veins I [A]laid down to rest
Not [F]carein' if I live or [C]die
Woke up a freezing [A]rain pouring down 
So [F]hard I can't open my [C]eyes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I been [F]chased from the yards with [G7]dogs at my heels
[F]Searchin' for [G7]shelter at [C]times
But there's nothin' so hard for a [A]man on the bum 
As the [C]time between [G7]bottles of [C]wine
The time between [G7]bottles of [C]wine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[D7]Beggin' for pennies for [C]just one taste 
Of the [G7]nectar that kills a mans [D7]soul
Sweet piece of mind [C]excusing my pride
Just [G7]something to keep out the [D7]cold
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
It's too late [G7]for me to start [A7]living again
The [G7]good life is [A7]too far [D7]behind
I never remember the [C]things that I had
Till the [D7]time between [A7]bottles of [D7]wine
The time between [Am]bottles of [D7]wine [G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
If [D7]momma could see me she [C]wouldn't believe
I [G7]even resemble her [D7]son
She worked all her life to [C]make me a man
And she's [G7]proud of the job that she's [D7]done
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
[G7]What one love created [A7]another destroyed
[G7]It’s a story [A7]older than [D7]time
The tale of a man who [C]just can't stand
The [D7]time between [Am]bottles of [D7]wine 
{end_of_verse}

The time between [Am]bottles of [D7]wine 
The time between [Am]bottles of [D7]wine
