{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]The sun comes up and brings the dawn  [G7]as usual
When I awake I'll find you're gone  [C]as usual
But I can't find a way to let this [C7]crazy heart of [F]mine forget
I [G7]pretend you're still beside me  as us[C]ual [G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Each [C]evening I take a walk  [G7]as usual
I make believe that we still talk  [C]as usual
People always [C7]stop and stare I [F]guess they just don't see you there
Don't they [G7]know you'll always be right here  as us[C]ual
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Today I looked into my mirror  [G7]as usual
I told myself that you're still here  as [C]usual
And as I stood there [C7]telling lies the [F]tears began to fill my eyes
Cause I [G7]know I'm only fooling myself  as us[C]ual
{end_of_verse}
