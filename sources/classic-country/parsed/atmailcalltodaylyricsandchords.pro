{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]At mail call today love your last letter [D7]came
I just stood there smiling as they called my [G]name
But as I read it over my [G7]skies turned to [C]grey
[D7]And tears dimmed my eyes dear at mail call [G]today
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I can't understand love what happened to [D7]you
The day that I sailed love you said you'd be [G]true
But now that it's over what [G7]more can I [C]say
[D7]My poor heart was broken at mail call [G]today
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Good luck and God bless you wher[G7]ever you [C]stay
[D7]My world for me ended at mail call [G]today
{end_of_verse}
