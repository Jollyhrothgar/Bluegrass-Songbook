{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I set down my [F]coffee cup and [G7]slowly start to [C]gettin' up
But she stands [F]between me and the [G7]door
[C]Yes it's been a [F]lot of fun but [G7]something tells me [C]I must run
Don't want my big feet [G7]growing to the [C]floor
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I see a tear there [F]in her eye and [G7]I had hoped she [C]wouldn't cry
Thinkin' of the [F]things that might have [G7]been
But [C]something down [F]inside of me [G7]always keeps me [C]running free
I've gotta hang my [G7]hat upon the [C]wind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I've [G7]gotta hang my hat up[F]on the [C]wind
[G7]There's a lotta places [F]I haven't [C]been
There's always something [F]new to find
That [G7]someone dear to [C]leave behind
I've gotta hang my [G7]hat upon the [C]wind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
One quick kiss and [F]then I'm [C]gone                  
[G7]I've been standing [C]here too long
She shakes her head and [F]watches [C]silent[G7]ly
I [C]slip away in[F]to the night I [G7]may be wrong I [C]may be right
But these are some [G7]things that have to [C]be
{end_of_verse}
