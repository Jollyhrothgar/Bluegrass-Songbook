[G]Well I'm just a [G7]bartender
And I [C]don't like my [A7]work
But I [D7]don't mind the money at [G]all
[D7]I've seen [G]lots of sad [G7]faces
And [C]lots of bad [A7]cases
Of [D7]folks with their backs to the [G]wall

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[D7]But I need [G]four walls [G7]around me [C]to hold my [A7]life

And a [G]honky tonk [G7]angel to [C]hold me [A7]tight
To [D7]keep me from slipping [G]away

Well I can light up your [G7]smokes
I can [C]laugh at your [A7]jokes
I can [D7]watch you fall down on your [G]knees
[D7]I can [G]close down this [G7]bar
Oh [C]and gas up my [A7]car
And [D7]I can pack up and mail in my [G]keys

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Now the smoke fills the [G7]air
Of [C]this honky tonk [A7]bar
And I'm [D7]thinking bout where I'd rather [G]be
[D7]But I [G]burned all my [G7]bridges
And [C]I sunk all my [A7]ships
And [D7]I'm standing at the edge of the [G]sea
