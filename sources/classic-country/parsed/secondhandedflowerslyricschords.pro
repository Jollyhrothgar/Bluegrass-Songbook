[C]I was working in Miami [F]for a day or [C]two
[F]I decided [C]I'd look up a girl that I once [G7]knew
[C]I bought some flowers and went to see a [F]girl I used to [C]know
[F]The lady at her [C]door said she had [G7]married long [C]ago

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Times will change and towns will change but [F]there I was [C]alone
[F]When suddenly [C]I wondered would Susie be at [G7]home
[C]So with the flowers in my hand I [F]walked toward her [C]gate
[F]Someone touched me [C]on the arm and [G7]said you'll have to [C]wait
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Then I noticed there were people [F]standing in a [C]line
[F]Some of them were [C]holding pretty flowers just like [G7]mine
[C]They explained that Susie had [F]been in an awful [C]crash
[F]Doctors said that [C]she had just a [G7]little while to [C]last
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
When I walked into her room I [F]felt the sense of [C]shame
[F]But I heard Susie [C]whisper I'm awfully glad you [G7]came
[C]She had been the girl that I had [F]always gone to [C]see
[F]When someone that I [C]cared for [G7]had been untrue to [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I handed her the flowers and she [F]gently kissed my [C]hand
[F]She said don't be [C]embarrassed for you know I under[G7]stand
[C]I said goodbye and as I bent to [F]kiss her fevered [C]brow
[F]I heard her whisper [C]thank you for the [G7]second handed [C]flowers
{end_of_verse}
