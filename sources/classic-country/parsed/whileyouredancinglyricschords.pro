{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]While you're dancing I'll just sit here at this lonely [G7]table
While you're laughing I'll try to force a smile as long as I'm [C]able
While you're clinging to them I'll keep clinging to the past
Getting [F]sicker inside while the lonely minutes pass
Oh the [G7]nights never end too fast while you're [C]dancing
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
While you're dancing for just a moment you're anybody's [G7]baby
You're romancing in your mind or behind my back [C]maybe
In your heart you keep wishing that I would go away
So you could [F]leave with someone else I wasn't born yesterday
Oh I [G7]don't know what to do or say while you're [C]dancing
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
It [F]seems like such a sin you'd make me [C]feel this way
But some[G7]times I wonder if you know what feeling [C]is
I [F]guess I'll always let you make me [Em]feel this way[Am]
And as [D7]long as you let me I'll [G7]stay
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]While you're dancing I'll just keep on a sittin' at this [G7]table
While they're laughin' at me I'll try to take it just as long as I'm [C]able
While you're wandering cross the floor I'll keep wondering deep inside
If I had [F]walked out long ago how much less would I have cried
Oh how [G7]many times have I cried while you're [C]dancing
Oh how [G7]many times have I cried while you're [C]dancing
{end_of_verse}
