{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G7]There're so [C]many things we'd change
If we [F]lived our lives [C]again
So many things we would and we would not [Dm]do  [G7]
All the [C]past mistakes we've made
And the [F]price that we have [C]paid
Oh how we'd live if we [G7]could start [C]anew
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But there's [G7]no going back
And we [F]can't change the [C]past
Or [F]turn back the [C]hands of [Dm]time [G7]
[C]Yesterday is history [F]tomorrow is a mystery
And [C]I know that only this [G7]moment is [C]mine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
There are things we'd never try
And [F]tears we'd never [C]cry
If we have known the hill was far too [Dm]steep[G7]
We'd have [C]never tumbled down
Or [F]fallen in and [C]drown
If we had known the [G7]river was so [C]deep
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But there's [G7]no going back
And we [F]can't change the [C]past
Or [F]turn back the [C]hands of [Dm]time [G7]
[C]Yesterday is history [F]tomorrow is a mystery
And [C]I know that only this [G7]moment is [C]mine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[G7]So it's [C]best if we forget
The [F]things we now [C]regret
For we cannot go back and change the [Dm]past [G7]
Let us [C]use those old mistakes
A [F]better life to [C]make
And tomorrow we may [G7]find that dream at [C]last
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But there's [G7]no going back
And we [F]can't change the [C]past
Or [F]turn back the [C]hands of [Dm]time [G7]
[C]Yesterday is history [F]tomorrow is a mystery
And [C]I know that only this [G7]moment is [C]mine
