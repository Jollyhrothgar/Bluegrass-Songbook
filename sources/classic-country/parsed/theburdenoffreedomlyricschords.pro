[C]I stand on the stairway my back to the [Dm]dungeon

For seekin' sal[Dm]vation [G7]they don't under[C]stand

Lord help me to [F]shoulder the burden of [C]freedom
And give me the [F]courage to be what I [G7]can

Lord help me for[G7]give them they don't under[C]stand
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Their lonely frustration descending to [Dm]laughter
Erases the [G7]footprints I leave in the [C]sand
And I'm free to [Dm]travel [G7]where no one can [C]follow
In search of the [Dm]kingdom [G7]they don't under[C]stand
{end_of_verse}

God help her for[G7]give me I don't under[C]stand
