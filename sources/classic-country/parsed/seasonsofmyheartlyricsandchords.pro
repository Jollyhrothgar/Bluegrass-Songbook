{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]The seasons come the seasons go 
We get a little [G7]sunshine [C]rain and [G]snow
Just the way that it was planned to [D7]be
[G]But there are no seasons in my heart 
While you [G7]play the [C]leading [G]part
And my love for you [D7]will bloom [G]eternally
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
As it is in nature's plan
No [G7]season gets the [C]upper [G]hand 
How I tried to keep this fact in [D7]mind
[G]The trees grow bare the cold wind blows
And by [G7]experience we [C]should [G]know
That winter comes but the [D7]spring is close [G7][G]behind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Your [C]leaving will bring autumn [G]sorrow 
And my tears like withered leaves will [D7]fall
But [C]spring could bring some glad [G]tomorrow 
And darling we could be [D7]happy after [G]all
{end_of_verse}
