We grew up together on the wrong side of the [C]river

And a [G]man to busy to [D7]care

To the [G]room at the top [D7]of the [G]stairs

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Lord [C]he’d never believe that these old worn out [G]jeans 
Have been thrown across his best velvet [D7]chair

As I hide here and wait for him to drive out the [C]gate
Lord my [G]heart is already up [D7]there
And my [G]hands won’t stop shaking at the thought of her [C]aching
In the [G]room at the top [D7]of the [G]stairs
{end_of_verse}
