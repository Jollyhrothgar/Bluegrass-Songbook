{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Your kisses have been tasting like goodbye
But [F]what you said I [G7]felt my heart [C]stop
A [F]hush [G7]fell [C]over my [Am]room
It was so [C]quiet you could [F]hear a [C]teardrop
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I'm too sad for a mockingbird to mock
Oh [F]it's morning [G7]according to the [C]clock
And [F]again I lie [G7]awake and as the [C]dawn slowly [Am]breaks
It's so [C]quiet you can [F]hear a [C]teardrop
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I [G7]couldn't say a word as you [C]walked out the door
But the [D7]silence was broken as a [G7]tear fell to the floor
[F]Even the [G7]drip in the fau[C]cet has [Am]stopped
And it's so [C]quiet you can [F]hear a [C]teardrop
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
It's so quiet you can [F]hear my [C]teardrop
{end_of_verse}
