{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Hear the rain on the window I [C]never noticed it so [G]loud
And the ticking of the clock is making wall shaking [D7]sounds
Was that [G]noise just the icebox or [C]you turning on the [G]light
3:00 AM as a fool tries to [D7]tell himself that you'll be back [G]tonight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Silent night after the [C]fight
Who's wrong or [G]right that don't matter any[D7]more
Silent [G]night after the [C]fight
I can't stand the [G]quiet since [D7]you walked out the [G]door
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I never knew a heartbeat could [C]keep someone so wide [G]awake
And when that board creaks in the hallway 
I can see my mind about to [D7]break
Lying [G]here without you the [C]silence is so loud I can't [G]sleep
But the loudest sounds of all [D7]are the teardrops dripping down my [G]cheek
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Silent night after the [C]fight
Who's wrong or [G]right that don't matter any[D7]more
Silent [G]night after the [C]fight
I can't stand the [G]quiet since [D7]you walked out the [G]door
{end_of_verse}
