{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]You say I shouldn't be here 
It's the [D7]same thing every night
You say I should go home to her 
What we're [G]doing just ain't right
It's true she's there waitin' 
And [G7]wondering there's no [C]doubt
But she's the one you [G]live with 
And you're the [D7]one I can't live with[G]out
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]She's the one you live with 
But you're the one I can't live with[G]out
And [C]she's the one you dream with 
But you're the one I dream [D7]about
They [G]say I'm breaking up your home 
It's not a home it's just a [C]house
She's still the one you [G]live with 
But you're the [D7]one I can't live with[G]out
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
If I knew you only lived there 
And your [D7]love for me was true
But how can I be certain 
You're not [G]makin' me a fool
Surely you must kiss her 
To keep [G7]proof from findin' [C]out
But she's just the one you [G]live with 
But you're the [D7]one I can't live with[G]out
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]She's the one you live with 
But you're the one I can't live with[G]out
And [C]she's the one you dream with 
But you're the one I dream [D7]about
They [G]say I'm breaking up your home 
It's not a home it's just a [C]house
She's still the one you [G]live with 
But you're the [D7]one I can't live with[G]out
