[F]If this house could talk oh what a [C]story 
[G7]Although it's only made of wood and [C]stone

When [G7]it almost became a happy [C]home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I just came back in town [G7]to sign the [C]papers 
[F]The house is sold [G7]now it's no longer [C]mine
[F]And since the place I built for you 
[C]Once meant so much to [F]me
[C]Thought I'd drop by and [G7]see it one more [C]time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I parked the car got [G7]out and looked it [C]over
[F]The unkept lawn now [G7]seems so strange to [C]me
[F]That rambling rose that I'd set out  
[C]With tender care had [F]died
[C]And weeds grow now where [G7]flowers used to [C]be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I walked up close [G7]looked through the picture [C]window
[F]The past was oh so clear [G7]as I looked [C]through
[F]I listened close and almost heard 
[C]Those tender words of [F]love
[C]As I sat by the [G7]fireside with [C]you
