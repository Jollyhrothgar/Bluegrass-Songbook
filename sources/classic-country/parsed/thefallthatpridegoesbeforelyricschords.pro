{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]It's dark and it's cold on the street where I stand
And the [F]pawnshop is closing its [C]door
In the [F]window is the ring you once wore on your [C]hand
So this is the [F]fall that [C]pride goes before[G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [C]said that I'd see you come beg for it back
But you [F]just threw your ring on the [C]floor
It's the [F]last thing I had but the clothes on my [C]back
So this is the [F]fall that [C]pride goes before
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I [G7]stumbled and fell without [C]your hand to hold 
Like a [F]blind man that loses his [C]cane
I [G7]must have a bottle to [C]keep off the cold 
And [D7]pretend I'm not going [G7]insane
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]Tomorrow somebody may give me a dime 
Then I'll [F]keep it till I get three [C]more
And I'll [F]buy me a bottle of forty cent [C]wine 
So this is the [F]fall that [C]pride goes before
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
So this is the [F]fall that [C]pride goes before
{end_of_verse}
