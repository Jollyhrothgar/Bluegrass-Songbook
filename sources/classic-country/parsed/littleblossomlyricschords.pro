{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Oh dear I'm so tired and so [F]lonesome
I [G7]wonder why mommy don't [C]come
She told me to close my blue [F]eyes
And [G7]before I woke up she'd be [C]home 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
She said she was going to see [F]grandma 
Who [G7]lives by the river so [C]wide 
And I guess my mommy's fell in [F]there 
And [G7]perhaps she won't be home [C]tonight 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
So I guess I'll go down and meet [F]daddy 
[G7]Perhaps he has stopped at the [C]store 
It's a great big store full of [F]bottles 
And [G7]I wish he wouldn't go there [C]anymore 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
So out in the night with the [F]baby 
Her [G7]little heart beating with [C]pride 
Till her tired feet entered the gin [F]palace 
With [G7]music all radiant with [C]light 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Oh daddy she cried as she reached [F]him 
I [G7]think that the music's so [C]sweet 
But it's almost supper time [F]daddy 
Little [G7]blossom wants something to [C]eat 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
A moment his blurred eyes gazed [F]wildly 
Down [G7]into her face sweet and [C]fair 
And as the demon possessed [F]him 
He [G7]grasped at the back of a [C]chair 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
A moment a second was [F]over
He [G7]lifted her fair golden [C]head 
A moment the baby's lips [F]trembled
Then [G7]poor little blossom was [C]dead 
{end_of_verse}
