{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I watched her pack her worn out [C]suitcase
Like so many times [G]before
Her voice still echoes down the [A7]hallway
I won’t be coming back no [D7]more

[G]Five nights a week I kept her [C]happy
We lived in perfect [G]harmony
But our trouble starts on [D7]Friday
That feeling takes control of [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
It’s that Friday night [D7]feeling
That I can’t seem to [G]control
Pretty ladies and sweet [A7]music
It’s down deep in my [D7]soul
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[G]And this feeling won’t leave [C]me
Till Sunday morning [G]comes
Oh this Friday night [D7]feeling
It won’t let me go [G]home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I just stopped in to cash my [C]paycheck
Thought I drink one then go [G]home
Then I saw that good looking [A7]lady
Setting at the bar [D7]alone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
[G]Well she had that look of needing [C]someone
Felt that feeling coming on [G]strong
Oh this Friday night [D7]feeling
Just won’t let me go [G]home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}

[G]And this feeling won’t leave [C]me
Till Sunday morning [G]comes
Oh this Friday night [D7]feeling
It won’t let me go [G]home
