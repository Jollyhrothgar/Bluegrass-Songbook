{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]My soul was bowed in sorrow
And my [F]heart cried out in [C]pain
And the clouds they gathered [Am]round me
And it [D7]seemed all help was [G7]vain
Un[C]til I thought of Jesus and [F]I began to [C]pray
Then His sunlight broke up[Am]on me
And He [D7]pointed [G7]out the [C]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
My soul walked through the darkness 
Into the [G7]light of [C]day
My soul walked though the [Am]darkness
When [D7]I began to [G7]pray
Then the [C]dawn of God's great love
Shed its light upon my [Am]way
And my [C]soul walked through the [Am]darkness
When [D7]I be[G7]gan to [C]pray[F]  [C]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
So hear me my fellow pilgrims
As you [F]journey on your [C]way
In all your trials and [Am]troubles
Well [D7]don't forget to [G7]pray
Just [C]turn your heart to Jesus and [F]let His sunshine [C]in
He will take your heavy [Am]burden
And re[D7]lieve your [G7]heart from [C]sin
