{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I'm living in a crazy dream I [F]know it can't be real
[G7]Everything has changed and now my broken heart is [C]healed
You're loving me like I love you at [F]least that's how it seems
But I [G7]know this can't be more than [F]just a [G7]crazy [C]dream
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G7]Fate has played a hand and every[F]thing has turned [C]around
You've [G7]given up your reckless past and [D7]finally settled [G7]down
They [C]say that dreams can't last for long [F]they have to end it seems
But I [G7]pray I'll never wake up from this [F]crazy [G7]crazy [C]dream
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
If this is just a crazy dream I'll [F]wake and you'll be gone
[G7]You'll be back in your world and I'll be all a[C]lone
I wish I could find a way to make this [F]crazy dream come true
Cause I [G7]know that I will always be [F]crazy [G7]over [C]you
