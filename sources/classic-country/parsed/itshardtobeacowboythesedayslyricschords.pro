{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Today I act like a kid in my pickup truck
I [D7]wonder if I'll ever grow up
I [F]shouldn't do the things I do I oughta act my [G7]age
I'm [C]running lose every night on the town
[D7]Everybody wants me to settle down
It's [F]hard to be a [G7]cowboy these [C]days
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I wear boots and jeans not suits and ties
I don't [D7]make much money but I get by
I don't [F]start no trouble but don't get in my [G7]way
I wanna [C]drink my beer where I can wear my hat
[D7]Country clubs it ain't where it's at
It's [F]hard to be a [G7]cowboy these [C]days
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well I [F]don't feel at home and fancy places
[Em]I prefer the wide open spaces
[F]I need a gal who understands that kind of [G7]man
I don't [F]think that I'm a bit old fashioned
[Em]No better way for the time to pass 
Than [F]be out there with a damn good country [G7]band
I'll [C]proudly lay back and let the world go by
But the [D7]cost of living is getting to high
Oh it's [F]hard to be a [G7]cowboy these [C]days
