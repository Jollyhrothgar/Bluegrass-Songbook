[C]I drank fifteen beers that's a [F]whole lot of brew in one [C]night
When you try to drown a memory from your [G7]mind
It took me [C]fifteen beers to get here 
I don't [F]know how many more till I leave
Take my [C]change in tears and [G7]drink fifteen [C]beers [F]   [C]

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Well I rolled into Joe's about six-fifteen 
And I was [F]ready to pour 'em down
Because at [C]eight o'clock Delilah was a-meeting me [G7]there
Well I thought I'd [C]have me a pour just to loosen up 
Cause we were [F]really gonna swing tonight
I could [C]already see her face and [G7]touch her long red [C]hair [F]   [C]

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well at nine thirty-five I thought man a live 
[F]What could be a-holding her up
Just then a [C]man in a long black Cadillac came in 
And told [G7]little Joe filler up
While he was [C]cleaning off the windows and guess who he saw 
In the [F]back laying soft as rain
It was [C]Delilah  [G7]sipping on pink [C]champagne
{end_of_verse}

I drank fifteen beers that's a [F]whole lot of brew for one [C]man
When you try to drown a memory from your [G7]mind
It took me [C]fifteen beers to forget you 
I don't [F]know how many more to just get
While he holds [C]Delilah near [G7]I'll drink my fifteen [C]beers
