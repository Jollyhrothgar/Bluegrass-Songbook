{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I'd love to hear a [D7]jukebox [G]play
I love you a [C]thousand [G]ways
Or if [C]you've got the [G]money I've got the [D7]time
I'd walk a [G]mile for [D7]Mom and [G]Dad
And the good times [C]that we [G]had
Look what [C]thoughts will do
When you [G]sing old [D7]pal of [G]mine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But the [D7]old old man is gone
There'll be [C]no more Lefty [G]songs
How [C]much he meant to [G]me nobody [D7]knows
The long black [G]veil that [D7]Alice [G]wore
Like words he sang some [C]years be[G]fore
[C]She loved him [G]too   [D7]that's the way love [G]goes
{end_of_verse}
