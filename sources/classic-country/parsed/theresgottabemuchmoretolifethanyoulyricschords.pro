{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I was born long [F]before I ever [C]met you
But I [G7]never lived [F]until you [G7]came a[C]long
If you left me now I [F]never could for[C]get you
And [G7]I don't know if I could go [C]on [C7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Cause there's [F]gotta be much more to life than [C]you
Though [G7]I don't know just what more there can [C]be [C7]
Cause how [F]can there be much more to life than [C]you
When [G7]you are more than [F]life [G7]itself to [C]me [G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
When I'm [C]alone I [F]see your face be[C]fore me
You're [G7]on my mind no [F]matter [G7]what I [C]do
You've made the world a [F]thing of wonder [C]for me
And I'd [G7]hate to think of [F]livin' [G7]without [C]you [C7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Still there's [F]gotta be much more to life than [C]you
Though [G7]I don't know just what more there can [C]be [C7]
Cause how [F]can there be much more to life than [C]you
When [G7]you are more than [F]life [G7]itself to [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
When [G7]you are more than [F]life [G7]itself to [C]me
{end_of_verse}
