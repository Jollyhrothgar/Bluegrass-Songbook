{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]He was tougher than leather and he didn't [G7]care
[C]Whether the sun shined or not
[D7]When a young kid in Cow Town wanted a showdown
[G]He was careless or just maybe forgot
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But he died in the gunfight blinded by sunlight
[G7]Never draw when you're facing the [C]sun
[D7]And old tougher than leather
[G]Just carved one more notch on his gun
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[D7]And when he turned to go the beautiful maiden knelt down
[G]Where her dead sweetheart lay
[A7]And on his breast placed a rose
[D7]While the townspeople stared in dismay
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[G]And old tougher than leather should've known better
[D7]But he picked up the rose in his hand
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
And the townspeople froze when his hands crushed the rose
[G]And the rose petals fell in the sand
{end_of_verse}

And old tougher than leather was a full-time go-getter
[D7]The grass never grew beneath his feet

From one town to another he would ride like the wind
[G]But his mind kept going back to the street
{end_of_verse}

Where a young cowboy died and a young maiden cried
[D7]And rose petals fell in the sand
{end_of_verse}

And his heart had been softened by the beautiful maid
[G]And he knew he must see her again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 10}
Well he went back to the town where it all had come down
[D7]And he searched but his search was in vain
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 11}
He had wanted to find her and say he was sorry
[G]For causing her heart so much pain

But one night he died from a poison inside
[D7]Brought on by the wrong he had done
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 13}
And old tougher than leather
[G]Had carved his last notch on his gun

Well he was buried in Cow Town along about sundown
[D7]Looking good in his new store-bought clothes
{end_of_verse}

When the young maiden came over and knelt down beside him
[G]And on his lapel placed a rose

[G]Flying high flying high
[D7]To a place from a place
[G]Changing skies changing skies
