{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]There's a big storm rollin' in I can [F]feel it in my bones
I'll [G7]bet my pay they'll run tonight but I'm praying that they [C]don't
See the lightnin' flashin' out [F]on the distant plains
The [G7]wind sweeps cross my bedroll and the air smells just like [C]rain
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
So I'm sleepin' in my leggin's [F]tonight
My [G7]night horse is tied by my [C]side
When lightnin' cracks and thunder rolls my [F]mouth gets hot and dry
So I'm [G7]sleepin' in my leggin's [C]tonight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Reminds me of a stormy night on the [F]Brazos late last spring
They'd [G7]settled on the bed ground when it began to [C]rain
Mighty bolt of lightn' struck the [F]ground and they were gone
Three [G7]thousand head of longhorns running madly in the [C]storm

Little Jimmy Wilson tryin' [F]hard to turn the lead
Was the [G7]first to reach the cattle and got caught in the [C]stampede
When the lightnin' flashed I saw him as his [F]saddle horse went down
He's [G7]sleeps beside the Chisholm trail beneath a sagebrush covered [C]mound

[F]Sight of rushin' [G7]cattle can [F]drive a man [C]insane
Longhorns [F]glowing in the [G7]darkness the [F]wind the hail the [G7]rain
I'm sleepin' in my leggin's [C]tonight
