{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]If sometimes I hurt you sayin' things that I don't mean
It's because I love you so darn much but you know somehow it [C7]seems
When you're [F]hurt and angry words are spoken love sounds like hate
But the [G7]more you love the more you hurt and it's always been that way
There's too much love between us to let love get in our [C]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
It doesn't really matter who hurts first or who's at fault
But we mustn't use up all the love of stones to build a [C7]wall
That might not [F]stand up to the pressure when the final stone is laid
Then the [G7]tumbling kills tomorrows and we had dreams of yesterday
There's too much love between us to get love get in our [C]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
You've [G7]become too much a part of me there's just too much of me in you
And [F]we can't see the forest for the [C]trees
But you [G7]know if I took me from you and you took you away from me
There's be [F]nothing left of you and even less of [G7]me
We’ve got too much love between us to get love get in our [C]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
When you're [F]hurt and angry words are spoken love sounds like hate
But the [G7]more you love the more you hurt and it's always been that way
There's too much love between us to let love get in our [C]way
{end_of_verse}
