{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I've lived enough to know that love's not everything you [C]need
[D7]And God knows I know there’s still so many [C]things you want to [G]be
[G7]I've seen enough to understand the pain you're going [C]through
[D7]It's just a shame to know I'm not enough for [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]It hurts to see the hurt beneath your laughter and your lies
[D7]And try in vain to free the painful secret [C]locked behind your [G]eyes
[G7]And I can't even blame you for the things you're turning [C]to
[D7]It's just a shame to know I'm not enough for [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[B7]I've given you the best of everything [C]I had to [G]give
[A7]And now there's nothing left for me to leave you but my will to [D7]live
[G]I hope some day somebody [G7]somewhere loves you like I [C]do
[D7]It's just a shame to know I'm not enough for [G]you
[D7]It's just a shame to know I'm not enough for [G]you
{end_of_verse}
