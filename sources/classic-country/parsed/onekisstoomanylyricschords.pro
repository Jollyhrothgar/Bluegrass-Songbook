[G]I had one kiss too many and it [G7]went right to my [C]heart
What a [D7]fool I was to fall in love with [G]you
[D7]I had one [G]kiss too many should [G7]have known from the [C]start
I was [D7]kissing someone who just couldn't [G]be [G7]true
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [C]knew the morning after I [G]made a big [G][C]mistake
That [A7]extra kiss was more than this old heart of mine to [D7]take
I had one [G]kiss too many I remember [G7]it and I [C]cry
Cause when [D7]I kissed you I kissed my heart [G]goodbye
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I had one kiss too many and it [G7]took me by [C]surprise
Now I [D7]know I'll never ever be the [G]same
[D7]I had one [G]kiss too many sure [G7]I'd never close my [C]eyes
Cause I [D7]know that you were only playing a [G]game
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I [C]should have been contented to [G]take a [C]kiss and [G]run
I [A7]had to hang around until I got that fatal [D7]one
I had one [G]kiss too many it was [G7]just too much for [C]me
Oh but [D7]one kiss less my heart might still be [G]free
{end_of_verse}
