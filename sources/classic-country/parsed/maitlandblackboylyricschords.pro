{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]In Maitland’s busy High Street all dressed in red and [G7]blue
[C]The city’s famous black boy is there for all to view
[C7]He stood there by the roadside a hundred years or [F]so
[C]Reminding passing people [G7]of the days of long [C]ago
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]He’s held the reigns of horses while their owners were [C]away
[F]And taken care of sulkies and the [C]local farmer’s [G7]dray
[C]Although the horse and sulky days [C7]will never come [F]again
[C]He stands with hand [G7]extended to take a rider’s [C]rein
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G7]He’s watched man’s steady progress through said seeing eyes
[C]And seen a little country town into a city rise
[C7]If only he could speak to us of Maitland’s early [F]life
[C]He’d tell of all the [G7]pleasures the troubles and the [C]strife
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[F]When drought came on the valley he stood through searing [C]heat
[F]His painted shirt and trousers all [C]crumbled round his [G7]feet
[C]But when the drought had broken and the [C7]good times came in [F]view
[C]A coat of paint and there [G7]he stood dressed up as good as [C]new
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[G7]He shared the people’s heartaches that come with raging flood
[C]And stood as water raced on by all stained with yellow mud
[C7]He’s seen this happen many times throughout these hundred [F]years
[C]And joined the sadden [G7]people by shedding rusty [C]tears
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
[G7]I don’t reside in Maitland so you’ll ponder for a time
[C]Just what it was that caused me to pen this little rhyme
[C7]I really can’t explain it it’s oh so hard to [F]do
[C]But I love that little [G7]fella every bit as much as [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
[F]I know he has no beating heart within his iron [C]frame
[F]And he’s just a little statue [C]but there’s no given [G7]name
[C]But treat him as you would a child and [C7]not as something [F]caste
[C]And let him stand in memory [G7]or your town’s historic [C]past
{end_of_verse}
