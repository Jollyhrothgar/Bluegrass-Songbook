{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]There's not much to do when you're travelin' through Eldo[D7]rado
That's what the old preacher's daughter was saying one [G]day
She was a lady and I was a mean despe[D7]rado
I stole her gold and her heart and we both stole [G]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
When we are wed I'll be gentle I said to [D7]Maria
Gentle and tender when you surrender to [G]me
But to my surprise she was wise in the ways of [D7]amore
As wise and as wicked and wild as a woman can [G]be [D7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Oh [G]Maria let me sleep a little [D7]longer
I don't think I can face all that satin and lace one more [G]night
Well maybe I could and I would if I were a little [D7]younger
But please let me rest for a while and then I'll be all [G]right
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I'm losing weight but Maria looks greater than [D7]ever
Oh I'm such a wreck from my reckless affection and [G]pride
I'll drown in the love that I've found in the arms of [D7]Maria
I need a rest a siesta or surely I'll [G]die
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Oh [G]Maria let me sleep a little [D7]longer
I don't think I can face all that satin and lace one more [G]night
Well maybe I could and I would if I were a little [D7]younger
But please let me rest for a while and then I'll be all [G]right
{end_of_verse}
