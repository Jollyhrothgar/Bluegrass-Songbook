[C]Your daddy caught us [F]at the old sawmill [C]depot
But how in the hell did he [G7]know 
I was down there with [C]you [G7]
That old hot spring [C]depot 
[F]Has long since been [C]closed
Through broken [G7]windows (through broken windows)
He saw I love [C]you (he saw I love you)
Through broken [G7]windows he saw I love [C]you[F]   [C]

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And the [F]rich man from West Hampton Arkansas
Got him a [C]son-in-law
One wearing [G7]overalls and in the hock for a [C]chainsaw
And [F]he said that a poor boy from the Ozarks
Would never get too [C]far 
Smelling like [G7]tree bark
And loadin' up [C]black cars [F]  [C]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well I worked like hell so [F]I could buy that ol' [C]depot
That I hammered and [G7]sawed on my dream after [C]dark [G7]
Now all of the [C]best folks [F]come down to the [C]depot
For it's the finest [G7]steak house in all of the [C]Ozarks
And they came from as [G7]far off as West Hampton [C]Arkansas
