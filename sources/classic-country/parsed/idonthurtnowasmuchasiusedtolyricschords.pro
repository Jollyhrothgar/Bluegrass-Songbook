{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I don’t hurt now as much as I [C]used to
I guess I’m [G]gettin’ used to [C]livin’ without [G]you
When you left me I swore I’d never [C]love again
I was [G]sure no one could measure up to [D7]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Now I [G]know I only saw you through the [C]eyes of love
And I was [G]just too blind to [C]see you be un[G]true
I don’t hurt now as much as I [C]used to
I guess I’m [G]gettin’ used to [C]livin’ without [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
With your new love you passed walking [C]arm in arm
And you [G]smiled at him the way you smiled at [D7]me
But the [G]same old eyes of love can now see [C]everything
And the [G]heart you made a [C]prisoner now is [G]free
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I don’t hurt now as much as I [C]used to
I guess I’m [G]gettin’ used to [C]livin’ without [G]you
{end_of_verse}
