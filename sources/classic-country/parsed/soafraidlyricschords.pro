{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Looking in your eyes and finding only a reflection there of [D7]me
Many questions long unanswered many doubts what go on botherin' [G]me
If I were on the other side where [G7]little tender feelin's 
Run and [C]hide away from [A7]me 
[D7]Would I find love embedded there would I know 
Then that I'm a fool to [G]be
So [C]afraid (so [D7]afraid) so [G]afraid (so afraid) so [C]afraid of [D7]losing [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Is love to you a melody you only wish to share with me [D7]today
And not an ever lastin' thing a song we sing that time can take [G]away
Your love is such a precious [G7]thing 
The thought of losing you can bring such [C]fear to m-[A7]e
If [D7]I could be behind your eyes then I might realize I'm wrong to [G]be
So [C]afraid (so [D7]afraid) so [G]afraid (so afraid) so [C]afraid of [D7]losing [G]you
{end_of_verse}
