{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I've lost the only love I've ever [F]known
Too [G7]many nights I left her all [C]alone
I said forgive me one too many [F]times
And [G7]now her parting words have slipped my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You're with the Wrong Company they'll drag you [F]down
You're spending too much [G7]time on the wrong side of [C]town
Now it's your life to live but it's my heart to [F]give
And if you [G7]still want me give up that wrong [C]company
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
She warned me but I've wasted my last [F]chance
And [G7]now she's gone without a backward [C]glance
Oh how I miss the love I threw [F]away
Every [G7]song on that jukebox seems to [C]say
