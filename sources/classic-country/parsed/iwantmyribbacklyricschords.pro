{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Now the bible tells the story about Adam's rib
How the [C]Lord made a woman for companionship
And the [G]first thing she did was take a [D7]bite of that forbidden [G]fruit
Well I guess we'll be paying till the end of time
At [C]least that's how it is with that woman of mine
Oh [G]Lord I [D7]think I want my rib [G]back
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]Now this is wrong and baby that ain't right
And I'm [G]huggin' tryin' to please that woman day and night
She's [C]never satisfied although I try to do the best that I [D7]can
[G]Somethings gotta change honey I'm gonna leave
I [C]won't let evolution gonna make a monkey out of me
Oh [G]Lord I [D7]think I want my rib [G]back
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
There's been a hole in wallet and a pain in my side
Ever [C]since I made that girl my blushing bride
Her [G]daddy calls her angel and her [D7]momma calls her three times a [G]night
Her cousins on the sofa her sister's got my car
Her [C]brother's drink my liquor like my house was a bar
Oh [G]Lord I [D7]think I want my rib [G]back
