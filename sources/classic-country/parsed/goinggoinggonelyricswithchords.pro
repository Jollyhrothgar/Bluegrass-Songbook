{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]It's over  [F]I left the door [C]unlocked again
[F]But this time some[Em]one new walked in
[F]While she was all [A#7]alone[G7]
He [C]told her  [F]that there was much [C]more to life to see
[F]Than she would ever [Em]see with me[Dm]
Now she's [G7]going going [C]gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
It's over  [F]I never thought I'd [C]see this day
[F]When everything would [Em]walk away
[F]That I depended [A#7]on  [G7]God he'll hold [C]her
[F]To make sure she don't [C]change her mind
[F]I've lost her all the [Em]way this time[Dm]
She's [G7]going going [C]gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]I should have paid [Am]attention there were [Dm]many warning [F]signs
But [G7]I just never [A#7]thought she'd [A7]walk away
Now [Dm]here I stand in silence just an echo 
Of the [G7]words I heard her [A#7]say [G7]
She said it's [C]over [F]  and much too late to [C]change her mind
[F]I've lost her all the [Em]way this time[Dm]
She's [G7]going going [C]gone
{end_of_verse}
