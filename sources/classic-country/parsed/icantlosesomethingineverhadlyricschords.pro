{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I said I'd forget you 
That's what I'm trying to [F]do
But instead of [G7]forgetting 
I'm falling more in love with [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But I try to keep thinking 
Is it really so [F]bad
For I can't lose [C]something 
[G7]That I've never [C]had
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And now I know you never [F]loved me 
Oh that's what makes me feel so [C]sad
If I could think that you once [D7]loved me 
I know I wouldn't hurt so [G7]bad
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I should be happy that it's [C]over 
To see you go should make me [F]glad
For I can't lose [C]something 
[G7]That I've never [C]had
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}

{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
I should be happy that it's [C]over 
To see you go should make me [F]glad
For I can't lose [C]something 
[G7]That I've never [C]had
