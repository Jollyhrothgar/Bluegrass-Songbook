{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Tonight I hold the one I love far [F]from the one at [C]home
[G7]I picked her up some time ago and I never feel alone
[F]I held on tight too many years to [C]ever set her [F]free
[C]And though she's [F]not [C]a lady she still [G7]means the world to [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]She's no lady but I love her she's been known to be [C]untrue
[G7]She's been knocked around and picked on even dropped a time or [C]two
[F]She's been passed around at parties sat on [C]everybody's [Am]knees
[C]This old guitar's changed hands [F]a time or [C]two
[G7]But it still belongs [F]to me it still belongs to [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]She's the one who keeps me from my wife and family half the [C]time
[G7]She haunts me and she drives me to these honky tonk dives
[F]I pick her up each evening as the [C]neon starts to [F]glow
[C]And hold her closer [F]to my [C]heart than [G7]any lady's ever [C]known
