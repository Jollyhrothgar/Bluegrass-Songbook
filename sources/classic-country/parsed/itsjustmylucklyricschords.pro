{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]It's just my [D7]luck to live when I'd much [G]rather die
I'd end [D7]my life but I don't have t[G]he nerve to try
You're not [C]worth the salt in each new [G]tear I cry
And it's just my luck to [D7]love someone like [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
It's just my [D7]luck to find I gave my [G]heart away
To a man who [D7]has no heart and treats me [G]any ole way
My first [C]bad luck came when I was [G]born one day
And it's just my luck to [D7]love someone like [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Time after [C]time this heart of [D7]mine you went and [G]broke
Till [C]love to me has come to be [A7]just a standing [D7]joke
[G]You're not [C]worth the salt in each new [G]tear I cry
And it's just my luck to [D7]love someone like [C]you till I [G]die
{end_of_verse}
