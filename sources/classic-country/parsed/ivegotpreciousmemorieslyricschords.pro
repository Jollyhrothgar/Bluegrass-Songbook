{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I was walkin' home from [C]work last night
And I got so tired and [G]thirsty
The fool inside of me said stop one drink's al[D7]right
Then I [G]walked into a [C]barroom 
And that's where I met temp[G]tation
Though I fought to keep control of me 
Temp[D7]tation won the [G]fight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Now I've got precious memories 
They're [C]all I've got to [G]cling to
Precious memories are all I've got to [D7]hold
I've [G]got memories of a sweet wife 
And [C]memories of a [G]good life
That was just before temptation 
Told my [D7]sweet wife all she [G]knows
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
She had long black hair and [C]eyes as blue as [G]heaven
And the dress she wore fit her much too [D7]tight
And that's [G]when passion [C]called me and I [G]answered
And though I fought to keep control of me 
Temp[D7]tation won the [G]fight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Now I've got precious memories 
They're [C]all I've got to [G]cling to
Precious memories are all I've got to [D7]hold
I've [G]got memories of a sweet wife 
And [C]memories of a [G]good life
That was just before temptation 
Told my [D7]sweet wife all she [C]know[G]s
