{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]My woman always talked about the [F]New York City life
[G7]She never really wanted to be a country boy's [C]wife
Opening nights on Broadway were [F]always on her mind
[G7]She couldn't seem to live without what she called the New York [C]Times
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I walked in from work one day and [F]didn't find her home
But [G7]I didn't have to wonder long figured where she'd [C]gone
Love was all I had to give so [F]she left me behind
To [G7]go up there somewhere lookin' for the New York T[C]imes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Hey [F]New York City won't you have a little pity 
On this [C]poor Texas country boy
[G7]Somewhere around your big apple town I've lost my pride and [C]joy
I've [F]walked up and down every street around 
Till I [C]think I'm goin' out of my mind
If [G7]I don't find my baby today I'll run an ad in the New York [C]Times
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I've been down 5th Avenue even [F]up old Broadway
And [G7]I searched all the honky tonks like the Lone Star [C]Cafe
Lord I wish I could give her up and [F]erase her from my heart
But [G7]here I stand a broken man in the middle of Central [C]Park
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I walked in from work one day and [F]didn't find her home
But [G7]I didn't have to wonder long figured where she'd [C]gone
Love was all I had to give so [F]she left me behind
To [G7]go up there somewhere lookin' for the New York T[C]imes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Well if [G7]I don't find my baby today I'll run an ad in the New York [C]Times
{end_of_verse}
