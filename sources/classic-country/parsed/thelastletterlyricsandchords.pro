{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Why do you treat me as if I were only a [G7]friend
What have I done that's made you so different and [C]cold
Sometimes I wonder if you'll be [C7]contented [F]again
[G7]Or will you be happy when you are withered and [C]old
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I cannot offer you diamonds and mansions so [G7]fine
And I cannot offer you clothes that your young body [C]craves
But if you'll say that you long to [C7]forever be [F]mine
[G7]Just think of the heartaches the tears and the sorrow you'll [C]save
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
When you are weary and tired of another man's [G7]gold
And when you get lonely remember this letter my [C]own
But don't try to answer though I've suffered anguish [F][C7]untold
[G7]If you don't love me then why don't you leave me [C]alone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
As I am writing this letter I think of the [G7]past
And of the promises that you are breaking so [C]free
But to this old world I'll soon say my [C7]farewell at [F]last
[G7]I will be gone when you read this last letter from [C]me
{end_of_verse}
