{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Just a broken down cowboy all [F]down on his [C]luck
He's [F]been through the best of his [C]friends[G7]
On a [C]long lonesome highway in an [F]ol' pickup [C]truck
Cross [F]Texas with a [G7]hot dusty [C]wind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
He was all around cowboy [F]195[C]9
From the [F]top it's been a long way [C]down [G7]
Since the [C]whiskey and ladies started [F]winnin' his [C]time
They rode him [F]high and [G7]hard to the [C]ground
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
But he [F]remembers the thrill of bein' a [C]winner
And the feeling of bein' a [G7]beginner 
In the days of his first [C]rode[Dm]o  [C]
But there was [F]somethin' about winnin' that didn't last [C]forever
But tomorrow it's bound to get [G7]better
He'll be the all around cowboy [C]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
The windmills are turnin' on the [F]west Texas [C]plains
But he's [F]dry as an ol' river [C]bed [G7]
He's [C]just like the dust that's a [F]searchin' for [C]rain
But he [F]knows he'll [G7]be ridin' [C]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
So he rolls up a smoke and he [F]sips his Old [C]Crow
Wipes the [F]whiskers that cover his [C]chin[G7]
He [C]grins as he dreams of the [F]next rod[C]eo
To be the [F]all around [G7]cowboy [C]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
But he [F]remembers the thrill of bein' a [C]winner
And the feeling of bein' a [G7]beginner 
In the days of his first [C]rode[Dm]o  [C]
But there was [F]somethin' about winnin' that didn't last [C]forever
But tomorrow it's bound to get [G7]better
He'll be the all around cowboy [C]again
