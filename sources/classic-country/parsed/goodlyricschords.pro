{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I was a waitress in a barroom [G7]no future in [C]sight
And he was just [G]lonely when [A7]he came there that [D7]night
[G]Then someone played the jukebox and [G7]he asked me to [C]dance
And when he softly [G]held me [D7]I thought it's my [G7]chance
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
To be [C]good like I want to be [F]that's what he's saw in me
[C]Not just a girl on the [D7]wrong side of [G7]town
[C]Good like I used to be [F]he brought it out in me
And [C]that's when I promised that [G7]I'd never let him [C]down
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G]Now I'm back here in a barroom [G7]a waitress [C]again
The good world I've [G]lived in [A7]just came to an [D7]end
[G]For temptation comes easy to [G7]a woman like [C]me
And regardless of my [G]chances I [D7]know that I'll [G7]never be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]Good like I used to be I [F]guess it's just not in me
[C]With all my heart [D7]how I wish I [G7]could have been
[C]Good like he wanted me but [F]good is what I'll never be
And [C]now I know that [G7]he's gone for [C]good
{end_of_verse}
