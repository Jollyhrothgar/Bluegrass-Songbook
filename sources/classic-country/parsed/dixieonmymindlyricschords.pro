Dixie On My Mind 
by Hank Williams Jr. 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]All the stations up here they don't sign off with [F]Dixie 
The [C]way they did in sweet home Ala[G7]bam 
And [C]the people here don't sip Jack Daniels [F]whiskey 
The [C]way they do in the [G7]Tennessee mountain [C]land 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I've always heard a lot about the Big [F]Apple 
So [C]I thought I'd come up here and [G7]see 
But [C]all I've seen so far is one big [F]hassle 
Wish [C]I was camped out [G7]on the Okeecho[C]bee 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
If [F]this is the promise land I've [C]had all I can stand 
And I'm heading back below that Dixie [G7]line 
No I [F]just don't fit in and I'll [C]never come back again 
But I'm busted here and [F]I got Dixie on my [C]mind 
Oh I'm stuck up here and [F]I got Dixie on my [C]mind 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
These people never smile or say a [F]word 
They're [C]all to busy trying to make an extra [G7]dime 
Oh I'd [C]love to haul them all down around Spartan[F]burg 
And [C]show 'em how to raise [G7]hell in Caro[C]line 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Oh the things you know that I miss most of [F]all 
Is the [C]freedom of the rivers and the [G7]pines 
They [C]don't do much hunting and fishing up here you [F]know 
But I [C]have met a few squirrels [G7]and one por[C]cupine 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Well [F]if this is the promise land I've [C]had all I can stand 
Wish I was down in Houston town to[G7]night
Now I [F]just don't fit in and I'll [C]never be back again
But I'm busted here and [F]I got Dixie on my [C]mind
Lord I'm stuck up here and [F]I got Dixie on my [C]mind 
{end_of_verse}
