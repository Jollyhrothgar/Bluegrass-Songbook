[C]On one hand I count the reasons I could [F]stay with you

But on the [F]other hand there's a golden [C]band

[G7]But the reason I must go is on the other [C]hand

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
In your arms I feel the passion I [F]thought had died
[C]When I looked into your eyes I [G7]found myself

I've got [D7]to hand it to you girl you're [G7]something else
