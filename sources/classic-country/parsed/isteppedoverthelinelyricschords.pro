{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]You threw the roses that I [C]brought you on the [G]floor
[D7]The tear drops burned as I walked out the [G]door
[G7]Then came the anger then the stranger then the [C]wine
[G]That was the first [D7]time I stepped over the [G]line
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]Living together yet a million miles [G]apart
[D7]My conscience hurt  but not as much as my [G]heart
[G7]Always searching just for someone who'd be [C]kind
[G]Over and [D7]over  I stepped over the [G]line
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[D7]Then one night I found an angel
[C]And I knew at last my heartaches were [G]through
[D7]And that's the night I made my mind up
[A7]To say good-bye forever  to [D7]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[G]My joy grows deeper with my [C]new love day by [G]day
[D7]That other world seems so far far [G]away
[G7]The night I found her I found contentment and peace of [C]mind
[G]And that's the last [D7]time I stepped over the [G]line
{end_of_verse}
