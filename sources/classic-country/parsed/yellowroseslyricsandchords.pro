[C]Hello you said the day we [C7]met handing [F]me a yellow rose
You [G7]asked me out and to your surprise and to [F]mine I said I'd [C]go

Though we'd only met I [C]still said yes to a [G7]single yellow [C]rose

And for years to come you were the [C7]one to [F]sleep with me at night
To [G7]laugh and talk and share my thoughts and [F]hold me when I'd [C]cry
And on every rare occasion [C7]and for [F]no good reason to
A big bouquet or a [C]single yellow [G7]rose was sent from [C]you

You said goodbye like you [C]said hello with [G7]a single yellow [C]rose
