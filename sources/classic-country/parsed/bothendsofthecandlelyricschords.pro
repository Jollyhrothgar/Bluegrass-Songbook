{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I've been trying so hard [D7]to forget [G]you
[D7]But this chore of forgetting I [G]find
[C]Has me burning both ends of the [G]candle
[D7]And fighting a battle with [G]time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[D7]What I'd give just to sleep for a [G]moment
[D7]But it's a luxury that I can't [G]afford
[C]For I know that I just dream about [G]you
[D7]And my tears start falling once [G]more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]So I'm burning both ends of the [G]candle
[D7]I just hope that it lasts through the [G]night
[C]For each moment the candle is [G]burning
[D7]Brings closer the ending of [G]life
{end_of_verse}
