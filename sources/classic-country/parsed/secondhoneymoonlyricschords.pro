{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I walked up to the desk and asked the [F]man about a [C]room
I [G7]asked about the bridle sweet I [C]told him I'm the groom
Then I [G7]took the elevator to the [C]floor I was assign
I [G7]fumbled with the key the way I [C]did that other time
[F]Inside I thought of all the things that [C]started in this room
But I'm [F]alone on our [G7]second honey[C]moon
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [G7]hear the happy people laughing [C]in the street below
But the [G7]loneliness I feel tonight [C]I hope you never know
The [F]life that wasn't happy song has [C]ended much too soon
I'm [F]alone on our [G7]second honey[C]moon
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I look around the room and see you [F]standing every[C]where
The [G7]fragrance from your bridle flower [C]seem to fill the air
The [G7]blushing bride that gave me such a [C]free and eager kiss
Two [G7]loving arms around me as you [C]offered wedded bliss
We [F]said that we'd return to live it [C]over in this room
But I'm [F]alone on our [G7]second honey[C]moon
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
([F]Alone on our [G7]second honey[C]moon)
