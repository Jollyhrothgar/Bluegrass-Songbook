{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]We've gone as far together as [F]love will let us [C]go
There's been lots of love along the [G7]way
And [C]I remember just enough to [F]know how much we [C]had
And I'm saving it [G7]all for the [C][F]memo-ries
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
It's not right to hold someone [F]like we held on to [C]us
Lord knows the price is high for being [G7]free
And [C]I'll look back and cry about the [F]times you cried for [C]me
Yes I'm saving it [G7]all for the [C][F]memo-ries
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The [G7]soft warm nights that I spent lying in [F]your loving [C]arms
And the way [D7]I use to feel when you still met me at our [G7]door
[C]All the love we had is gone [F]except the part I'll [C]need
And I'm saving it [G7]all for the [C][F]memo-ries
