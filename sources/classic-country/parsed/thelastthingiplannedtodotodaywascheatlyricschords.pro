{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I fed an old stray dog this morning cause [C]he looked hungry
I [G]gave an old wino a dollar cause he was [A7]beggin' on the [D7]street
Because [G]you're what you are to me I [C]sent the roses
Oh the [G]last thing I planned to [D7]do today was [G]cheat
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I had some time to kill and [C]felt a little thirsty
I [G]went inside the local bar and in the [A7]corner took a [D7]seat
Had my [G]first cool sip then noticed she was [C]crying
Oh the [G]last thing I planned to [D7]do today was [G]cheat
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
But you [C]know I've always been so tender [G]hearted
I just [C]couldn't stand to watch her hurt that [G]way
And when she [C]said how much she wanted me to [G]hold her
I [A7]just didn't have the heart to turn [D7]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[G]Well I'm feeling guilty now but I [C]sure found it hard to leave her
[G]Cause there she lay sleeping all alone [A7]between the [D7]sheets
I [G]thought of your sweet love and all my good [C]intentions
Oh the [G]last thing I planned to [D7]do today was [G]cheat [C]
Oh the [G]last thing I planned to [D7]do today was [C]che[G]at
{end_of_verse}
