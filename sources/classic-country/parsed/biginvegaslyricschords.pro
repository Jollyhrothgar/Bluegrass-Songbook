{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]When I was young I left the home and went [F]away  to [C]Vegas
With my guitar and my dreams  I had to try [F]to play and sing  in [C]Vegas
But my [Am]momma told me I was [Em]wrong  and she [Am]begged me to stay at [Em]home
But my [F]will was strong and I had to make it big  [G7]in [C]Vegas
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
They'll put my name [G7]up in lights where I play  and the lines out [F]in
front will be long  [C]I'll [G7]get a standing ovation from the people [F]when 
I start to sing my [C]song  [F]when I turn 'em on in [C]Vegas
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well I've played every honky tonk and [F]smokey bar in [C]Vegas
And I guess I don't have what it [F]takes  for Las [C]Vegas
But my [Am]dreams still linger [Em]on  oh my [Am]faith is almost [Em]gone
But my [F]will is strong and I've gotta make it big  [G7]in [C]Vegas
