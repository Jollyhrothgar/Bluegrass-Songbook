{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G7]In the [C]morning when I wake a lovely [F]lady's always lying next [F][C]to [G7]me
[C]And that smile on her face is [Am]proof enough she's where she wants [Dm]to [G7]be
[Am]But just to let the whole world know she's [Em]mine forever [C][G7]more
[F]She wears my wedding [Fm]ring
[C]Sometimes I believe [G7]Lord it's me that's living every man's [F][C]dream
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]As the patterns on the wall dance to the [F]music
[Dm]Of the sunshine through [C]the [G7][F]trees
[C]The lady wakes to touch my face
[Am]And let me know she's there [Dm]to [G7]please
[Am]It's a moment such as this when [Em]that look comes in her [C][G7]eyes
[F]That makes me understand what heaven [Fm]means
[C]Sometimes I believe [G7]Lord it's me that's living every [C]man's [C][G7]dream
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]And when she softly [G7]whispers come [Em]to [Am]me
[Dm]The world takes [G7]on a sudden [C]glow
[F]And that warm [G7]feeling starts shootin' [Em]through [Am]me
[D7]As she leads me to the land where milk and honey [G7]flow
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]As the sunlight finds its way across the [F]room
[C]And settles warmly to the bed
[Am]Echoes of the lady's gently sighs run rampant [Dm]through my [G7]head
[Am]She turns ordinary moments [Em]into treasured [C][G7]memories
[F]And bathes in the pleasure that she [Fm]brings
[C]Sometimes I believe [G7]Lord it's me that's living every [C]man's [G7][F]dream
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[C]Sometimes I believe [G7]Lord it's me that's living every man's [C]dream
{end_of_verse}
