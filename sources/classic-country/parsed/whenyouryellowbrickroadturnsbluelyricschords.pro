[F]You say that [C]somewhere over the rain[F]bow

Well is the grass really all that [F]greener
Than [D7]here where you [G7]belong

You say that you're having [F]trouble

And I [Am]know there's a road you must [G7]follow

When your [C]yellow brick [G7]road turns [C]blue

So if you [C]ever find yourself [F]lonely
And [G7]things don't work out like you [C]planned
You know there'll be a place to come [F]home to
And that [D7]I will always [G7]understand
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [Am]hope that you find what you're [G7]after
And I hope [F]all of your dreams come [D7]true

When your [C]yellow brick [G7]road turns [C]blue
