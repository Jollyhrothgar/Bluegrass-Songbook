{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]The only thing that holds me at this distance from the [G7]door
[F]Is one final look at us across the suitcase on the [C]floor
[F]I've gone to far for staying it's too late to turn around
[G7]But I think I'd try if love could find [C]us [G7][F]now
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]I'd pick up all the pieces and I'd try to make 'em [G7]fit
[F]That rag tag dream we started with still has a song in [C]it
[F]And I'd find a way to sing it although I don't know how
[G7]I swear I would if love could find us [C]now
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G7]It's sad the way two people slowly turn their [F]minds
[C]And throw their love away
[G7]Then turn around and reach out for an [F]answer
[C]Where there's nothing left to say
[G7]I know it's time to take my bag
[F]And leave before our memory brings us [C]down
[F]Like I [G7]know it would if [F]love could [G7]find us [C]now
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Repeat last verse
{end_of_verse}
