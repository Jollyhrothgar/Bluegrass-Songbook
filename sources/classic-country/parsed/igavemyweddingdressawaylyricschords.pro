{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Tomorrow was to [G7]be my wedding [C]day
But [D7]I gave my wedding dress [G]away
Another will be [G7]holding my bou[C]quet
So [D7]I gave my wedding dress [G]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
My [C]baby sister [G]wanted him and [D7]so she took my [G]place
[C]It's worth a broken [G]heart to see the smile upon her [D7]face
I've [G]cared for her since [G7]mother went [C]away
So [D7]I gave my wedding dress [G]away
Spoken: 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Everything I ever [G7]wanted she always wanted too
And maybe [C]giving in to her was not the thing to do
I always [D7]let her have her way perhaps I wasn't strong
But I [G]was all she had to turn to when anything went wrong
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
She's all I had to live for [G7]she's all the joy I ever [C]had
And though she's hurt me many times she [D7]really isn't bad
I saw the love light in her [G]eyes the day she met my Jim
Then I knew that he belonged to [D7]her and she belonged to [G]him
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
If [C]I could win him [G]back again our [D7]love would be [G]divine
But [C]I could never [G]break her heart the way that she broke [D7]mine
I'll [G]worship him [G7]until my dying [C]day
But [D7]I gave my wedding dress [G]away
{end_of_verse}
