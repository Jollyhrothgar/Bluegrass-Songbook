{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]You said that you'd be mine and we [D7]signed that dotted line
I [G7]thought that we'd be happy you and [C]me
If I had only known your [D7]love was just a loan
For [G7]now you're asking me to set you [C]free
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [F]never thought your kisses were [C]like a charge account
That I'd [D7]have to pay in heartaches for [G7]taking my amount
I'll [C]give you back your love that [D7]I've had all these years
But I'm [G7]paying off the interest with my [C]tears
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
It's the expiration date you [D7]say there's no rebate
And I [G7]guess you'll say my heart is over[C]drawn
Another love you chose so [D7]my account is closed
And [G7]now I'll have an empty heart at [C]home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
My [F]credits discontinued you [C]say there's someone new
To take [D7]over all the payments on a [G7]heart that's overdue
I'll [C]give you back your love that [D7]I've had all these years
But I'm [G7]paying off the interest with my [C]tears
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I didn't understand your [D7]easy payment plan
That [G7]I would only have you for a [C]while
The love contract we wrote was a [D7]just a short term note
You [G7]placed my name on your inactive [C]file
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [F]never thought your kisses were [C]like a charge account
That I'd [D7]have to pay in heartaches for [G7]taking my amount
I'll [C]give you back your love that [D7]I've had all these years
But I'm [G7]paying off the interest with my [C]tears
{end_of_verse}
