{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I saw him [D7]again [G]today and [D7]I was [G]surprised
I [C]felt no pain inside my heart 
And no [G]teardrops filled my [D7]eyes
After [G]all the [D7]times I've [G]cried 
And [D7]wished that I could [G]die
I've come a [C]long long [D7]way from [G]goodbye
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
It's [C]strange that I could change so much 
But [G]I don't [D7]feel the [G]same
I didn't fall apart today [A7]when he called my [D7]name
I loved him [G]once I [D7]can’t [G]deny 
To [D7]try it would be a [G]lie
But I've come a [C]long long [D7]way from [G]goodbye
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I'll walk down [D7]life's lonely [G]road and [D7]find somebody [G]new
Then I will [C]find the happiness I [G]never had with [D7]you
They say true [G]love will [D7]never [G]die 
But [D7]time has turned the [G]tide
I've come a [C]long long [D7]way from [G]goodbye
{end_of_verse}
