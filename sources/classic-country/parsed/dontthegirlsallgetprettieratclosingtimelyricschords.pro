{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]The girls all get prettier at [F]closing time
They [G7]all begin to look like movie [C]stars[G7]
The [C]girls all get prettier at [F]closing time
[G7]When the change starts taking place
It puts a glow on every face
Of the falling angels of the back street [C]bars 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
If I could rate'em on a scale from [F]1 to 10
I'm [G7]looking for a 9 but 8 would slip right [C]in
A few more drinks and I might slip to a 5 or even a [F]4
[G7]But when tomorrow morning comes 
And I wake up with a number 1
I swear I'll never do it [C]anymore

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I don't mean to criticize the [F]girls at all
I [G7]know Robert Redford even over[C]hauls [G7]
We [C]all picture in our minds a girl that [F]looks just right
[G7]Ain't it funny ain't it strange
The way a man's opinion changes
When he starts to face that lonely [C]night
