[Am]He followed her to [F]work this morning[Dm] 
He'd never [G7]seen that dress [C]before
[Am]And she seemed to [C]sail right [F]through 
Those dark clouds formin' [Dm]
He [C]knows he's headed [F]for [G7]
After [Em]seven years of [Dm]marriage he [F]wanted out
Now after [Dm]seven months of [C]freedom 
It's [F]clear that there's no [G7]doubt

She's gonna [F]make it and he never [C]will
He's at the foot of that [Am]mountain she's over that [G7]hill

She's gonna [F]make it and [G7]he never [C]will[G7]

[Am]And you know it's [G7]not like she's [F]forgot about it [Dm]

You know it's driving him [G7]insane
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
And the [Em]crazy thing [Am]about it is 
She'd [F]take him back
But the [Dm]fool in him that [C]walked out 
Is the [F]fool that just won't [G7]ask

He's at the foot of that [Am]mountain she's over that [G7]hill
