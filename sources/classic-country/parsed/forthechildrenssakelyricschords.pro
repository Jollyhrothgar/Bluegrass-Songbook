{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Dear God give me the strength to hide [G7]my feelings from our [C]kids
I [D7]pray they’ll never know how my heart [G]aches
Their daddy doesn’t love me [G7]and I guess he never [C]did
He [D7]only stays here for the children’s [G]sake
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
If it was just the two of us [G7]I’d take my pride and [C]go
But [D7]what a world of difference kids can [G]make
For they need both a mom and dad [G7]we’d break their hearts I [C]know
So [D7]heaven help us for the children’s [G]sake
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I love him and I always will [G7]he’s sweet and kind to [C]me
But [D7]Lord it’s almost more than I can [G]take
Tonight I’ll meet him at the door [G7]he’ll kiss me tender[C]ly
And [D7]I’ll know it’s only for the children’s [G]sake
