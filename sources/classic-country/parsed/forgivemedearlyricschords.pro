{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I lost your love and started drinking
Trying [F]hard to stop from [C]thinking
Then I found that it was not the thing to [G7]do
I can’t stop my heart from [C]throbbing
Couldn’t [F]ease the pain by [C]sobbing
Forgive me dear and I will [G7]always do what’s [C]right
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
It’s my fault my heart is [G7]broken
Angry [F]words that we have [C]spoken
I’m so sorry for now I have seen the [G7]light
I only hope that you still love [C]me 
Cause I’ll [F]swear by stars above [C]me
Forgive me dear and I will [G7]always do what’s [C]right
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now I see that I was mistaken
And my [F]heart is slowly [C]breaking
Now I know that I was wrong right from the [G7]start
Let’s renew our old romance [C]dear
Please [F]just give me one more chance [C]now
Forgive me dear and I will [G7]always do what’s [C]right
