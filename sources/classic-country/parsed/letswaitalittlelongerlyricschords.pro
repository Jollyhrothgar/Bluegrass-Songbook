{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I can see you're not happy the way you've been actin'
And I think you'd like to be [D7]free
I know he's a good man but I know that you can
Be a whole lot happier with [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
In your eyes there's a yearning and inside you're burning
And I'd [G7]like to put out the [C]flame
So let's get together like [G]birds of a feather
And [D7]we'll let the love take the [G]blame
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
But right [C]now I don't think that I can [A#7]leave [F]him
[G]Lately he's been so good to [C]me [G]
And there [C]might be one small chance that things might [A#7]work [F]out
So let's wait a little [G]longer then we'll [C]see [D7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
But [G]wait I can make you forget him cause I'll take you
To places that you've never [D7]been
We'll make all the night spots the dim and the bright spots
And then we'll forget where we've [G]been
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
We'll walk sunny beaches and taste Georgia peaches
And [G7]swing from Maine to [C]Mexico
If you'll come along we can [G]make life a song
And you [D7]won't be tied down any[G]more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
But [C]still I don't think that I can [A#7]leave [F]him
[G]Lately he's been so good to [C]me [G]
And there [C]might be one small chance that things might [A#7]work [F]out
So let's wait a little [G]longer then we'll [C]see
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Yes let's [F]wait a little [G]longer then we'll [C]see
{end_of_verse}
