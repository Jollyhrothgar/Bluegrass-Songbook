{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Well I have lived a lot and done my [D7]part of [G]running [D7]round
And never did I think I’d let a [G]sweet love [D7]get me [G]down
But now I see how wrong I was you’re [G7]part of every [C]plan
[D7]Perhaps I’ll pay but come what may my heart’s at your [G]command
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh this aching breaking heart of mine is [D7]crazy [G]over [D7]you
And I’m afraid to let you know I [G]love you [D7]like I [G]do
For if you knew how much I care I [G7]know what you would [G]do
You’d [D7]drop me like the others and go find somebody [G]new
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Last night I saw you darling in the [D7]arms of [G]someone [D7]new
And I know that you don’t love him you [G]just want to [D7]make me [G]blue
I guess you think that hurting me will [G7]make me love you [C]more
But [D7]someday from you darling this old heart will lock its [G]door

For if you knew how much I care I [G7]know what you would [G]do
You’d [D7]drop me like the others and go find somebody [G]new
