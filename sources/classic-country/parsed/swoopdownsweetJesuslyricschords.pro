Well I know what You done for ol’ Daniel when he was [F]down in the lion’s [C]den

Of [F]You walking on the deep blue [C]sea
So want You swoop down sweet Jesus [G7]and put a hold on [C]me

I’ve been walking alone since mid-night with a [F]bottle and a heavy [C]mind

The Salvation Army rescued me so I wanna [G7]thank you for a brand new [C]day
