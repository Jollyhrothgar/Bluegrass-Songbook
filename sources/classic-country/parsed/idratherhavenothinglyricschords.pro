{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I jumped in the truck and headed for Kansas
Morning found me in Port Arkansas
[C]Sipping on rum in that [G]warm Texas sun
I've never been good at keeping direction
And I believe schedules are one of life's worst inflections
And I [C]gotta be free cause I'd [D7]rather nothing
Than a [C]whole lot of something I don't [G]need
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Yeah I'd [D7]rather have nothing than a [C]whole lot of something
That [G]don't fit the life that I [D7]lead
Material things and [C]all that wealth brings
Just [G]must be for some other [D7]breed
Cause [G]life ain't about the worries and doubts
That comes with the lust and the [C]greed
And I'd [G]rather have nothing 
Than a [D7]whole lot of something I don't [G]need
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I spent that evening in a tavern in town
With a bunch of my new friends my money brought round
And I [C]told them bout you and all the [G]hell we'd been through
Everyone there had a similar story
Years full of tears from all the heartache and worry
And [C]we all agreed that we'd [D7]rather have nothing
Than a [C]whole lot of something we don't [G]need
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Yeah I'd [D7]rather have nothing than a [C]whole of something
That [G]don't fit the life that I [D7]lead
Commitment and strings and [C]all that love brings
Just [G]must be for some other [D7]breed
Cause [G]life ain't about the worries and doubts
That comes with the lust and the [C]greed
And I'd [G]rather have nothing 
Than a [D7]whole lot of something I don't [Em]need
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
0h I'd [G]rather have nothing 
Than a [D7]whole lot of something I don't [G]need
{end_of_verse}
