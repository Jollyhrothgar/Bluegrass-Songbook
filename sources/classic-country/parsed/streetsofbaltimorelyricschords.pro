{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Well I sold the farm to [F]take my woman [C]where she longed to [F]be
We [G7]left our kin and all our friends back there in [C]Tennessee
And I bought those one way [F]tickets she had [C]often begged me [F]for
And [G7]they took us to the streets of [C]Baltimore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G7]Well her heart was filled with gladness when she saw those city [C]lights
She said the prettiest place on earth was Baltimore at [G7]night
[C]Well a man feels proud to [F]give his woman [C]what she's longing [F]for
And I [G7]kind of like the Streets of [C]Baltimore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Then I got myself a [F]factory job I ran [C]an old [F]machine
And I [G7]bought a little cottage in a neighborhood [C]serene
And every night when I'd [F]come home [C]with every muscle [F]sore
She'd [G7]drag me through the Streets of [C]Baltimore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Well I did my best to [F]bring her back to [C]what she used to [F]be
Then I [G7]soon learned she loved those bright lights more than she loved [C]me
Now I'm a-going back on that [F]same train that [C]brought me here [F]before
While [G7]my baby walks the streets of [C]Baltimore
While [G7]my baby walks the streets of [C]Baltimore
{end_of_verse}
