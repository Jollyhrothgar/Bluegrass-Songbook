Did You Ever Go Sailing 
Recorded T. Texas Tyler
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G]There's an old ramshackle shack where in [C]dreams I wander [G]back
And listen to the [A7]southern melo[D7]dy
T'was the [G]place where I was born on a [C]bright October [G]morn
And it's [C]nestled at the [G]end of my [D7]river of memo[G]ries
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Did you ever go sailing down the [C]river of memo[G]ries
To the little log cabin that's [A7]nestled among the sycamore [D7]trees
Where the [G]sunshine is cheery and [C]nothing in the world grows [G]dreary
That's my [C]cabin at the [G]end of my [D7]river of memo[G]ries
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
There's a mother old and gray at the [C]end of memory's [G]way
I will meet her there [A7]tonight among the [D7]trees
With a [G]smile of welcome she so [C]sweetly beckons [G]me
To the [C]cabin at the [G]end of my [D7]river of memo[G]ries
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Twilight shadows fall many [C]childhood voices [G]call
Call me back again to the [A7]days that used to [D7]be
And in [G]answer to their prayer I will [C]soon be sailing [G]there
To the [C]cabin at the [G]end of my [D7]river of memo[G]ries
{end_of_verse}
