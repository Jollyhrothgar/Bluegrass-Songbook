[C]I'm sorry I was [G7]weak enough to step out on [C]you
Well I should have been [G7]strong enough not to step out on you [C]too

I'm not making ex[G7]cuses for myself I was wrong as I could [C]be
But you shouldn't have [G7]cheapened yourself tryin' to get even with [C]me
My conscience bothers me mine won't [C7]let me sleep at [F]night
Because one of us was [C]wrong don't mean the [G7]other one was [C]right
{end_of_verse}

Two [G7]wrongs don't make one right and [F]now we both got [C]heartaches
[D7]But if we both try we can [G7]forgive each other for our mistakes
We’re lettin’ a [C]wonderful love slip through our hands
We'd better [C7]hold on [F]tight
Because one of us was [C]wrong don't mean the [G7]other one was [C]right
{end_of_verse}
