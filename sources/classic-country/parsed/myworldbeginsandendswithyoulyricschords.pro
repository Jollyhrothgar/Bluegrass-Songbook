[G]My world was [F#m]no more than a [B7]dream
And [Em]waitin' on a [A7]dream can sure get [Am]lonely[D7]

Oh [G]my world begins with having a friend when [C]I'm feelin' blue[D7]
My [G]world would end if ever I heard you [C]say we were through

Cause my [Am]world [Bm]begins and [C]ends [D7]with [G]you

I just [Em]need your [A7]smile comin' [Am]to me 
[C]Reassur[D7]in' me
