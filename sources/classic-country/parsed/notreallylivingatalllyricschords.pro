{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I come home in the evenin' there's
No laughter there to fill the air
A cold lonely [C7]room to [F]meet me
Nobody here to [C]greet me
Where has our love [G7]gone
And [C]then my thoughts begin to stray
Back to a happy yesterday
When love was [C7]here be[F]side me
Your love was here to [C]guide me
[G7]Where did I go [C]wrong

I reach down for the paper
And I see a toy our little boy
Left lying there every[G7]day
I [C]guess I never took the time
To fix a hurt or make a rhyme
Or carry him [C7]on my [F]shoulder
Will he forgive me when he's [C]older
Or [G7]will he remember my [C]name

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
I found a puppy down the street
With big sad eyes and muddy feet
There's nobody [C7]here to [F]claim him
No one around here to [C]name him
Or take him for a [G7]walk
I [C]keep him here for company
And he looks up so sad at me
Each time he [C7]sees me [F]cryin'
He knows inside I'm [C]dyin'
If [G7]only he could [C]talk
{end_of_verse}
