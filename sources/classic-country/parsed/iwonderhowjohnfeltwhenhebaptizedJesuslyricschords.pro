[C]Do you remember how you felt [F]when you kissed your brand new [C]bride
Or the feeling that ran through you when you [D7]held your new born [G7]child
And [C]when he called you daddy [F]did you feel ten feet [C]tall
Well I heard about a man who must have had [G7]the greatest thrill of [C]all

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
John was just an ordinary [F]man like you and [C]me
And he did lotta preaching near [D7]the Sea of Gali[G7]lee
Well [C]he must have been a pretty good preacher 
Cause [F]he sure could tell the [C]news
But he said there's a man coming after me and [G7]I can't tie His [C]shoes

I wonder how John felt when he baptized [F]Jesus
How did he feel when [C]Jesus came and [D7]said let it be [G7]done

Don't you know it was a [C]blessin' to [G7]baptize God's only [C]Son

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
John talked to a lot of people and [F]many saw the [C]light
But what about walking up and shaking [D7]hands with Jesus [G7]Christ
I [C]wonder if he trembled when [F]he first saw the [C]Man
Don't you know he felt the spirit when he [G7]touched the Master's [C]Hand
