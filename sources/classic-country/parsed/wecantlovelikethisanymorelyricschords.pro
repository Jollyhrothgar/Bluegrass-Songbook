[C]You're laying right beside me but you're a million miles [F]away
And if I ask [C]you what's the matter you don't have much to [G7]say
And I can tell [C]that I'm not standing where I stood with you [F]before
And we can't [Dm]love [Em]like [Dm]this [C][G7]anymore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Sometimes it makes me angry but mostly it just [F]hurts
I thought time [C]might make it better but it's only made it [G7]worse
And I can't climb [C]these walls you're building and I can't unlock the [F]door 
And we can't [Dm]love [Em]like [Dm]this [C][G7]anymore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]We're coming to a [G7]crossroad I can [C]tell
I'm not [F]sure we'd be this [G7]lonely by [C7][C]ourselves
But I [F]won't give up as [G7]long as there's a [Am]chance
So [F]where we go from [A]here is in your [G7]hands
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Just say it's [C]over and at least I'll [C7]know for [F]sure
And we can't [Dm]love [Em]like [Dm]this [F][G7]anymore
And we can't [Dm]love [Em]like [Dm]this [C][G7]anymore
{end_of_verse}
