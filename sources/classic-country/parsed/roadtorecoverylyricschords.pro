{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G7]Tonight there's a fire burning [C]brightly 
In my [G7]chimney though the weather's far from [C]cold
It's your [F]pictures and the letters you've [C]sent me
You're gone so your [G7]memories must [C]go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [G7]have cried until I'm too weak to [C]cry
I [G7]have drank until the drinks won't go [C]down
I [F]must start on the road to [C]recovery[Am]
[C]Before there's no [G7]turning a[C]round
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I [G7]realize there's little hope for [C]me
If I [G7]keep your sweet memories this [C]way
But just [F]knowing that I've lost you [C]forever
Life's a long wait from [G7]here to my [C]grave
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Just [G7]tonight I'll rely on the [C]wine
To dim your [G7]memory till the last drop goes [C]down
Then I'll [F]start on the road to [C]recovery[Am]
There'll [C]soon be no [G7]turning a[C]round
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I must [F]start on the road to [C]recovery[Am]
Before [C]there's no [G7]turning a[C]round
{end_of_verse}
