[C]I burned all those [F]pictures at [C]least ten years ago
That [G7]one of you beside the car was [C]hardest to let go
That shoe [C7]box full of [F]memories [C]promises and lies
The [G7]smoke from those old letters still gets in my [C]eyes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]Just a few old [G7]memories of [C]how it used to be
[F]Old songs and [G7]old friend re[C]mind me constant[G7]ly 
To [C]think how close I [F]was to you [C]still gets close to me
But [G7]all that’s left for me to love are a few old memo[C]ries
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
There’s still a silver [F]bracelet [C]around the house somewhere
It’s [G7]probably in that old trunk we [C]keep beneath the stairs
The words [C7]you had put [F]on it have [C]tarnished and turned
[G7]It and a few old memories are all that wouldn’t [C]burn
