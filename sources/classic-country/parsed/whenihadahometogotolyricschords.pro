{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
She loved me [C]more than life its self
But the liquid diet I was on starved our love to [G7]death
So [C]it’s not hard to figure out why my baby’s [F]gone 
Cause when I had a home to go [C]to  [G7]I never did go [C]home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
That house [G7]was quite a show place ten rooms two maids two [C]cars
So [D7]now that I’ve got no place I sure walk them [G7]bars
So [C]pour another double while I tell you what went [F]wrong
When I had a home to go [C]to  I [G7]never did go [C]home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
But wait I see her standing at the door
And those big soft eyes are saying we can try once [G7]more
So [C]forget the double keep the change you can call me [F]gone
Cause while I have a home to go [C]to  [G7]this time I’m going [C]home
{end_of_verse}
