{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]As I turn back the [C7]pages of [F]time
And once [C]more you're in my heart and on my [G7]mind
They're [C]unchanged by the [C7]passing of [F]years
All [C]alone stands the [G7]tower of [F]tear[C]s
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Just a wooden frame and [C7]one old rusty [F]bell
With a [C]million sad stories to [G7]tell
Hidden [C]there neath the [C7]rock and the [F]rill
We pledged our [C]love neath the [G7]tower of [F]tear[C]s
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
But as [F]time passed on I started [C]losing you
And now [D7]you are gone what am I [G7]gonna do
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Now the [C]tower bell [C7]refuses to [F]chime
Cause some[C]how it knows that you're no longer [G7]mine
It [C]shared our secrets [C7]down through the [F]years
Now I'm [C]alone neath the [G7]tower of [F]tear[C]s
{end_of_verse}
