Save from wrath and [D7]make me [G]pure

Could my tears [C]forever [G]flow 
Could my zeal [D7]no languor [G]know
His for [D7]sin could not [G]atone 
Thou must [D7]save and Thou [G]alone
In my hand no [C]prize I [G]bring 
Simply to [D7]Your cross I’ll [G]cling

While I draw this [C]fleeting [G]breath 
When my eyes [D7]shall close in [G]death
When I [D7]rise to worlds un[G]known 
And be[D7]hold Thee on Thy [G]throne
Rock of ages [C]cleft for [G]me 
Let me hide [D7]myself in [G]Thee
