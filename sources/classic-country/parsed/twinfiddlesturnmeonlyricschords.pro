{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Twin fiddles watch you turn me on 
It made me want to dance till dawn
And you turn my whole world on when I first [A7]met her[D7]
The way we [C]danced to the shuffle [D7]beat
It seems to [C]make the night complete
Loving [D7]two part harmony that's what we [G]were
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Twin fiddles turn me on help me forget she's [C]gone
[Am]For I have never [D7]felt so all alone
I'm [G]back here in the crowd
[D7]Turn your [G]volume way up [C]loud
[G]Play your best for me [D7]twin fiddles turn me [G]on
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
For a while our love was going strong
But then our melody went wrong 
Without a harmony I found myself [A7]alone[D7]
And the [C]blues are all I [D7]see 
Oh I [C]miss that shuffle beat
Fiddles [D7]play your best for me turn me [G]on
{end_of_verse}

[G]Play your best for me [D7]twin fiddles turn me [G]on
