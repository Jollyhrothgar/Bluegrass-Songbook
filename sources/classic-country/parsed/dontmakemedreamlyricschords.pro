{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I can't believe you're at my door [F]again[G7]
You [C]hurt me once I shouldn't let you [F]in [G7]

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Don't make me [C]dream if dreaming can't come [F]true
Don't make me [G7]dream if I can't have [C]you
Don't make me mad don't make me cry
Don't stay a [F]while then say goodbye
Don't touch the [G7]feelings we once knew
Don't make me [F]dream [G7]if dreaming can't come [C]true
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
There was a time I lived to feel your [F]touch [G7]
I [C]never knew goodbye could hurt so [F]much [G7]
But [Dm]I still see some [Am]magic in your [G7]eyes
So [Dm]don't come back and [Am]tell those same sweet [G7]lies
