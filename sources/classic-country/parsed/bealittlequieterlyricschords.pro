{meta: title Be A Little Quieter}
{meta: artist Porter Wagoner}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]When you left you said you [F]would not be [C]returning
Nothing here you'd ever want to see [G7]again
But each [C]night you've come to [F]visit me in [C]memories
And won't you be a little [G7]quieter if you [C]can
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Last [F]night I heard you walking in the [C]hallway
And your footsteps sounded like a marching [G7]band
And [C]I haven't slept [F]in so long I can't [C]remember
So won't you be a little [G7]quieter if you [C]can
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well you're back again [F]tonight in the [C]kitchen
I can hear you as you rattle the pots and [G7]pans
Oh [C]what I'd give to see [F]you when you [C]visit me
Cause these lonely walls're [G7]driving me [C]insane
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
When [F]you're finished with your bath please close the [C]closet
The dripping water sounds just like a driving [G7]rain
Each [C]night I'm looking [F]forward to your [C]visit
But won't you be a little [G7]quieter if you [C]can
I wish you'd be a little [G7]quieter if you [C]can
{end_of_verse}
