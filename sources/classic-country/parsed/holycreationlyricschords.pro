{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]So many questions  so many [C]answers
So many [G]reasons  most of them [D7]wrong
Facin' the [G]future  with the faith of my [C]Father
I let a [G]stranger [D7]  into my [G]home  [D7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And right there [G]before me  I saw it [C]happen
There's no [G]denyin'  nothin's the [D7]same
But the truth is a [G]high-way leadin' to [C]freedom
All is for[G]given [D7]  love is to [G]blame   [G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And I seen him [C]hold her with his head on her [G]shoulder
Singing her [D7]love songs  soft as her [G]smile  [G7]
Tender [C]affection  under the [G]rainbow
Holy [D7]creation  mother and [G]child  [D7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I know the [G]story  I read the [C]papers
I see the [G]anger  I feel it [D7]too
But when I see the [G]wonder  in the smiles of my [C]children
It reminds of [G]dreams [D7]  worth comin' [G]true  [G7]
{end_of_verse}

Holy [D7]creation  mother and [G]child  [D7]
