[G]Loving you is [C]all I've ever [G]needed
My world's all you've [A7]ever cared [D7]about
The [G]longer we're to[C]gether the [G]more I know
You're the [C]one thing I [A7]can't [D7]live with[G]out
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And I wake up and [C]find you every [G]morning
Kissing me in[A7]to another [D7]day
And [G]every now and [C]then I find me [G]wondering
How [C]I deserve to [A7]be [D7]loved this [G]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Without you [C]there'd be no song to [G]sing
There'd be no [C]dreams to [G]build and be [A7]proud of [D7]
With[C]out you life would be un[G]bearable
Cause without [C]you there's [A7]no such [D7]thing as [G]love[C]  [G]
{end_of_verse}

Without [C]you there's [A7]no such [D7]thing as [G]love[C]  [G]
