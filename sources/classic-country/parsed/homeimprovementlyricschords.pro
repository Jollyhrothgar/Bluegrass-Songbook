{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]The walls that surround us are slowly crumbling down
But the heart of this foundation is [G7]still on solid ground
Just needs some renovation and a lot of TLC
And a long night of loving is all that we both [C]need
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
So roll the shades down lock the doors up tight turn on the code-a-phone
If the doorbell rings we'll just stay in bed and [G7]pretend nobody's home
Let the neighbors think we moved away or forgot to pay the rent
There ain't nothing wrong with this old house
It just needs a little home im[C]provement
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Every day we go our separate ways to make our dreams come true
But it ain't worth the sacrifice if we're [G7]giving up me and you
We gotta hold on tighter than tight to the ties that make us strong
And get back to the roots that made this house a [C]home
