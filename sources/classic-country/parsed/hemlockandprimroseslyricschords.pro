{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Thinking of you while out for a ramble
Down [C]by  [D7]a cold frosty [G]stream
Set down on a bed of hemlocks and primroses
And gently [C]I  [D7]fell into a [G]dream
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I dreamed I saw a pretty fair maiden
Such beauty [C]I  [D7]never saw [G]before
Her dress was bound round with hemlocks and primroses
So green [C]was  [D7]the mantel she [G]wore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Her hair was of a dark brown color
Her teeth was [C]as  [D7]ivory so [G]white
Her eyes they shined like sparking diamonds
Of stars than [C]sh--i[D7]ne on a cold frosty [G]night
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I drew her near then I awakened
With two empty [C]ar-[D7]ms and you on my [G]mind
Heaven seemed so near while I was dreaming
It hurts to [C]kn-[D7]ow you left me [G]behind
{end_of_verse}
