{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Well I bought me a donkey about four foot tall
To plough my cotton in the early [G7]fall
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
He's running around it was an awful sin
I had to [C]build a fence to [G7]keep my donkey [C]in
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I rigged up the wire with a battery charge
To keep my donkey from a-running at [G7]large
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Inside this bin I turned him loose
Corralled by [C]volts of [G7]electrified [C]juice
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[F]Which way did my donkey go
[C]If you see him let me know
[F]I haven't seen my donkey since
He [C]backed into that [G7]electrified [C]fence
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Now the first time he backed up against it
He threw back his ears and he had a [G7]fit
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
He brayed real loud and he hit high gear
He [C]jumped up into the [C][G7]stratosphere
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
I just got word from Albuquerque
A donkey up there was looking for [G7]work
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 9}
He's my donkey and his name is Jack
Oh [C]how I wish he'd [G7]come on [C]back
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I rigged up the wire with a battery charge
To keep my donkey from a-running at [G7]large
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 10}
Now more word came from Palamar
A man up there was a-watching the [G7]stars
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 11}
While looking through his telescope
He [C]nearly had [G7]himself a [C]stroke
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 12}
He saw something riding up the rainbow trail
Two long ears and a cockabur [G7]tail
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 13}
This thing he saw when he informed the states
Was a [C]donkey heading for the [G7]pearly [C]gates
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I rigged up the wire with a battery charge
To keep my donkey from a-running at [G7]large
{end_of_verse}
