{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I woke up this morning in a terrible mood
Now you talk about a woman treatin' a good man rude
She had me [F]talkin' to myself gazin' at that mean ol' [C]wall
She [G7]had another daddy waitin' down at the end of the [C]hall
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
She changed with the weather like the leaves I recall
She blossoms in the spring but then she's gone in the fall
A [F]two timin' woman with a heart of solid [C]stone
She [G7]tells me that she loves me 
But her heart's a little under[C]grown
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well she drifts around the country like a steamboat on a foam
She said she'd never leave me but she got the urge to roam
She [F]never changes course she just goes along that same ol' [C]way
Well I [G7]hope she keeps a driftin' rolls along back home some[C]day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Cause if I ever find her gonna chain her to the floor
And tell her now sit there woman you ain't leavin' no more
I'm [F]gonna tame you mama till you're eatin' from my [C]hand
It [G7]ain't that I don't love you honey 
It's just to make you under[C]stand
{end_of_verse}
