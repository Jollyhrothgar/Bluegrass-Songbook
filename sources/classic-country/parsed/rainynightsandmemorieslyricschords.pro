{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]It's hard to hide a lingering [C][F]disappointment
[G7]But most of the time I wear [C]it [G7]well
[C]But there are times when I just can't help [F]remembering
[C]The night you left that [G7]rainy night when my whole [C]future [G7]fell
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]Rainy nights and memories go [F]together
[C]And with every drop of rain I feel the [G7]pain
[C]I can almost hear my pleading on the night you were [F]leaving
[C]But I might as well [G7]have tried to stop [C]the [G7]rain
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]The blowing wind that [F]moans outside my [C]window
[G7]Seems to echo the closing [C]of a [G7]door
[C]For it was then I first realized I had heard your last [F]goodbye
[C]And my whole world went [G7]crumbling to the [C]floor
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]Rainy nights and memories go [F]together

[C]I can almost hear my pleading on the night you were [F]leaving
[C]But I might as well [G7]have tried to stop [C]the [G7]rain
