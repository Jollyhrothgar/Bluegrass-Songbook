I keep my yard cut as [F]close as it can [C]be
There's no litter laying [D7]round for one to [G7]see
And I [C]know someday I'll [F]tell this place [C]goodbye
[F]But till [C]then it's [F]sure a [C]lovely [G7]place to [C]cry

[C]But some[F]day someone will buy this place
And live [C]happy if they try
[F]But for [C]us it's [F]been a [C]lovely [G7]place to [C]cry[F]  [C]
