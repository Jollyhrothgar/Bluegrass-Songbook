[C]I'm tired of eating out of your hand I'm [F]tired of getting [D7]told
These [G7]blues are leaving me as of now I'll be the one so [C]bold
You better walk the chalk line and [F]let this poor man [D7]be
Or [G7]else you'll find yourself alone footloose and fancy [C]free

Eating out of your hand you think you've [F]got me on a [Dm]string
You've [G7]fooled me more than once but let me tell you just one [C]thing

A [G7]man can only take so much of eating out of your [C]hand

You're oh so domineering your [F]wish is my [D7]command
Your [G7]jealous heart won't let me live you boss me and [C]demand

On [G7]payday I'm your victim and I'm eating out of your [C]hand

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
When I come home you're waiting to [F]question what I've [D7]done
You [G7]have my free time planned for me I work from sun to [C]sun
If only you would realize that [F]old stuff gets [D7]old
A [G7]man likes just a little time that he can call his [C]own
