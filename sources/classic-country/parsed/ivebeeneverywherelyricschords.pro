[C]I was totin' my pack
Along the dusty Winnemucca road
When along came a semi
With a high and canvas covered load
[F]If you're going to Winnemucca Mack
With me you can ride
[C]So I climbed into the cab
And then I settled down inside

With so much dust and sand
[C]And I said,  Listen Bud I've traveled
Every road in this here land
