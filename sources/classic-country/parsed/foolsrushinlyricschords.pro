[Am]Fools rush in [D7]where angels fear to [G]tread
[Em]And so I come to [Am]you my [D7]love 
My heart above my [G]head

If [D7]there's a [Am]chance for me [A7]then I don't [D7]care

[Am]Fools rush in [D7]where wise men never [G]go
But [Em]wise men never [Am]fall in [D7]love

[Am]When we met I felt my [G]life [Em]begin
So open up your [Am]heart and [D7]let this [Am]fool rush [G]in
