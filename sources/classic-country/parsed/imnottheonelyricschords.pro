{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]You say that he's the one you love
But lately you can't get [F]along
And every time you turn [G7]around
Something else just turns out [C]wrong
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G7]You say that work takes all his [C]time
Instead when he walks through the [F]door
You'd give that ladder he has [G7]climbed
To have the love you had [C]before
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
But I'm not the one you should be [F]talking to
Understanding all you're [C]going through
And there's really nothing [D7]I can do
But tell you where I'd walk if [G7]I were [F]in your [Em]shoes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]I'm not the one who should be [F]hearing this
He needs to know how much you [Am]miss his kiss
Oh you tell me that your [Dm]heart is [Em]true
[F]But I'm not the one you [G7]should be [F]talking to
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[G7]You should be walking out the [C]door
Instead of lying here with [F]me
Oh you're wasting precious [G7]time
Time with him is all you [C]need
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
[G7]Well it may not be too [C]late
To get back all those dreams you [F]shared
It'd be easy as a [G7]touch
If he only knew how much you [C]cared
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
But I'm not the one you should be [F]talking to
Understanding all you're [C]going through
And there's really nothing [D7]I can do
But tell you where I'd walk if [G7]I were [F]in your [Em]shoes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]I'm not the one who should be [F]hearing this
He needs to know how much you [Am]miss his kiss
Oh you tell me that your [Dm]heart is [Em]true
[F]But I'm not the one you [G7]should be [F]talking to
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
[Am]Oh you say you feel just [Dm]like a [Em]fool
[F]And I'm not the one you [G7]should be [F]talking to[C]
{end_of_verse}
