{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G7]Makes no [C]difference if we two [C7]are far apart [F]dear
I could [C]never ever love somebody [G7]new
Cause there [C]isn't any room [C7]inside my heart [F]dear
While I'm [G7]chained to a memory of [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C7]I could never [F]tell another I belong to [C]them
All the whispered words of love would not be [G7]true
I could [C]never tell another [C7]that I long for [F]them
Cause I'm [G7]chained to a memory of [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G7]Maybe [C]time will wear the links [C7]away and then [F]dear
They will [C]break and set me free to love [G7]anew
But I'll [C]never care for someone [C7]else again [F]dear
While I'm [G7]chained to a memory of [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C7]If the world [F]should end tomorrow I'd be [C]satisfied
Cause you're gone and there is nothing I can [G7]do
All my [C]dreams and precious hopes of [C7]yesterday have [F]died
Yet I'm [G7]chained to a memory of [C]you
{end_of_verse}
