[C]Stop here across the street to your [G7]right
That's where my house lives sometimes I stayed there at [C]night

And [D7]she'd wait there in her lonely room [G7]but oh that's been so long ago

And now it waits there this house that used to be my [C]home

But [D7]right there is where my [G7]house lives all [C]alone
