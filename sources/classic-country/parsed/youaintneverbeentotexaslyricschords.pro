{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Saw a man on the TV [Am]he's out in California
[D7]Talking about where we all came [G]from

[Am]About where we all came from or what life is [D7]all about

You ain't never heard a [Am]coyote crying
Or a [D7]young colt take off running for the [G]first time
Well I've [Am]thought a lot about it [D7]sometimes we overthink it
But the [G]only thing that [D7]makes any [Em]sense is
If you [Am]don't believe in God [D7]you ain't never been to [G]Texas
