{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I've convinced everybody I've forgotten you at [D7]last
[G]That my heart has healed completely from the heartbreaks of the past
[G7]They can't see the tears I'm hiding how they hurt me when you [C]left
[G]I've convinced everybody   [D7]everybody but [G]myself
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[D7]When somebody mentions you my heart can feel the sting
[G]But I play the part so perfectly no one suspects a thing
[G7]Then they see me smiling and I'm with somebody [C]else
[G]I've convinced everybody   [D7]everybody but [G]myself
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[D7]I act so nonchalantly when they mention my old flame
[G]I pretend as though I'm searching when I start to call your name
[G7]It would be a different story if they knew just how I [C]felt
[G]I've convinced everybody   [D7]everybody but [G]myself
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[D7]You probably heard from others how indifferent I have been
[G]But they only see the upside they can't see me deep within
[G7]And if you believe them there's just one person [C]left
[G]I've convinced everybody   [D7]everybody but [G]myself
{end_of_verse}
