{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I have searched a sea of faces but not one [F]of them [C]replaces
That old feeling every time I looked at [G7]you
Oh [C]how well I can remember your [F]love so sweet and [C]tender
And that's why I'm searching [G7]for another [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But no one seems [F]to ease this longing there's no feeling of [C]belonging
Oh how lonely is this heart you've broke in [G7]two
I only [C]live for your returning with each tear [F]that falls I'm [C]learning
That I'll never ever [G7]find another [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
But no one seems [F]to ease this longing there's no feeling of [C]belonging
Oh how lonely is this heart you've broke in [G7]two
I only [C]live for your returning with each tear [F]that falls I'm [C]learning
That I'll never ever [G7]find another [C]you
