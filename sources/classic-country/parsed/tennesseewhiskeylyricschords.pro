{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G]You're as [C]smo-oth as Tennessee [G]whiskey
You're as sweet as strawberry [D7]wine
You're as [G]warm as [G7]a glass [C]of brandy
And I stay [G]stoned on your [D7]love all the [G]time
{end_of_verse}

[G]I looked for love in [C]all the wrong [G]places
Found the bottom of the bottle always [D7]dry
But when [G]you poured out your love [C]I didn't [G]waste it
Cause there nothing like your [D7]love to get [G]me high
{end_of_verse}
