{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]When you gaze into her eyes 
And you think of [F]paradise
You're not [C]blind to the ways of a [G7]woman
When you hear her soft voice [C]speak
And you feel sorta of [F]weak
You're not [C]wise to the ways [G7]of a [C]woman
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
For they'll take you and they'll [F]hold you
Then they'll set your heart [C]aside
And take the happiness [D7]they've given you
And watch it break [G7]your pride
That's the way they want to treat [C]you
If you think they won't defeat [F]you
You're [C]not wise to the ways [G7]of a [C]woman
