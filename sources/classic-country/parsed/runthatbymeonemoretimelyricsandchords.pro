[F]Run that by me one more time
To make sure that I heard you right
I hope you don't expect me to [G7]believe that line

And I know a lie when I hear one
Would [G7]you run that [F]by me one more [C]time
{end_of_verse}

Well you're late again I see

Don't you try to kiss and make up
When you smell so strong from [C]wine
{end_of_verse}

Well I'm not late the clock is wrong
You need to wind Big [F]Ben
Honey that's not wine you smell
[G7]That's aftershave for [C]men

What happened to the money
Well I gave you to pay the [G7]rent
The rent is overdue 
And we ain't got one red [C]cent
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Well I put it in the cookie jar
The day you brought it [F]home
One day when I came back from town
I [G7]looked and I'll be dogged if
That money wasn't [C]gone
Would you run that by me one more time
{end_of_verse}
