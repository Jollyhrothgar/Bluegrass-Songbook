{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I’ve traveled all [G7]around this [C]country
In my time I [G7]thought I’d seen it [C]all
But [F]today I took [G7]a detour down [Am]a [G7]back-road
Through a [D7]little town whose name I can’t [G7]recall
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
There were [C]old men on [G7]benches playing [C]checkers
Children playing [G7]hopscotch on the [C]square
And [F]high above a [G7]statue of an unknown [F][Am]soldier
Old [C]Glory was [G7]waving in the [C]air
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[Am]Suddenly I realized [F]what I’d too long [C]forgotten
A [Am]chill rose up like [F]mountains on my [G7]skin
[Am]Overcome with the [F]feeling I knew [C]I was [F]seeing
[C]America all over [C][G7]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
{comment: F    G7}
{comment: A—mer-icana}
[F]Pictures of a [G7]people proud and [C]free
[F][Am]A—m-ericana  [D7]I’ll [G7]keep holding to [Am]the [G7]dream
You’re [F]still what [G7]living means to [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I knew to stop [G7]would throw me off my [C]schedule
But I parked around [G7]behind the Five and [C]Dime
There’s [F]something bout [G7]a small town in [Am]the [G7]summer
Like a [D7]Norman Rockwell picture back in [G7]time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Kids were [C]courting at the Rexall [G7]soda [C]fountain
Like we did before they [G7]built the shopping [C]mall
I saw [F]so many [G7]reasons  why [Am]I love this [F]country
You [C]know some things never [G7]really change at [C]all
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
[Am]As I left the 2 lane road and pulled [F]back on that [C]superhighway
I [Am]thought of what I’d [F]seen back in that [G7]town
And it hit me like [Am]a freight train        [F]C                     FThat a stones throw from the fast lane
[C]America is [G7]still safe and [C]sound
{end_of_verse}

{comment: F    G7}
{comment: A—mer-icana}
[F]Pictures of a [G7]people proud and [C]free
[F][Am][C]A—m-ericana, [D7]I’ll [G7]keep holding to [Am]the [G7]dream
You’re [F]still what [G7]living means to [C]me
{end_of_verse}
