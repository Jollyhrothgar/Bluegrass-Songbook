{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I was walking past your window late last [D7]night
There were [G7]lights on but your shades were pulled down [C]tight
I decided to come in and spend some [D7]time
Then I [G7]looked and something made me change my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
There were shadows covered shadows on the [G7]wall
[F]Holding one [G7]another  [F]clinging to each [G7]other
And I felt my heart [C]fall
I just stood there not believing what I [G7]saw
[F]Right outside your [G7]window
[F]Watching the [G7]shadows on the [C]wall
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Like a drowning man who sees his past go [D7]by
I was [G7]seeing all my future slowly [C]die
I believed you and I loved you all the [D7]time
But the [G7]shadows said you weren't really [C]mine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
There were shadows covered shadows on the [G7]wall
[F]Holding one [G7]another  [F]clinging to each [G7]other
And I felt my heart [C]fall
I just stood there not believing what I [G7]saw
[F]Right outside your [G7]window
[F]Watching the [G7]shadows on the [C]wall
