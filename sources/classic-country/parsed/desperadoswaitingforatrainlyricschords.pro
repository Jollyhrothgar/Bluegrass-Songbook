[C]I'd play the Red River Valley[A#7]    [Am]
And he'd [G7]sit out in the kitchen and [Am]cry
And run his [F]fingers through [Dm]seventy years of [C]living[Am]
And wonder [F]Lord has every [Dm]well I've drilled run [G7]dry
We were friends me and this old [C]man
Like [Am]desperados waiting for a [F]train
Like [Am]desperados waiting for a [F]train[Am]   [Dm]   [G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
He's a [C]drifter and a driller of oil wells[A#7]    [Am]
And an [G7]old school man of the [Am]world
He [F]let me drive his [Dm]car when he's too [C]drunk to[Am]
And he'd [F]wink and give me [Dm]money for the [G7]girls
And our lives were like some old western [C]movie
Like [Am]desperados waiting for a [F]train
Like [Am]desperados waiting for a [F]train[Am]   [Dm]   [G7]

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
From the [C]time that I could walk he'd take me with him[A#7]    [Am]
To a [G7]bar called the Green Frog [Am]Cafe
There were [F]old men with [Dm]beer guts and domi[C]nos[Am]
[F]Lying 'bout their [Dm]lives while they'd [G7]played
And I was just a kid they all called his side[C]kick
Like [Am]desperados waiting for a [F]train
Like [Am]desperados waiting for a [F]train[Am]   [Dm]   [G7]

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
One [C]day I looked up and he's pushing eighty[A#7]    [Am]
And there's [G7]brown tobacco stains all down his [Am]chin
To [F]me he's one of the [Dm]heroes of this [C]country[Am]
So [F]why's he all dressed [Dm]up like them old [G7]men
Drinking beer and playing Moon and Forty-[C]two
Like [Am]desperados waiting for a [F]train
Like [Am]desperados waiting for a [F]train[Am]   [Dm]   [G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
A [C]day before he died I went to see him [A#7]    [Am]
[G7]I was grown and he was almost [Am]gone
So we just [F]closed our eyes and [Dm]dreamed us up a [C]kitchen[Am]
And [F]sang another [Dm]verse to that old [G7]song
Come on Jack that son of a guns are com[C]ing
Like [Am]desperados waiting for a [F]train
Like [Am]desperados waiting for a [F]train
Like [Am]desperados waiting for a [F]train
Like [Am]desperados waitin for a t[F]rain
{end_of_verse}
