[C]You've been [G7]in and out of every heart in [C]town

You've come a long way from the girl I used to [F]know
You've been [G7]in and out of every heart in [C]town

Though I see [G7]you only now and [C]then
Each new [D7]heart you break makes mine ache [G7]again
You keep [C]living like each [G7]day will be the [C]last
A [G7]heart that's been all building up a [C]past
A hundred times you found true love then turned it [F]down
You've been [G7]in and out of every heart in [C]town
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Though I see [G7]you only now and [C]then
Each new [D7]heart you break makes mine ache [G7]again
You've been [C]loved and lost by [G7]dozens just like [C]me
You're [G7]in and out of every heart you [C]see
The only heart you haven't broke you haven't [F]found
You've been [G7]in and out of every heart in [C]town
{end_of_verse}
