{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]It's knowing that your door is always open
And your path is free to [Dm]walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag
Rolled up and [G7]stashed behind your [C]couch
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And it's knowing I'm not shackled by forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried if on some [Dm]line
That keeps you in the back-roads
By the rivers of my memory that keeps you ever [G7]gentle on my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy
Planted on the columns now that binds [Dm]me
Or something that somebody said
Because they [G7]thought we fit together [C]walking
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing
Or forgiving when I walk along some railroad track and [Dm]find 
That you are moving on the back-roads by the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just [G7]gentle on my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come [Dm]between us
And some other woman crying to her mother
Cause she [G7]turned and I was [C]gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
I still might run in silence tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm [Dm]blind
But not to where I cannot see you walking on the back-roads
By the rivers flowing [G7]gentle on my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
I dip my cup of soup back from the gurgling 
Crackling caldron in some train [Dm]yard
My beard a roughning coal pile and
A dirty hat [G7]pulled low across my [C]face
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
Through cupped hands 'round a tin can
I pretend I hold you to my breast and [Dm]find
That you're waving from the back-roads
By the rivers of my memory ever smiling ever [G7]gentle on my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}
