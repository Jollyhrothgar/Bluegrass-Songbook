{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]She's just a [G]woman  a [C]hundred pounds of flesh and blood
Quick with a smile [G]warm with a touch for [D7]me
She's just a [G]woman  and not the least or the [C]most desired
But she sets one man's [G]heart on fire and it's [D7]me
That she wants to [G]please
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And in my [D7]eyes God never made a [C]more beautiful [G]girl
In my [D7]eyes there's no one more [C]lovely in all of the [G]world
And she [Em]looks at me at [B7]times with such sur[Em]prise[D7]   [C]  [Bm]
When she [Am]sees how special she [D7]is in my [G]eyes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]She's only [G]human  and she cries sometimes 
When she [C]looks in the mirror
And counts a new line that [G]seemed to appear over[D7]night
She's only [G]human  it's not she's vain she's [C]just afraid
That there'll come a time when [G]I'll turn away at the [D7]sight
But I swear that's not [G]right
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
And in my [D7]eyes she just grows [C]lovelier to [G]me
And in my [D7]eyes she's only [C]aging gracefu[G]lly
And a [Em]thousand strands on [B7]gray won't dis[Em]guise[D7]   [C]  [Bm]
The [Am]woman she'll always [D7]be in my [G]eyes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Sometimes she [Em]makes mistakes  but [D7]I'm aware of her faults
Her moods go [C]up and down  [D7]but that's just because
She's just a [G]woman and giving her love to [C]only me
Without her help [G]I would be less of a [D7]man
Than she thinks I [G]am
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
And in my [D7]eyes love never [C]changes or pre[G]tends
In my [D7]eyes her mystery [C]never [G]ends
And [Em]everything I [B7]feel as the years go [Em]by [D7]   [C]  [Bm]
[Am]Makes her love grow [D7]sweeter still in my [G]eyes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
In my eyes[A7]   [C]she is my [G]woman
{end_of_verse}
