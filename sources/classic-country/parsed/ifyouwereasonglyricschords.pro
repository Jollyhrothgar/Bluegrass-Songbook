{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Soft your fingers wipe away the [F]pain
So [C]warm like sunshine following the [F]rain
[Dm]Morning always comes too soon
And I [G7]still I won't to hear the tune [C]again
If you were a song I'd play you over [G7]and over [C]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Like the [F]music of a symphony it [Dm]rushes in to [G7]cover me and [C]then
Just [G7]when I think the music's gone you touch [F]me 
And I [G7]hear the song [C]again
Your fingers gently strum the [F]strings 
If [Dm]anyone can [G7]make me sing you [C]can
If you were a song I'd play you over [G7]and over [C]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Your words they always fit the [F]melody
Sweet [C]love like you were written just for [F]me
Your arms reach out to keep [Dm]the time
Your [G7]lips repeat the lines I [C]understand
If you were a song I'd play you over [G7]and over [C]again
