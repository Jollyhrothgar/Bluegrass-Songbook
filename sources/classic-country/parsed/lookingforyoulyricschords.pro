{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Well I look out of my window
When I'm [D7]looking for you
Looking for you sweetheart of [G]mine [D7]
When I [G]hear the doorbell ring
I'm [D7]hoping it's you
I'm wishing for you all the [G]time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[D7]Lonely the night [G]blue the day
I [D7]let my trusting heart get in the [G]way
So to[D7]day when I [G]look into a mirror
I [D7]see someone so blue
I see a lonesome fool with a troubled [G]mind[D7]
And [G]when I'm walking down the road
I keep [D7]looking back for you
I'm looking for you all the [G]time
{end_of_verse}
