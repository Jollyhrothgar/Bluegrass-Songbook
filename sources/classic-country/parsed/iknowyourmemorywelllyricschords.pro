{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]My eyes no longer [F]look for new [C]horizons
The [G7]future lost my interest years [C]ago
My heart has learned to [F]live without [C]surprises
So I’ll [G7]play it safe and stay with what I [C]know
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And I kn-[F]ow your memory [C]well
I know [G7]loving you was heaven
I [C]know losing you was hell
Like a blind man knows the [F]darkness
Like a [C]prisoner knows his [F]cell
I [C]know your [G7]memory [C]well
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Time sometimes [F]for me is hard to [C]measure
Cause [G7]I spend mine reliving yester[C]day
Where the line is thin be[F]tween the pain and [C]pleasure
But I [G7]walk that line with your memory every[C]day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And I kn-[F]ow your memory [C]well
I know [G7]loving you was heaven
I [C]know losing you was hell
Like a blind man knows the [F]darkness
Like a [C]prisoner knows his [F]cell
I [C]know your [G7]memory [C]well
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I know your [G7]memory [C]well
{end_of_verse}
