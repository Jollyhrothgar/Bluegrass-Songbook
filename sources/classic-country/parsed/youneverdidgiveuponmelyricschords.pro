I've been every kind of [G7]fool a man can [C]be

But some[C]how you never [G7]did give up on [C]me

When I couldn't beat the [F]world I struck at [C]you
In my hunger for [G7]things I didn't [C]need
When I could [F]neither break or [G7]bend 
You were [C]there to be my [F]friend
And some[C]how you never [G7]did give up on [C]me

And I'm proud to know God [F]gave me such a [C]woman

Without you my life would [F]only be a [C]ruin
But somehow you never [G7]did give up on [C]me
