{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[D7]I'm just a [G]penny that fell [F] from a [C]hole in your pocket
[G]And clattered to the gutter [D7]at your feet
[G]I'm like a puppet [F]  on a broken [C]string
Who [G]lies completely helpless [D7]in a heap
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Just a [G]hopeful heart standing in line
[F]Hoping you might [C]need me sometime
[G]If you do you might call [D7]my name
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G]But from now on I [F]guess I'll always be [C]that something
[Am]You saved for a [D7]rainy day that [G]never came
[C]Cause you've got sunshine[A7]   and fields of clover
[Am]But I feel so useless [D7] now that it's over
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[G]You never said you'd leave me[F]  or that you [C]didn't love me
[G]And I guess you're gonna keep me [D7]on a string
[G]So from now on I [F]guess I'll always be [C]that something
[Am]You saved for a [D7]rainy day that [G]never came
{end_of_verse}
