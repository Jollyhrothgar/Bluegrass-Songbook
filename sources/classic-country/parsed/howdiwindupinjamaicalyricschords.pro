[G]Sign said [D7]cold beer I pulled in [G]there 
Pulled up [D7]a chair to have just [G]one
Now my [D7]head hurts got this sun [G]burn 
[C]Oh what on earth [D7]have I [G]done
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
How'd I [C]wind up in Ja[G]maica 
Washed [D7]up like some lost cast [G]away
How did [C]one round of beer lead to [Bm]me laying [E7]here
On this [Am]bed of sand in [D7]Montego [G]Bay
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[D7]Hey don't I know you ain't you the girl [G]who
I was [D7]talking to back at the [G]bar
Your dress was [D7]light green and I had on [G]blue jeans
Tell me [C]what's it mean when we [D7]don't know where we [G]are
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
How'd I [C]wind up in Ja[G]maica 
Was it [D7]your wild hair or was it [G]mine
Oh I [C]barely remember you [Bm]cussing De[E7]cember
As you [Am]passed me that [D7]salt and the [G]lime
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
It's [D7]been a year now we're still [G]here now
All settled [D7]down might not go back [G]again
Like a couple of beach [D7]bums we hardly [G]work much
Still [C]ask each other [D7]every now and [G]then
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
How'd we [C]wind up in Ja[G]maica 
Was it [D7]your wild hair or was it [G]mine
Oh who [C]cares it don't matter we're [Bm]happy ever [E7]after
{end_of_verse}

Now [Am]pass me that [D7]salt and the [G]lime
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
Got it [C]made here in Ja[G]maica 
Wouldn't [D7]have it any other [G]way
To this [C]day it ain't clear all I [Bm]know is we're [E7]here
On this [Am]bed of sand in [D7]Montego [G]Bay
{end_of_verse}
