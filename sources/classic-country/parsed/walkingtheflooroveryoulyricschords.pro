{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]You left me and [E7]you went [A7]away
[D7]You said that you'd be back in just a [G]day
You've [E7]broken your promise and you left me here [A7]alone
I [D7]don't know why you did dear but I do know that you're [G]gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Chorus:
I'm walking the floor over [A7]you
I [D7]can't sleep a wink that is [G]true
I'm [E7]hoping and I'm praying as my [A7]heart breaks right in two
[D7]Walking the floor over [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now darling [E7]you know I love you [A7]well
[D7]Love you more than I can ever [G]tell
I [E7]thought that you loved me and always would be [A7]mine
[D7]But you went and left me here with troubles on my [G]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Repeat Chorus
Now someday you [E7]may be lonesome [A7]too
[D7]Walking the floor is good for [G]you
[E7]Just keep right on walking and it won't hurt you to [A7]cry
[D7]Remember that I love you and I will the day I [G]die
