{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Will I [F]ever get used to being [G7]your old used to [C]be
I watched you walk away from me so [C7]long [F]ago
I [G7]didn't know I loved you when I let you [C]go
And just to think that I'm the one who set [C7]you [F]free
Will I ever get used to being [G7]your old used to [C]be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I've [D7]gotten used to people's stares as I walk [G7]by
I [D7]keep my head bowed low so they can't see me [G7]cry
They [C]say there goes a man who lives in a [F]memory
Will I ever get used to being [G7]your old used to [C]be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I've got no one to help me pass [C7]these lonely [F]days
When [G7]night time comes I just can't keep the blues [C]away
Or if I dream your lovely face is [C7]all I [F]see
Will I ever get used to being [G7]your old used to [C]be
