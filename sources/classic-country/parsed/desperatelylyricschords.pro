{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]My heart is out of control
This ole [F]love struck [C]soul
Just lives for the moment you're [G7]around
When I hold on to [C]you
It is [F]all I can [C]do 
Just to keep my feet [G7]on the [C]ground
[G7][F]Desperately [C]Loving you [C][F]desperately
When you're not [F]here with [C]me
I get a little bit [G7]crazy
[G7][F]Constantly [C]I think about you [C][F]constantly
Look at what you've [F]done to [C]me
I'm just like a little [G7]baby
[F]Oh I love you [C][G7]desperately
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Will I laugh will I cry
Will I [F]live will I [C]die
It all depends upon [G7]you
And it is dangerous I [C]know
To be [F]lost in you [C]so
But I am and there's [G7]nothing I can [C]do
[G7][F]Desperately [C]Loving you [C][F]desperately
When you're not [F]here with [C]me
I get a little bit [G7]crazy
