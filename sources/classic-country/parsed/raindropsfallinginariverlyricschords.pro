{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Raindrops falling in a [C]river
[D7]Swallowed up and lost at [G]sea
As my love for you has [C]vanished
Like [D7]raindrops in a raging [G]stream
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]A raindrop is nothing to a [G]river
[A7]And my love means nothing to [D7]you
           g                   C
Cause it's lost like many tiny raindrops
That [D7]fall into a river [G]blue
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Raindrops will go back to the [C]heavens
[D7]The river will someday join the [G]sea
But my heart will never find a [C]harbor
Caught [D7]up in a whirlpool of lost [G]dreams
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]Raindrops falling in the [G]river
[A7]Tears are falling from my [D7]eyes
I [G]mean no more to you [C]darling
And [D7]raindrops falling from the [G]sky
{end_of_verse}
