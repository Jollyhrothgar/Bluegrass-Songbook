There's an Old Christmas Card in an old [C]dusty [G]trunk
And it [D7]brings back sweet memories dear to [G]me

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I [D7]thrill with every word every [G]line

Pardon [G]me if a tear  falls [C]among my Christmas [G]cheer
It's the [D7]memory of an Old Christmas [G]Card
spoken:

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
You know I don't know why I get to feeling sentimental
About this time every year
But every time I see a Christmas card
I somehow can't help reminiscing
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
About the very first Christmas that you and I spent together
What a beautiful Christmas card you gave me that year
Why I know you must have looked through thousands of cards
To find that wonderful poem that still brings a tear to my eyes
