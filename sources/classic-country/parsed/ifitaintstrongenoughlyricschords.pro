{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I'd swim the wide Missouri with a rope tied around my neck
I'd cross the state of [C]Texas a [D7]hoppin' on one [G]leg
If that ain't strong enough
There ain't [D7]no such thing called [G]love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I'd sleep in a den full of mountain lions 
And wrestle with a grizzly bear
I'd travel round the [C]world three times 
On the [D7]back of an ole gray [G]mare
If that ain't strong enough 
There ain't [D7]no such thing called [G]love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]No more hopeless feelin's and no more dreamin' alone
[G]All my cold and rainy days are gone
[C]Wakin' up each morning with a happy sing along song
Be[A7]cause your good sweet lovin' turns me [D7]on
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
There ain't no [G]place in the world that I won't go 
Or a thing that I won't do
I'm always ready and a [C]waitin' here 
Just to [D7]prove my love for [G]you
If that ain't strong enough 
There ain't [D7]no such thing called [G]love
{end_of_verse}
