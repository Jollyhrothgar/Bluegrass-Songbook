{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I walk into the kitchen the silver ware is gone
The furniture is missin' I guess you got it all
Uh [F]huh this is where it oughta [C]hurt
Seems like [G7]every time you leave me 
You [F]try to think of somethin' [C]worse
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I can't even get the [F]blues no more 
I try to worry like [C]I did before
And nothin' happens when I [G7]walk the floor 
So what am I supposed to [C]do
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I toss and turn but then I [F]fall asleep 
I'm going under but it's [C]not too deep
You wanna hurt me but it's [G7]just no use 
[F]I can't even get the [C]blues
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
This time ain't no different no sun up in the sky
Sittin' on the back porch clouds are rolling by
Un [F]huh this is where it oughta [C]rain
But it [G7]doesn't really matter
[F]Pretty soon it's all about the [C]same
{end_of_verse}
