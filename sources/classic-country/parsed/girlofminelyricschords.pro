[G]When you're asleep beside me I watch you lying [Am]there
Your [Dm]hand upon the [D7]pillow and moonlight in your [G]hair
I get the warmest feeling so [G7]good I almost [C]cry
I kiss your sleeping [G]lips and say I'll [D7]love you till I [G]die

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh [Am]girl of [G]mine you make my day
One sunny [Dm]smile and [G]all the clouds just [C]roll away
Eyes deep as the [G]sea seem to say to [A7]me our love will always [D7]be
So girl of [G]mine turn out the lights
And in my [Dm]arms together we'll [G]make sweet [C]love tonight
Down life's golden [G]road and you'll always [D7]know I love you girl of [G]mine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Sometimes I know I hurt you when things ain't going [Am]right
I [Dm]walk away and [D7]leave you to face the lonely [G]night
I wouldn't blame you darling if [G7]you walked out on [C]me
But I return to [G]find you there [D7]still waiting patient[G]ly

So [Am]girl of [G]mine turn out the lights
