{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Heartbreaking daddy they [G7]call me
For seeds that I used to [C]sow
But those days have [C7]passed and I'm [F]paying
That was [C]just a [G7]heartbreak [C]ago
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
A [F]heartbreak ago the [C]sun was so bright
A [D7]heartbreak ago the [G7]moon shown at night
How [C]things have changed you'll [F]never never [C]know
That was just a [G7]heartbreak [C]ago
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Oh why did I treat her like [G7]dirt at my feet
That's why I'm feeling so [C]low
Too late I have found I was [C7]wrong from the [F]start
And was [C]just a [G7]heartbreak [C]ago
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
A [F]heartbreak ago the [C]sun was so bright
A [D7]heartbreak ago the [G7]moon shown at night
Now [C]things have changed you'll [F]never never [C]know
That was just a [G7]heartbreak [C]ago
{end_of_verse}
