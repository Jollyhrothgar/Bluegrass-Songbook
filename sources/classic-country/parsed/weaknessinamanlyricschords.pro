[G]Honey how you've changed it makes me wonder
[Am]Have I ever really known you
[D7]How could you abuse and use the kindness
[G]And tenderness I've shown you
{end_of_verse}

If I had known then I'd have shown the strength
[C]On which my love could make a stand
[D7]But you've mistaken tenderness and kindness
[G]For the weakness in a man

I can give you almost anything
[Am]If I know what you're looking for
[D7]I can give you everything
[G]That any other man can give and more

He may promise you the world
[C]But I can give you everything he can
[D7]So don't mistake my tenderness
[G]For any sign of weakness in your man

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I may live my life alone with walls
[Am]Of stone inside some lonely cell
[D7]But no man's gonna take the love I own
[G]And never live to tell the tale
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
So don't forsake the vows you made
[C]And don't remove my little golden band
[D7]And don't mistake my tenderness
[G]For any sign of weakness in your man
