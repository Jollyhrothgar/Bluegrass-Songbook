[G]The lights are dim and low in the [C]tavern 
As I [G]sit all alone with a heart that's [D7]lost
But the [G]laughing crowd don't know tears are ready to [C]flow
As I [G]listen to the Honky [D7]Tonk [G]Waltz

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
It's the [D7]same waltz we used to dance [G]together 
Now you're [D7]gone and I'll suffer [G]alone 
I'm so blue tonight while another holds you [C]tight 
And I [G]listen to the [D7]honky tonk [G]waltz
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
There's no use to go to my lonely [C]room 
I can't [G]sleep I'll just turn and [D7]toss 
So when the crowd [G]says goodbye I'll just sit here and [C]cry 
As I [G]listen to the Honky [D7]Tonk [G]Waltz 
{end_of_verse}
