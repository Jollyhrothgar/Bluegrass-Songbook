{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Don't say goodnight   like he would [G7]do
[C]Don't whisper low  I love you true
[C7]Like he would [F]do  as he held me [C]tight
[G7]Just kiss me soft  then say [C]goodnight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C7]Don't do the [F]things that remind me of [C]him
[G7]Though time has made the memory dim
[C]I still [F]recall  through bitter [C]tears
[G7]His love just left  me lonely [C]years
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G7]It isn't fair  to you are me
[C]Our love would be  just misery
[C7]My heart can't [F]stand  the things you [C]do
[G7]For I see him  instead of [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C7]If don't [F]change we'll have to [C]part
[G7]Though it will cause two broken hearts
[C]Love must be [F]strong  enough to [C]last
[G7]So I'll forget  about the [C]past
{end_of_verse}
