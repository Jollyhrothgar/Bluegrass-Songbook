{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I've played the games [D7]the masquerades 
By the [G]time the eleventh hour fades
[C]You're bound to know that what I say is [G]true [Am]   [D7]
[G]And I'm the one [D7]you're looking for 
Every [G]time you find that cheatin' door
[A7]I'll just keep pretending I never [D7]knew
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But what [C]are we in this [G]for [C]when our hearts are [G]on the line[C]
And if a [G]heart could break [C]you're surely breaking [G]mine [C]
And if we [G]fall to ruin [C]it wasn't by de[G]sig[F]n [C]
But if I can have my [Am]way there's no price I won't [D7]pay 
Just keep buying [G]time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I'll have to say [D7]I have my doubts 
But [G]I'll give [D7]all till [G]I give out
[C]And I'll do anything to make you [G]stay[Am]   [D7]
[G]But this could be [D7]part of the plan 
Maybe [G]we were dealt a losing hand
[A7]I'll have to let the cards fall where they [D7]may
{end_of_verse}
