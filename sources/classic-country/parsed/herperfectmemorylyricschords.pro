[C]Just take [G]a look at both of us and you tell me who [D7]won
[G]If she [D7]thinks I [G]hung the stars if [G7]that's what she [C]believes
[G]Then who am [C]I to tamper [G]with her perfect [G][D7]memory

[D7]You ought to hear her tell the kids how mom and [G]daddy met
[D7]It always amazes me the things that she [G]forgets

[G]How mommy looked in daddy's [C]eyes and I [G]stole [D7]away her [G]heart
