{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Just a mile west of the water tank [C]on a cold November day
In a cold and lonesome [G]boxcar a [D7]dyin' hobo lay
His [G]pal sat there before him with a [C]low and drooping head
Listenin' to the [G]last words his [D7]dyin' buddy [G]said
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Goodbye old partner hobo I [C]hate to say goodbye
But I hear my train a-[G]comin' and I [D7]know she's a-getting nigh
Gonna [G]tell that old conductor just [C]where I want to stop
Where the little stream of [G]whiskey comes [D7]flowing down the [G]rocks
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
We rode the rods together we've [C]rambled all around
In every kind of [G]weather we [D7]slept out on the ground
Oh [G]partner don't you miss that train [C]that always makes the stop
Where the little stream of [G]whiskey comes [D7]flowing down the [G]rocks
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Would you tell my girl in Danville that she [C]need not to worry at all
I'm a-goin' to that [G]country where I [D7]won't have to work a-tall
[G]No I will not have to work there nor [C]ever change my socks
And the little stream of [G]whiskey comes [D7]flowing down the [G]rocks 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I'm a-goin' to that better place where [C]everything is right
Where the handouts grow on [G]bushes and [D7]they sleep out ever' night
Won't [G]have to wash my overhauls nor [C]even change my socks
And the little stream of [G]whiskey comes [D7]flowing down the [G]rocks
{end_of_verse}
