{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Most of the time while I'm here [G7]cryin'
I think of how nice it would [C]be
If we two could be back dear again [G7]together
And forget the troubles that have set us [C]free
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C7]I think of [F]doin' things but I'd be [C]sorry
Like tryin' to find somebody [G7]new
I [C]think of lots of things to ease my [G7]sorrow
But most of the time I think of [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Most of the time I can't help [G7]wondering
It may be you're out with someone [C]new
You wouldn't if you knew how much it [G7]hurt me
When I think that someone else is holdin' [C]you [C7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[F]Most of the time I'm so [C]lonely
The rest of the time I'm so [G7]blue
Part [C]of my time I spend in [G7]slumber
But most of the time I think of [C]you
{end_of_verse}
