{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]You said you were loving me you said I could never see
[Dm]The forest for the [G7]trees where you're con[C]cerned
Just another game you've lost 
And just another stream you'll cross
And [Dm]just another [G7]bridge you'll have to [C]burn
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
So you're [F]on your way to [G7]Texas girl you're [F]Ama[G7]rillo [C]bound
You [F]told me when I [C]picked you up 
Someday you'd let me [G7]down
If you [F]ever think to [G7]write me if you [F]ever think to [C]call
[F]If you ever [G7]think of me at [C]all 
[F]If you ever [G7]think of me at [C]all
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
But you won't think about me much 
And you won't even miss my touch
And [Dm]you won't ever see [G7]my face at [C]night
You are so intent on losing 
That's the kind of life you're choosing
Now [Dm]you've got me [G7]much too weak to [C]fight
