{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Riding along in my automobile
My baby beside me at the wheel
Oh I stole a kiss at the turn of a [C]mile
My [G]curiosity runnin' wild
Cruisin' and playin' my [D7]radio
[C]Oh with no particular place to [G]go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh riding along in my automobile
Just anxious to tell her the way I feel
Ooh I told her softly and sincere
[C]Oh and she slowly whispered in my [G]ear
Cuddlin' more and drivin' [D7]slow
[C]Oh with no particular place to [G]go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Oh with no particular place to go
So we parked way out in the Kokomo
Ah the night was young and the moon was [C]gold
Ah we both [G]decided to take a stroll
Can you imagine the I [D7]felt
I [C]couldn't unfasten that doggone safety [G]belt
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Oh riding along in my calaboose
Ooh still trying to get her belt unloose
All the way home I held a [C]grudge
Ah but the safety belt it wouldn't [G]budge
Cruisin' and playin' my [D7]radio [C]
With no [D7]particular place to [G]go
{end_of_verse}
