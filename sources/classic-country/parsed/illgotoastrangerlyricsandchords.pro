{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G7]With someone else perhaps in time
[C]I'll find a little [D7]peace of [G7]mind
[C]And maybe [F]someday I'll [G7]get over [D7]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G7]And if in time [F]I hear your [G7]name
[C]It may be hard to bear the [G7]pain
[C]But I'll go to a stranger
[D7]Before I'll come [C]to [G7]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]For a stranger might [D7]show a little [G7]sympathy
[C]And that's so much more than [F]you
[D7]Have ever done for [C]me
[G7]And to [F]turn away from [G7]you
[C]Won't be an easy thing [G7]to do
[C]But I'll go to a stranger
[D7]Before I'll come to [C]you
