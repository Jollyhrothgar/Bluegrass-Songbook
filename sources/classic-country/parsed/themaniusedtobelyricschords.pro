{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I’m no hero [F]I'm no [C]saint
But in her eyes no man has ever
Stood [D7]so tall and [G7]straight
And I've always [C]wondered [F]what a woman [C]does
When she finally [F]sees her [C]man
Is not the [G7]man she thought he [C]was
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [F]never [C]was the [F]man I used to [C]be
Her loving eyes could only see
What she [D7]wanted him to [G7]see
She saw a [C]knight in shinning armor
But [F]Lord he wasn’t [C]me
I [F]never [C]was the [G7]man I used to [C]be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now she tells me [F]I've really [C]changed
And the disappointment on her face
[D7]Almost makes me [G7]ashamed
I try to [C]tell her [F]I'm still just [C]me
And I never [F]was the [C]man she [G7]thinks I used to [C]be
{end_of_verse}
