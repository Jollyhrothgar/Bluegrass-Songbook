[C]She loved him most when his eyes were gray 
The palest shade of a winter day
They filled her with a raging fire 
And a bitter[G7]sweet [C]desire
{end_of_verse}

She shined for him like candlelight 
That softly beckons in the night
But he said no right to her face 
Then simply turned [G7]and walked [C]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
All heaven [G7]watched from way on [C]high 
True love [F]given and de[C]nied
And while her [G7]heart was broke and [C]bleed[F]ing 
Sorrowful [C]angels [G7]wept into their [C]wings
{end_of_verse}

She wore him like a lock and chain 
Only in dreams she spoke his name
By day it slipped upon her tongue 
The taste of un[G7]requited [C]love
{end_of_verse}

Now her hair is long and gray 
The palest shade of a winter day
She never took a ring of gold 
She swears she never [G7]loved a [C]soul

All heaven [G7]watched from way on [C]high

Sorrowful [C]angels [G7]wept into their [C]wings
