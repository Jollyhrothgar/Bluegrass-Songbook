{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]There was a time when you were mine and [C]my heart knew no pain
But [D7]since that time sweetheart I find there's been an awful [G]change
The love I knew has proved untrue and [C]now we're far apart
No [D7]matter how you treat me now you'll still be in my [G]heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I understand your many plans I [C]brought you wealth and pride
With [D7]all your gold when love is cold you'll be dis-satis[G]fied
You were untrue because you knew I [C]loved you from the start
Though [D7]you find bliss in another's kiss you'll still be in my [G]heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I can't erase the lovely face no [C]matter how I try
When [D7]friends we knew just mention you I hang my head and [G]cry
You turned me down because you found you [C]play the leadin' part
Those [D7]lonely years I'll spend in tears you'll still be in my [G]heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
My one request when I lay to rest the [C]future has in store
On [D7]that sad day beneath the clay to sleep forever [G]more
Should you be there in deep despair when [C]burning teardrops start
Please [D7]don't forget I love you yet you'll still be in my [G]heart 
{end_of_verse}
