[G]It's so nice to meet an old friend and [C]pass the time of day
And [D7]talk about the hometown a million miles [G]away
Is the ice still on the river are the [C]old folks still the same
And by the [D7]way did she mention my [G]name
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Did she [C]mention my [D7]name just in [G]passing
And when the morning came do you [A7]remember if she cried a tear or [D7]two
Is the [G]home team still on fire do they [C]still win all their games
And by the [D7]way did she mention my [G]name
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Is the landlord still a loser do his [C]signs hang in the hall
Are the [D7]young girls still as pretty in the city in the [G]fall
Does the laughter on their faces still [C]put the sun to shame
And by the [D7]way did she mention my [G]name
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Did she [C]mention my [D7]name just in [G]passing
And when the talk ran high did the [A7]look in her eyes seem far [D7]away
Won't you [G]say hello from someone there'll [C]be no need to explain
And by the [D7]way did she mention my [G]name
Oh by the [D7]way did she mention my [G]name 
{end_of_verse}
