{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Turn [D7]around don’t whisper out my [G]name
For like a [D7]breeze it might [C]stir a dyin’ [G]flame
I’ll miss [D7]someone if it eases you to [G]know
So [C]close the door [D7]lightly when you [G]go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]Take your [D7]tears to someone else’s [G]eyes
They’re made of [D7]glass and they [C]cut like wounding [G]lies
Memo[D7]ries are drifting like the [G]snow
So [C]close the door [D7]lightly when you [G]go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]Who was the [D7]one who wasted [G]time
[C]Who was the [D7]one who stole my [G]mind
[C]Who was the [D7]one who made me feel [G]unkind
So [C]fare thee well [D7]sweet love of [G]mine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[D7]Don’t look back to where you once had [G]been
Look straight [D7]ahead if you’re [C]walking in the [G]rain
And find a [D7]life if the path is dark and [G]cold
And [C]close the door [D7]lightly when you [G]go
{end_of_verse}
