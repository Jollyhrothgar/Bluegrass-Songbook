{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[D7]The [G]first time I [D7]heard about [G]heaven
Momma was [D7]smiling and [G]rockin' my cradle and singin'
Won't it be wonderful the[F]re
I can [C]still see her happy tears a-[G]fallin'[Em]
And I can [G]still hear my [C]mother in [G]prayer[D7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Now [G]if the [D7]walls are not of [G]jasper
And if the [D7]streets are not [G]gold[G7]
If my [C]mansion should just be a [G]cabin
As [A7]long as it's heaven it's [D7]home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The [G]only thing my [D7]eyes long to [G]vision
The only thing my [B7]heart needs to [C]know[G]
Is that [C]somewhere on the hills of Mount [G]Zion[Em]
The [G]King is sittin' [C]high on His [G]thron[C]e
The [G]King is sittin' [C]high on His [G]throne[D7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Now [G]if there is [D7]no marriage [G]supper
No gathering of [D7]millions to [G]feast at the table no singin'
Saved by His marvelous gra[F]ce
So my [C]soul would be fed and [G]contented[Em]
If my [G]eyes should be[C]hold His sweet [G]face[D7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Now [G]if the [D7]walls are not of [G]jasper

If my [C]mansion should just be a [G]cabin
As [A7]long as it's heaven it's [D7]home
