{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]There's a ship lies rigged and [G7]ready in the [C]harbor
Tomorrow for old England she [F]sails
Far away from your land of endless sunshine
To my land full of [Dm]rainy skies and [G7]gales
And [C]I shall be [G7]aboard that ship [C]tomorrow
Though my heart is full of tears at this [F]farewell[Dm]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
For [G7]you are [Em]beauti[Am]ful [Dm]I have loved you [G7]dearly
More [Dm]dearly than the [G7]spoken word can [C]tell[Dm]
For [G7]you are [Em]beauti[Am]ful [Dm]I have loved you [G7]dearly
More [Dm]dearly than the [G7]spoken word can [C]tell

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I've heard that there's a [G7]wicked war a-[C]blazing
And the taste of war I know so very [F]well
Even now I see the foreign flag a-raising
Their guns on fire [Dm]as we sail into [G7]hell
I [C]have no fear of [G7]death it brings no [C]sorrow
But how bitter will be this last [F]farewell[Dm]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Though death and darkness [G7]gather all a[C]round me
And my ship be torn apart upon the [F]seas
I shall smell again the fragrance of these islands
That I return home [Dm]safe again to [G7]ye 
And when [C]I get back [G7]again to good old [C]England    
I shall watch the English mist roll through the [F]dale[Dm]
