[C]I walked into a tavern it was cheap and [G7]small
[F]With an ancient sign and jukebox that leaned against the [C]wall

[G7]When I asked if she was lonely she [C]replied

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G7]Drop some silver in the jukebox and I'll dance with you
[F]Though there's other guys around here much handsomer than [C]you
[C7]But you seem like a good guy so I'll give you first [F]chance
[G7]Drop some silver in the jukebox and we'll [C]dance

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G7]So I fed the silent jukebox just to dance with her
[F]And she played the longest saddest songs that I've ever [C]heard

[G7]And she threw that same ol' message back to [C]me

[G7]She shoved that same ol' message in my [C]face
