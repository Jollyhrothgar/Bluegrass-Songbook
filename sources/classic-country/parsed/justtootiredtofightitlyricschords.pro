{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Here comes [G]that same old memory 
Like a [C]movie in my mind
You told [G]me you loved another 
Then you [Am]drove off through the [D7]pines
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And I [G]swear it feels like yesterday

I can [G]still feel those cold chills 
Running [D7]up and [C]down my [G]spine

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And I've been [C]fightin' back the memories 
I've been [G]fightin' back the tears
And I'm [C]fightin' back the hurt 
I still feel [G]after all these years
If I [Em]had the strength I'd fight 
To make things [C]like they were before
But I'm [G]just too tired to [D7]fight it [C]any[G]more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]Every[G]day my heart reminds me 
How I [C]boldly spoke those lines
I can [G]get along without you 
And I'm [Am]gonna be just [D7]fine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
But the [G]nights alone grew colder 
Than I [C]ever thought they'd be
And I spend [G]every hour searching 
For what you [D7]took [C]out of [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And I've been [C]fightin' back the memories 
I've been [G]fightin' back the tears
And I'm [C]fightin' back the hurt 
I still feel [G]after all these years
If I [Em]had the strength I'd fight 
To make things [C]like they were before
But I'm [G]just too tired to [D7]fight it [C]any[G]more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
I thought [Em]time would overcome the [C]torture
But [Em]instead I'm getting [C]weaker every [D7]day yeah yeah
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
[G]And I've been [C]fightin' back the memories 
I've been [G]fightin' back the tears
And I'm [C]fightin' back the hurt 
I still feel [G]after all these years
If I [Em]had the strength I'd fight 
To make things [C]like they were before
But I'm just [G]too tired to [C]fight  
There ain't [G]no way to [C]hide it 
I'm [G]just too tired to [D7]fight it [C]any[G]more
