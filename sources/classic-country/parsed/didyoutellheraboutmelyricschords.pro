{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Now you have found a new love and you say that we are [D7]through
[G]You say she is the only one that could ever be for you
[D7]You're telling her the same thing that you once told only me
[G]And I wonder oh my darling did you tell her about me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]Did you talk about the vows you broke the marriage we had [G]planned
[A7]Did you tell her how you left me here without a wedding [D7]band
[G]When you kiss her lips I wonder was your mind and conscience [D7]free
[G]When you first told her you love her did you tell her about me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[D7]Now I could do some talking and the things that I could tell
[G]Could make her stop and wonder does she know you very well
[D7]If she knew you like I do I wonder what her thoughts would be
[G]Would she still love you just the same if you told her about me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]Would she be afraid to love you would she trust you with her [G]heart
[A7]If she knew the way you treated me and tore my dreams [D7]apart
[G]Does she think she is your first love and is your wife to [D7]be
[G]When you first told her you love her did you tell her about me
{end_of_verse}
