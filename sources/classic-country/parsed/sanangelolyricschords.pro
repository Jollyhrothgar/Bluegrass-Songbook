{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]North of the border of Old Mexico
I rode one day to the cow town of San An[D7]gelo
A hot sun was glowing a warm wind was blowing
Still not as warm as the lips that I waited to [G]kiss
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Cheeks that put blushing red roses to shame
Lips that were fresher than flowers when kissed by the [D7]rain
Dark eyes that sparkled much brighter than diamonds
She was a beauty Secora was my lover's [G]name
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]I met her down in Laredo
Everyone there in this border town called her the [G]rose
Mexican cowboys drank to Secora
Everyone loved her but I was the one that she [C]chose
An [D7]outlaw above all the [G]rest now my heart beats so [D7]madly
Soon she will be at my [G]side
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
She sent a message a long time ago
Secora had promised to meet me in San An[D7]gelo
I was aware of the chance I was taking
I was an outlaw but great was my love for this [G]girl
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I must be with her I can't stay away
Nights spent without her are lonely and so are the [D7]days
If it means death then I'll have to chance it
Only a few moments more and she'll be in my [G]arms
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
[C]At ten o'clock in the morning
I tied my horse and I started to walk down the [G]street
Where was Secora had she forgotten
This was the day and the hour that she wanted to [C]meet
But [D7]something is wrong with our [G]plans and I fear death [D7]awaits me
Here on this hot dusty [G]street
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Up on a housetop but still I can see
There hides a man with the rifle it's pointed at [D7]me
I might escape from the man with the rifle
But there are others just like him that I cannot [G]see
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
Back of each window the click of a gun
Die if I stay and my love for her won't let me [D7]run
Where is Secora will my eyes see her
Then in a moment she runs from her door down the [G]street
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 9}
[C]Up on your horse she is crying
Ride out of town it's a trap and they're waiting for [G]you
But if I ride out she must ride with me
Then in a moment I know that our chances are [C]gone
For a [D7]bullet is well on its [G]way and it finds my [D7]Secora
She dies as she falls in my [G]arms
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 10}
Tears dim my vision but plainly I see
The ranger that killed her is standing there waiting for [D7]me
I walk to meet him my one thought is beat him
He deserves death and I swear that this ranger will [G]die
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 11}
[C]I beat his draw and I shot him
Shot him six times just as fast as the bullets would [G]fly
My gun is empty or more I would shoot him
Now there are others just like him that want me to [C]die
Their [D7]bullets are coming my [G]way how they hurt when they [D7]hit me
The pain makes me fall to the [G]ground
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 12}
Gone is my strength just the will left to fight
I hear the sound of the lead as it robs me of [D7]life
If I must die let me find Secora
Let me hold on to her hand for the few moments [G]left
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 13}
Blindly I search and it isn't in vain
I touch the soft velvet hand and it eases the [D7]pain
Life is no more but we're together
Even in death she's my lover it's over good[G]bye
{end_of_verse}
