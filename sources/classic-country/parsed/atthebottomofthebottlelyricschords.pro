[C]At the bottom of the bottle is where a man can [F]hide
When he [C]must cross a river he [D7]knows is too [G7]wide
When the bottle [C]is empty even heartaches are [F]gone
Though his [C]eyes can't see no one he [G7]don't feel [C]alone

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Come go with me to the bottom of the [F]bottle
On our [C]way down we may meet fond [G7]memories
I talk [C]better from the bottom of the [F]bottle
Come join the [C]man who she [G7]left so [C]helplessly
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
They all tell me that last night my baby came [F]in
And she [C]walked to my table to [D7]forgive me [G7]again
My [C]eyes caught a memory and my mind tried in [F]vain
I said your [C]face looks familiar but I [G7]can't call your [C]name
