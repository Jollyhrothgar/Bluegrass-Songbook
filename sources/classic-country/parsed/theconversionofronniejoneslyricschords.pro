{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Ronnie Jones decided to settle down 
So he married Annie [F]Birch
Now [G7]Annie hadn't been around too much 
She mostly only went to [C]church
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Right away she started insistin' 
That he come on up and [F]join
He said [G7]I'll tell you what I'll do 
To settle this by dog I'll flip a [C]coin
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Preacher used some fancy words 
That Ronnie tried his best to under[F]stand
Cause he [G7]loved his little Annie 
And for her he wanted to be a better [C]man
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
But of all the things they told him 
It seemed that he remembered only [F]one
He said [G7]I guess I'll have to go up there 
And tell 'em everything I've [C]done
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
The Sunday meeting just took up 
And Ronnie stood outside half scared to [F]death
Re[G7]grettin' what he had to do in there 
And tried hard to get his [C]breath
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
There didn't seem to be much use 
To put off what he had to do no [F]more
So he [G7]backed way up and took a run 
And bolted through the double lobby [C]door
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Annie's eyes began to overflow 
In tears of joy at what she [F]saw
The [G7]preacher took him by the hand 
And said bless you my boy tell it [C]all
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
While every head was bowed in prayer 
Some women slipped outside as if to [F]pray
[G7]Fearin' what the spirit might cause 
Ronnie and his circumstance to [C]say
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 9}
All their fears were justified 
His simple life became an open [F]book
[G7]Names like Doris Cunningham 
Wanda Webb even Marlene [C]Cook
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 10}
Another kind of fire began to burn down 
In the depths of Annie's [F]soul
She [G7]turned on Ron and used some words 
Nobody'd ever heard her say [C]before
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 11}
Sometimes we know [G7]not what we pray [C]for
{end_of_verse}
