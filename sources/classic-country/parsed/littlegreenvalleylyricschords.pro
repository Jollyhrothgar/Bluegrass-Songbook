{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I see a candlelight [F]down in the little green [C]valley
Where Morning [G7]Glory vines are twining round my [C]door
[G7]Oh how I wish I were there [C]again
[F]Down in the little green [C]valley
That's where my [G7]homesick heart will trouble me no [C]more     
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
There's only one [F]thing ever gives me [C]consolation
And that's the thought that I'll be going back [G7]someday
And every night down upon my [C]knees
[F]I pray the Lord to please take [C]me
Back to that [G7]little old green valley far [C]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I hear a mockingbird [F]down in the little green [C]valley
He's singing [G7]out a song of welcome just for [C]me
[G7]And someone waits by the garden [C]gate
[F]Down in the little green [C]valley
When I get [G7]back again how happy she will [C]be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
And by a [F]little babbling brook once more we'll [C]wander
And in a shady nook we'll dream the hours [G7]away
And I will leave all my cares [C]behind
[F]Go where I know I'll find [C]sunshine
Back to that [G7]little old green valley far [C]away
{end_of_verse}
