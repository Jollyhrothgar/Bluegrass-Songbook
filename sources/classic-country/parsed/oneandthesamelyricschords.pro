[C]There's something about the way she skips [Em]across the room
Pretending [C]she's the little girl she was [A7]yesterday
And [Dm]I'm tempted for a fleeting minute 
[A7]Just to take her little hand
And [Dm]run outside with her so we can [C]play[G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But [C]then she comes and sits beside me
Gently puts her arms around me and [F]whispers my [Dm]name[F]
And [Dm]I'm so richly [G7]blessed because
[Dm]My little girl the [G7]woman [Dm]    [G7]are one and the [C]same
{end_of_verse}

She's still a little girl enough that [Em]every now and then
She'll blush [C]over some small something that I [A7]say 
Then [Dm]she lights the room by smiling [A7]and I know
She realizing [Dm]big girls aren't supposed to [Em]blush that way
{end_of_verse}

And [C]life's worth more than holding it 
Cause the love my woman's giving is [G7]more than a [Dm]little girls [F]game
And I love holding [G7]her because 
[Dm]My little girl that [G7]woman [Dm]    [G7]are one and the [C]same
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
To find a woman with a child like [A7]faith 
Has been more than worth the [G7]waitin[Dm]g
If [D7]everyone could love the way she loves me 
Couldn't find the time for [Dm]hatin[G7]g
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
And [C]I'm so glad she didn't find [Em]somewhere along the line
That growing up means more than getting [A7]old

And [Dm]she just never did discover 
[A7]Sometimes people hurt each other
[Dm]Cause grownup people sometimes [Em]grow so cold

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
And [C]when the years come to an end 
I know I'll find once again
[F]Time has not let her [Dm]chang[F]e 
[Dm]I still love [G7]both of her 
[Dm]My little girl that [G7]woman [Dm]
[G7]Are one and the [C]same
{end_of_verse}
