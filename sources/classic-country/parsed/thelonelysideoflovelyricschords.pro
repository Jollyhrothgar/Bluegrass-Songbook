[C]I can't make these heartaches go away [F]he's always [G7]on my [C]mind
The memories of the love we had [D7]don't fade away with [G7]time
What [C]is this crazy road I'm on [F]I don't under[C]stand
What [F]makes two people [C]fall in love 
[F]What good's a promise when the [C]love is gone
[F]Where do you go when you [C]find yourself on the [G7]lonely side of [C]love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The rain is fallin' to the ground [F]the neon [G7]rainbows [C]glow
I see us standing far away [D7]where peaceful waters [G7]flow
It's the [C]only dream that I have left [F]that I can hold on [C]to
Now [F]am I right or [C]am I wrong [F]for holding on to [C]what is gone
[F]And what's left to [C]believe in on the [G7]lonely side of [C]love
