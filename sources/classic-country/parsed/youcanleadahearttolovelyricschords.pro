[G]It was [C]love at first sight when I [G]looked into his eyes
He [D7]didn't feel the same no [G]matter how I tried
As the [C]nights went slowly by I sat [G]waitin' by the phone
I [D7]realized I'd fallen in [G]alone [C]  [G]

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Half [C]crazy in love not [G]knowin' where to turn
Too [D7]afraid to jump from a [G]bridge you couldn't burn
Though the [C]ships kept driftin' by with the [G]love that'd set her free
My [D7]broken heart just wouldn't let me [G]see [C]  [G]

It was [C]love at first sight when he [G]looked into my eyes
But [D7]I couldn't feel the same no [G]matter what he tried

[D7]Soon he'll learn what I already [G]knows
