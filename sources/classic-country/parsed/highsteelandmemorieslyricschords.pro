{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]The boss man and the boys
Down at the [C]job have been [D7]lettin' me slide [G]by [D7]   [G]
And this old [Am]hard hat that I'm wearin'
Can't [D7]hide the tears falling from my [G]eyes[D7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
While I'm [G]hanging steel in Dallas
[C]Forty floors [D7]above Park Ave[G]nue [D7]    [G]
From up [Am]here things look just like toys
And I [D7]realize how much I meant to [G]you [D7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well I [G]might move out to Denver
A [C]city that's al[D7]ready one mile [G]high[D7]
I [Am]lie a lot about leaving
And the [D7]boys all know I'm not afraid to [G]climb
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
So I'll just stay here in Dallas
[C]Chained to the [D7]place you set me [G]free[D7]   [G]
Cause [Am]loving you is forever
But [D7]having you is a thing that just can't [G]be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Your memory [C]climbs
High steel in the [G]sky
These days I [A7]just don't care
If [Am]I live or di[D7]e
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
I [G]just threw down a Winston
Watched it [C]fall 'til [D7]it was out of [G]sight[D7]   [G]
Then your [Am]memory hit me in the chest
And I [D7]wondered how it would feel to [G]fly
{end_of_verse}
