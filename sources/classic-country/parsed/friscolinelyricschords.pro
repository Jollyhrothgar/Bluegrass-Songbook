[C]I boarded that [F]big dog out in [C]Dallas

Where [Dm]jobs are waiting and [F]all the people are [C]kind 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Nothing but the [F]clothes [C]on my body
Swapped my coat for a bottle of ruby red [G7]wine
[F]And nothing now but a life of [C]shadow[Am]s
Ah [Dm]but get along [F]out on the Frisco [C]Line
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The sidewalks [F]sleep mighty hard in [C]Louisiana
And the night winds blow cold in [G7]Tennessee 
And [F]nothing to do but [C]find me a bottl[Am]e 
[Dm]Drown my troubles [F]out on the Frisco [C]Line
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Oh the sweet taste of [F]wine [C]clouds my mind now
And I must have got off way before my [G7]turn
And [F]it's to end in old [C]Albuquerqu[Am]e
An [Dm]empty bottle and the [F]end of the Frisco [C]Line
{end_of_verse}
