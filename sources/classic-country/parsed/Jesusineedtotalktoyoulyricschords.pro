[C]Last night my little boy knelt [F]down beside his [C]bed 
He put his hands together [D7]then he bowed his [G7]head 
He said [C]Jesus up in Heaven I [F]need to talk to [C]You 
My momma always said You'd [G7]know what to [C]do 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]I just don't understand why [F]mom was called a[C]way 
But Daddy said that we will [D7]understand some[G7]day 
But [C]since my momma's gone oh [F]things are not the [C]same 
Sometimes at night I hear [G7]daddy call her [C]name

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Please tell my momma [F]that I'm being [C]good 
I'm doing all the things [D7]that she said I [G7]should

And each night before supper I [G7]wash my face and [C]hands

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Please tell my momma [F]that I miss her [C]so 
And oh how I love her but [D7]this You already [G7]know

Jesus I feel better [G7]when I talk to [C]You

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[C]Well I just stood there in the hallway with [F]tears running down my [C]cheeks
My little boy crawled into bed and [D7]soon was fast a[G7]sleep

And I said Jesus up in Heaven I [G7]need to talk to [C]You
