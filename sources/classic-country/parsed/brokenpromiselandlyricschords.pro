{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]There's a Bible on the [Dm]dresser and a [G]sign hung on the [C]door
And a [Am]woman in my [D7]arms shouldn't [G]be [Am]
[D7]I'm to the [G]point of no [D7]returning but [Em]I've been [G]here be[C]fore [A7]
This [D7]cheating life is [Em]nothing [D7]new to [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[D7]There's [G]someone to be [D7]considered I [G]call her on the [C]phone
And [Am]say the job is taking [D7]longer [C]than I [G]planned [Am]
[D7]I don't [G]have the heart to [D7]tell her that a [Em]stranger's [G]turned me [C]on
And I'm [D7]heading for the [Em]broken [D7]promise [C]land
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Tonight I'm crossing [C]over and I'll [D7]reach the cheating [Em]side
And I'll [G]hate myself for [D7]coming here [Am]again
[G]Where the streets are paved with [C]misery and [D7]lives are built on [Em]lies
A [G]place they call the [D7]broken promise [C]land
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Found a [G]note left on the [D7]dresser and a [C]key left in the door
On the [D7]floor I found her [C]golden wedding [G]band
Guess she finally had to [D7]tell me she's not [C]waiting anymore
And she's [D7]heading for the [C]broken promise [G]land
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Tonight she's crossing [C]over and she'll [D7]reach the cheating [Em]side
[G]And I'll hate myself for [D7]giving her the [Am]chance
Where the [G]streets are paved with [C]misery and [D7]lives are built on [Em]lies
A [G]place they call the [D7]broken promise [C]land
[G]And it's more than I can [C]stand
