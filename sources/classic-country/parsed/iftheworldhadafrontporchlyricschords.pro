{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]It was where my momma sat on that old [G7]swing with her [C]crochet
It was [Am]where granddaddy [C]taught me how to cuss and how to [G7]pray
It was [Am]where we made our [Em]own ice cream those [F]sultry summer [C]nights
Where the [Dm]bulldog had her [Em]puppies and us [F]brothers had our [G7]fights
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
There were [C]many nights I'd sit right there and [G7]look out at the [C]stars 
To the [Am]sound of a distant [C]whippoorwill or the hum of a passin' [G7]car
It was [Am]where I first got [Em]up the nerve to [F]steal me my first [C]kiss 
And it was [Dm]where I learned to [Em]play guitar and [F]pray I had the [G7]gift
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
If the [C]world had a [F]front porch [G7]like we did back [Am]then
[F]We'd still have our [C]problems [G7]but we'd all be friends 
[Am]Treatin' your [G7]neighbor like he's [F]your next of [C]kin
[F]Wouldn't be [C]gone with the [Am]wind 
If the [F]world had a [C]front porch [G7]like we did back [C]then
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Purple hulls and pintos I've [G7]shelled more than my [C]share 
[Am]Lightning bugs and [C]crickets danced in the evening [G7]air 
And like a [Am]beacon that ole' [Em]yellow moon it [F]always led me [C]home 
[Dm]Somehow momma [Em]always knew [F]just when to leave it [G7]on
