{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I stood upon the [C]sandy bank looking [D7]out across the [G]ocean
I [C]watched the ships come [G]safely in to [A7]rest beside the [D7]shore
The [G]friends of [D7]those a[G]board her were [C]gathered there to [G]meet them
It [C]made me long for [G]heaven where [D7]friends would part no [G]more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I'm sailing toward [G7]home toward the [C]old Ship of [G]Zion
I see the [C]lights up[G]on the banks [A7]across the misty [D7]foam
[G]Angels [D7]guard my [G]vessel 'til I'm [C]safe within the [G]harbor
[C]Captain guide my [G]ship '[D7]til I get [G]home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Momma sailed the [C]sea of life and [D7]knew the storms I'd [G]weather
She [C]told me about the [G]lighthouse that [A7]would chart my desti[D7]ny
The [G]misty veil has [G7]lifted now I [C]plainly see the [G]harbor
And [C]momma standing [G]on the bank to [D7]smile and welcome [G]me
