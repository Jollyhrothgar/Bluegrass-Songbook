{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]In my heart [F]the tears are falling in my dreams I'm always [C]calling
[G7]For your love but you keep stalling now there's [F]grieving in my [C]heart
[F]Oh I feel so forsaken and this lonely heart keeps [C]aching
[G7]And I guess I'll go on waiting  with this [F]grieving in my [C]heart
[F]Cause I know that I still love you  and I place no one above [C]you
[G7]And I'm always thinking of you  but there's [F]grieving in my [C]heart

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]Why did you even take me  then so suddenly forsake [C]me
[G7]Now you act just like you hate me  left [F]grieving in my [C]heart
[F]This heart can hardly make you  but I guess I'll have to take [C]you
[G7]Why did you leave and break it  put [F]grieving in my [C]heart
[F]Oh we could start all over  if you just come back [C]tomorrow
[G7]There'd be no pain and sorrow  and [F]grieving in my [C]heart
