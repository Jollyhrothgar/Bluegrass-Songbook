{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Tonight on a plane bound for [Em]Dallas [G]
I see the [C]bright lights of [D7]Tucson [G]below
Shining on [G7]all of the me[Em]mories[G] 
I [A7]thought I'd finally let [Am]go  [D7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
It's [G]been almost a [Em]year now[G] 
Since [C]I told her [D7]I could not [G]stay
And this [C]aching in my [D7]heart that [B7]I'm feeling [Em]now
Is the [C]price I guess [D7]I'll have to [G]pay[D7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
For leaving [G]Tuc[Em]son too [Bm]soon[G] 
At the [C]time it was some[Am]thing that I [Dm]just had to [C]do
But [G]tonight face to [F]face with that [C]old desert [G]moon 
It [A7]seems I left [D7]Tucson too [G]soon
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
From [Dm]thirty five thousand feet [C]up in the sky 
The [Am]truth becomes [G]clearer you [F]know
Cause it [Dm]wasn't till now that [C]I realized 
The [Am]fool that I [C]was long [D7]ago [C]   [D7]
