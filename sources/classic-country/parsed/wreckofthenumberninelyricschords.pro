{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]One dark stormy night not a star was in [C]sight
The [G]North wind came howling down the [D7]line
There stood a brave [G]engineer with his sweetheart so [C]dear
And his [G]orders to [D7]pull old Number [G]Nine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
She [D7]kissed him goodbye with a [G]tear in her [G7]eye
The [C]joy in his [G]heart he couldn't [D7]hide
The [G]whole world seemed right for she told him that [C]night
That [G]tomorrow she'd be [D7]his blushing [G]bride
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The wheels hummed a song as the train rolled [C]along
The [G]black smoke came pouring from the [D7]stack
The [G]headlight a gleam seemed to brighten his [C]dream
Of [G]tomorrow when [D7]he'd be going [G]back
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
He [D7]sped around the hill and his brave heart stood [G]still
The [C]headlight was [G]shining in his [D7]face
He [G]whispered a prayer as he threw on the [C]air
For [G]he knew this would be [D7]his final [G]race 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
In the wreck he was found lying there on the [C]ground
He [G]asked them to raise his weary [D7]head
His [G]breath slowly went as this message he [C]sent
To a [G]maiden who [D7]thought she would be [G]wed
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
There's a [D7]little white home that I built for our [G]own
Where [C]I dreamed we'd be [G]happy you and [D7]I
But I [G]leave it to you for I know you'll be [C]true
Till [G]we meet at the Golden [D7]Gate [G]goodbye
{end_of_verse}
