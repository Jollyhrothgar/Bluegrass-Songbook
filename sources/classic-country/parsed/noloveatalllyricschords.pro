{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Read in the paper nearly everyday 
People breaking up and just walking away
From [A#7]love and that's wrong 
Don't you [F]know that's wrong
A [C]happy little home comes up for sale 
Because two fools half tired and failed
To [A#7]get along and don't you [F]know that's wrong
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
A man hurts a woman and a woman hurts a man
And [Dm]neither one of them try to love and under[C]stand
And take it with a grain of [G7]salt
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
A [C]little bit of love is better than no love 
[F]Even sad love's better than no love
And [G7]even bad love is better than no love at [C]all
A little bit of love is better than no love 
[F]Even bad love's better than no love
And [G7]any kind of love is [F]better than [G7]no love at [C]all
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
No love at all is a poor old man 
Standin' on the corner with his hat in his hand
And there's [A#7]no place to go and he's [F]feeling low
[C]No love at all is a child in the street
Dodging traffic and a begging to eat
On the [A#7]tenement row and that's a [F]rough row to hoe
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
No love at all is a scared young girl 
[Dm]Standin' on the bridge on the edge of the wor[C]ld
And it's a pretty short [G7]fall
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
A [C]little bit of love is better than no love 
[F]Even sad love's better than no love
And [G7]even bad love is better than no love at [C]all
A little bit of love is better than no love 
[F]Even bad love's better than no love
And [G7]any kind of love is [F]better than [G7]no love at [C]all
