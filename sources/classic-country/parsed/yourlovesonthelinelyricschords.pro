{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]You've never cheated [C]you've never [G]lied
You've never had feelin's that [C]you've had to [G]hide
For [Am]she's got you thinkin' of somethin' so different [D7]tonight
It's [G]too late to worry what's [C]right or what's [G]wrong
And you're a little too crazy to [C]leave it [G]alone
When you're [Am]lookin' at somethin' that's too good to push it [D7]aside
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Boy [G]she's got your head in the [C]clouds
And your [G]heart in a bind [C]  [D7]
[G]How come you're feelin' so [C]proud
When your [D7]love's on the [G]line
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
You still think your first love's the [C]best in your [G]life
When you know you should hurry but you [C]can't say good[G]bye
And you [Am]know you can't go back 
And feel like you're where you [D7]belong
Now the [G]sweet taste of freedom is [C]hard to con[G]trol
When the touch of a woman's so [C]tender to [G]hold
She [Am]won't even let you remember how long you've been [D7]gone

When your [D7]love's on the [G]line
