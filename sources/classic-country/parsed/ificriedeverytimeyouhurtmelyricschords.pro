{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]If I'd cried   every time  [C7]you hurt [F]me 
I'd be [G7]cryin' all the [C]time
If I   made a scene   [C7]each time you were [F]mean 
we'd be [G7]quarrellin' all the [C]time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But [G7]I  don't cry and I don't get [C]mad 
I [G7]try  to take the good with the [C]bad
If I'd cried every time [C7]you hurt [F]me 
I'd be [G7]cryin' all the [C]time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now and then you say [C7]you love [F]me 
Oh I [G7]try to believe you [C]do
Then you turn right around [C7]and hurt [F]me 
Like I was [G7]nothing   to [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
But I love [G7]you so and I'll stay [C]somehow 
My [G7]tears won't flow and my head won't [C]bow
If I'd cry every [C7]time you hurt [F]me 
I'd be [G7]cryin' all the [C]time
{end_of_verse}
