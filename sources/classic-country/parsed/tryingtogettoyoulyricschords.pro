{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I've been traveling over mountains 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Even through the valleys too
I've been traveling night and [F]day  
I've been running all the [G7]way baby try to get to [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Ever since I read your letter
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Where you said you loved me true
I've been traveling night and [F]day  
I've been running all the [G7]way baby try to get to [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[C7]Well now there's nothing that could hold [F]me
Or to keep me way from you [C]ooooh    
Since your loving letter told [F]me 
Ah that you really love me true [G7]oooooh
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
I just had to reach you [C]baby 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Spite of all that I've been through
I kept traveling night and [F]day  
I kept running all the [G7]way baby try to get to [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
If I had to do it over
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 9}
That's exactly what I'd do
I would travel night and [F]day  
And I'd still run all the [G7]way baby try to get to [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 10}
[C7]Well since I read your loving [F]letter    
Well my heart began to [C]sing  
There are many miles between [F]us
Ah but they didn't mean a [G7]thing
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 11}
Lord's above he knows I love [C]you 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 12}
Well it was He who brought me through
When my way was black as [F]night 
He'd still shine bright as [G7]light 
When I was trying to get to [C]you
{end_of_verse}
