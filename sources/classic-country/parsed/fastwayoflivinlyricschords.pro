{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Every night you'll find me on a barstool somewhere
Drowning my sorrows and [D7]hiding my [G7]tears
Too [C]weak to face the future since my baby said goodbye
I know this fast way of living is just a [G7]slow way to [C]die
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Well I'm a honky tonk man in a honky tonk crowd
And you'll always find me where the [D7]music's playing [G7]loud
With [C]that laughing and dancing and the time just seems to fly
I know this fast way of living is just a [G7]slow way to [C]die
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The times running out for this honky tonk man
But I'll keep the pace just as [D7]long as I [G7]can
I'm [C]running from something that's already passed me by
I know this fast way of living is just a [G7]slow way to [C]die
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Well I'm a honky tonk man in a honky tonk world
And you can bet you'll find me with a [D7]honky tonk [G7]girl 
With [C]that laughing and dancing and the time just seems to fly
I know this fast way of living is just a [G7]slow way to [C]die
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Well I'm a honky tonk man in a honky tonk world

With [C]that laughing and dancing and the time just seems to fly
I know this fast way of living is just a [G7]slow way to [C]die
