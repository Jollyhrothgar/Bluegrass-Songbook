{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]You ask me if I'm happy now 
That's good as any joke I've [D7]heard
It seems that since I've seen you last 
I done forgot the meaning of the [G]words
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
If happiness is empty rooms and drinking in the afternoon
Well I suppose I'm happy as a [C]clown
But [D7]if it's got a thing to do with smiling or forgetting you
Well I don't guess that I can say I [G]am
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Did you ever see a down and outer waking up alone
Without a blanket on to keep him from the [D7]dew
When the water from the weeds has soaked the paper
He's been putting in his shoes to keep the ground from coming [G]through
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
And his future feels as empty as the pocket in his pants
Because he's never seen a single dream come [C]true
Well that's the [D7]way that I've been feeling 
Since the day I started falling
From the bottle to the bottom stool by stool
Learning how to live with losing [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
You wonder if I'm better off with freedom 
Now to do the things I [D7]choose
Well all my times my own and I got nothing left 
But sleeping time to [G]lose
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
There's no one here to carry on if I stay out the whole night long
Or give a tinkers damn if I don't [C]call
I'm [D7]living like I wanted to and doing things I wanna do
And nothing seems to mean a thing at [G]all
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Did you ever see a down and outer waking up alone
Without a blanket on to keep him from the [D7]dew
When the water from the weeds has soaked the paper
He's been putting in his shoes to keep the ground from coming [G]through
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
And his future feels as empty as the pocket in his pants
Because he's never seen a single dream come [C]true
Well that's the [D7]way that I've been feeling 
Since the day I started falling
From the bottle to the bottom stool by stool
Learning how to live with losing [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
[D7]From the bottle to the bottom losing [G]you
{end_of_verse}
