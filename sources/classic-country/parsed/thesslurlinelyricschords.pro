{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]The rattle of the chain as the anchor rolls 
Let's [F]skip a nod as the [C]whistle blows 
As [G7]me and my baby heard those engines [C]whine
She gave a shake and a mighty groan 
The [F]stern went down and the [C]bow did moan
As we [G7]set sail on the S.S. Lur[C]line
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
We picked up steam on the briny deep 
I gotta [F]deep fall wedding that I'm [C]gonna keep
I gotta [G7]see the captain and have him make you [C]mine 
Upon the bow in the silver spray
I [F]said I'd love honor and [C]obey 
We [G7]tied the knot on the S.S. Lur[C]line
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The porpoise played as we sailed along
The [F]trade winds seemed to [C]hum our song
As [G7]evening fell and the stars begin to [C]shine
I saw moonbeams in your hair
There [F]had never had been a [C]bride so fair
As I [G7]held you close on the S.S. Lur[C]line

I know I'll never forget that day
Those [F]two words that I [C]heard you say

Spring of love has reached December 
[F]Darling I'll always [C]remember 
Our [G7]honeymoon on the S.S. Lur[C]line
{end_of_verse}
