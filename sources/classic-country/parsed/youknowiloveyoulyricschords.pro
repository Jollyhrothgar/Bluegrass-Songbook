{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]When the morning sun  streaks across my [D7]room 
And I'm [C]waking up from another dream of [G]you 
Yes I'm on the road once again it [D7]seems
All I've [C]left behind is a chain of broken [G]dreams
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But you know I love [D7]you 
Yes I [C]love you oh [G]I love [D7]you
[G]How I wish that love was all we need to [D7]live 
What a [C]life we'd have cause I've got so much to [G]give 
And it seems so wrong deep inside my [D7]heart 
That the [C]dollar sign should be keeping us [G]apart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Chorus
But you know I love [D7]you 
Yes I [C]love you oh [G]I love [D7]you
And if [C]only I could find my way back to the [G]time 
When the [G7]problems of this life had not yet crossed our [C]minds
All the [F]answers could be found in children’s nursery [Bb]rhymes 
I'd come [C]running back to [F]you 
I'd come [D7]running back to [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
But you know we can't live on dreams [D7]alone 
And to [C]pay the rent I must leave you all [G]alone 
You know I made my choice many years [D7]ago 
Now this [C]traveling life is the only one I [G]know
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Repeat chorus
{end_of_verse}
