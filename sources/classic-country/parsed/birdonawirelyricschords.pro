[C]Like a bird  [G7]on a wire  [C]like a drunk in a midnight [F]choir 
I have [C]tried in my [G7]ways to be [C]free

I have [C]saved all my [G7]ribbons for [C]thee 
{end_of_verse}

And if [F]I if I have been un[C]kind

Like a [C]baby still[G7]born like a [C]beast with his [F]horn

[C]I'll make it [G7]all up to [C]thee

I saw a [F]young man leaning on his wooden [C]crutch

And a [F]young woman leaning in her darkened [C]door 
She cried [Dm]out to me why not ask for [G7]more 
{end_of_verse}
