{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]They say life goes [C]on  [D7]I’ll find true love [G]again
It’s not the [C]end of the [D7]world one day my heart will [G]mend 
Someone will come [C]along and a [D7]new love will [G]grow         
[Em]That’s what they [Am]say  [D7]but what do they [G]know
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
How could they know the [C]pain  I [D7]feel inside my [G]heart
They never lost your [C]love  [D7]so who do they think they [G]are
They never [C]held you  had [D7]to let you [G]go     
[Em]They’re not trying to live without [Am]you  so [D7]what do they [G]know
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
They say all is fair [C]in love but for me that’s just not [G]true        
I feel like [Em]someone took a knife [D7]and cut my life in [Am]two 
[D7]It’s better to have [C]love and lost than to [D7]have never loved I’m [G]told
[Em]At least that’s what they [Am]say  [D7]but what do they [G]know
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
They’re not trying to live [Am]without you  so [D7]what do they [G]know
{end_of_verse}
