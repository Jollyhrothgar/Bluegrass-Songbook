{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Darling many times I’ve had the chance to be un[G7]true
And many were the times I could have slipped around on [C]you
A chain of love binds me to you just [F]like an island band
[G7]Oh can’t you see I’ll always be a one woman [C]man
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Though a pretty face I see may sometime catch my [G7]eye
Though her smile may tempt me too I always pass her [C]by
There’s no one else but you for me [F]that’s part of nature’s plan
[G7]So trust in me I’ll always be a one woman [C]man
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Sometimes when we’re in a crowd I see you look at [G7]me
And in your eyes there is a sign of doubt and jealou[C]sy 
But have no fear I love you dear [F]that’s part of nature’s plan
[G7]So trust in me I’ll always be a one woman [C]man
{end_of_verse}
