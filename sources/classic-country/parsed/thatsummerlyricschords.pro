{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I went to work for her that summer 
A teenage kid so far from [Em]home
She was a lonely widow [C]woman 
Hell bent to make it on her [D7]own
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
We were a thousand miles from no[G]where 
Wheat fields as far as I could [Em]see
Both needing something from each [C]other 
[D7]Not knowing yet what that might [G]be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Till she came to me one evening 
Hot cup of coffee and a [Em]smile
In a dress that I was [C]certain 
She hadn't worn in quite a [D7]while
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
There was a difference in her [G]laughter 
There was a softness in her [Em]eyes
And on the air there was a [C]hunger 
[D7]Even a boy could recog[G]nize
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
She had a need to feel the [D7]thunder 
[C]To chase the lightning from the [G]skies
To watch the storm and all its [C]wonder 
Ragin' in her lover's [D7]eyes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
She had to ride the heat of [Em]passion 
[C]Like a comet burnin' [G]bright
Rushin' head long in the [C]wind 
But where only dreams had [D7]been
Burnin' both ends of the [G]night
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
That summer wind was all around me 
Nothin' between us but the [Em]night
And when I told her that I'd [C]never 
She softly whispered that's [D7]alright
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
And then I watched her hands of [G]leather
Turn to velvet in a [Em]touch
There's never been another [C]summer 
[D7]When I have ever learned so [G]much
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
She had a need to feel the [D7]thunder 
[C]To chase the lightning from the [G]skies
To watch the storm and all its [C]wonder

{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
She had to ride the heat of [Em]passion 
[C]Like a comet burnin' [G]bright
Rushin' head long in the [C]wind 
But where only dreams had [D7]been
Burnin' both ends of the [G]night
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 9}
I often think about that summer 
The sweat the moonlight and the [Em]lace
I have rarely held [C]another 
When I haven't seen her [D7]face
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 10}
Every time I pass a [G]wheat field 
Watch it dancin' with the [Em]wind
Although I know it isn't [C]real 
I just can't help but [D7]feel 
Her hungry arms [G]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}

Burnin' both ends of the [G]night
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 11}
Rushin' head long in the [C]wind 
Out where only dreams had [D7]been
Burnin' both ends of the [G]night
