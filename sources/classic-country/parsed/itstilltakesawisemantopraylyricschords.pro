{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Lord the first time you came here there was [C]no one to receive You 
Just a [G]stable for a [A7]place to lay Your [D7]head 
On a [G]dark winter’s evening with a [C]star to mark Your presence 
There came [G]wise men to worship they were [D7]kneeling by Your [G]bed

And it [C]still takes a wise man to [G]bow be[D7]fore the [G]King
To [D7]worship and adore You more than [G]any other thing
We [C]offer up a [Am]sacrifice of [G]praise for You each day
And it [C]still takes a [D7]wise man to [G]pray

With great anticipation Lord we [C]wait for Your returning
For the [G]bridegroom to come and [A7]take his bride [D7]away

For the [G]harvest to be [D7]gathered on that [G]day
