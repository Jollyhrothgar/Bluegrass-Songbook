Well my heart feels like burstin' when you walk into the room

In [F]search of true affection I found a new direction 
And [C]that's straight to you
Oh I [F]use to like to play around

Oh my [C]friends sure like to gossip 
Think they know the gospel truth
Words leak like a faucet when it comes to me and you
