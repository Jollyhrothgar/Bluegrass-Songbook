There's A Limit
Recorded Stonewall Jackson
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G]In my troubled sleep my [C]hands reach out to [G]touch you
But you're no longer there to [D7]greet my hungry [G]hands
Then I wake up and I [G7]cry out in the [C]darkness
And I wonder [G]how much more [D7]of this my heart can [G]stand
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
A man can [D7]stand so much hurting
I've [G]stood a lot that's for certain
But [C]without your love I'm [G]bound to lose my [D7]mind
I've cried so [G]much I hurt all over
And breaking [C]forty's getting closer
There's a [G]limit and I've [D7]almost reached [G]mine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Once I had my pride and [C]called myself a [G]strong man
But my strength and pride walked [D7]out the door with [G]you
Now this awful aching [G7]hurt keeps tearing [C]at me
It's killing [G]me to think of [D7]you with someone [G]new
