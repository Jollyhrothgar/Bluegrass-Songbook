[C]He came rollin' into Cowtown in a big old double trailer diesel [G7]rig
And [D7]just as luck would [G7]have it
Well the [D7]driver let him [G7]out in front 
Of this old beer joint where I [C]picked
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
He had a worn out fiddle case he carried like a child
Tucked beneath his arm as he walked [F]in
He strolled up to the bandstand and [C]laid a dollar down
And [G7]wondered if we'd mind if he sat [C]in
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
While he tuned up with the guitar 
Well the boys all turned around and looked at [G7]me
The way that he was dressed and looked everybody thought
That he was some old bum who walked in off the [C]street
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Then when he drew that bow across the strings and made 'em cry
We knew he wasn't no ordinary [F]man 
And when he hit a breakdown by [C]himself to warm it up
We [G7]knew we had a fiddler in our [C]band
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
He played a [F]good old country breakdown 
Like you've never heard a breakdown played [C]before [G7]    [C]
He [F]made you feel like you're a part of Faded Love and Cheatin' Heart 
And [D7]topped it off with Rose of San [G7]Antone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
He [F]played a verse of Uncle Pen the crowd would roar he'd play again
They bought him beer 'til he couldn't drink no [C]more
We [G7]thought he'd wear his fingers off
Cause the only time he'd ever stop was long enough rosin up the [C]bow
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
He played a [F]good old country breakdown 
Like you've never heard a breakdown played [C]before [G7]    [C]

And [D7]topped it off with Rose of San [G7]Antone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
He [F]played a verse of Uncle Pen the crowd would roar he'd play again
They bought him beer 'til he couldn't drink no [C]more
And be[G7]fore we knew what he had done he'd buttoned that old fiddle up
And caught himself a ride on down the [C]road
{end_of_verse}
