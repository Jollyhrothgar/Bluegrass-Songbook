[C]I can hear a [G7]heartbeat it [F]seems a little [C]strong
I can hear the [G7]things that I did [F]wrong
[C]I can hear her [G7]thoughts by [F]looking in her [C]eyes
I can hear [G7]all the times she [F]cried[C]

I can hear the [G7]memories as they [F]echo off the [C]wall

I can hear [G7]all the things I [F]could not [C]see

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Those are the sounds [G7]of a woman [F]leavin'
[C]Stronger than a [G7]wind in the willow [F]tree
Those are the [C]sounds [G7]of a heart [F]breakin'
You can't hear it [G7]but the noise is killin' [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I should have heard it [G7]comin' but I [F]chose to [C]pretend
I should have [G7]recognized that sound [F]way back then

Now the truth is [G7]ringin' clear in my [C]ears
