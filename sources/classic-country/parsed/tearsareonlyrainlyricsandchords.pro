Now when your lover smiles let [C]her set your heart a [G]glow
But don't forsake her [D7]when she's feeling [G]low
Hold her to your heart dry her [C]eyes and let her [G]know
That tears are only [D7]rain to make love [G]grow
She may [C]smile because she [G]knows your love [D7]is deep and [G]true
But [C]when she sheds a [G]tear she may get [A7]blue because of [D7]you
[G]So when your lover cries tell [C]her that you love her [G]so
For tears are only [D7]rain to make love [G]grow
For tears are only [D7]rain to make love [G]grow
