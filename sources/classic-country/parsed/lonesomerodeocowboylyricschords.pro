[C]I own this horse and saddle and [F]that old Cadi[C]llac
This broken down horse trailer and the [D7]clothes that are on my [G7]back 
I [F]know that it ain't a [C]hell of a lot but it's all that I can [G7]show
For [F]seventeen years [C]makin' my livin' [G7]ridin' the rode[C]os

My wife left me five years ago in [F]one of them rodeo [C]towns
I [F]can't say that I [C]blame her much she just [D7]wanted to settle [G7]down
Oh [F]God how I miss that [C]woman and it hurts so to see her [G7]go
If [F]I was smart I woulda [C]stuck by her but I'm [G7]hooked on this rod[C]eo
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now I'm just a [F]lonesome [C]cowboy I'm a little bit over the [G7]hill
I shoulda [F]quit this thing a long [C]time ago but I [D7]guess I never [G7]will
So I [C]keep on movin' from shore to shore [F]hopin' to change my [C]luck
My [F]good old days are all a [C]memory but I [G7]just can't give it [C]up

There was a time I used to do alright and [F]bring home my share a [C]dough
But now I'm losin' out to the younger boys I guess [D7]I must be gettin' [G7]slow
If [F]there's one thing you [C]learn this you gotta make it on your [G7]own
Cause [F]when you're on top you got a [C]million friends
But when you're [G7]down buddy you're all [C]alone
