[C]There's a jukebox [G7]in my [C]ear playing so loud I can [F]hardly [C]hear
And it's a telling a [G7]story bout a girl like [C]you
And each selection [G7]that I [C]make tells me how my [F]heart will [C]break
For falling in [G7]love with a girl like [C]you

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Well it's [G7]just an old machine without a [F]heart but oh so [C]mean
Says I probably spend my whole life feeling [G7]blue
I'll [C]just put in [G7]one more [C]dime and play that same song [F]one more [C]time
Cause I want to [G7]hear about a girl like [C]you

Cause I'll always [G7]dream about a girl like [C]you
