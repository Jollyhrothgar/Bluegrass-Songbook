{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]She sits alone at a [D7]table  stares into a glass of [G]wine
Plays the same song on the [D7]jukebox 
That’s she’s played so many [G]times
Dark bars and sad [C]music  [D7]seems to ease her troubled [G]mind
But that’s what plays the [D7]jukebox  that’s what sells the [G]wine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
When somebody finds a new [C]love  [D7]it always breaks another’s [G]heart
When somebody builds a [C]new love  [A7]another’s world falls [D7]apart
[G]Someone’s always [C]leaving  [D7]somebody else is left [G]behind
But that’s what plays the [D7]jukebox  that’s what sells the [G]wine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Time will heal the [D7]heartache  another love will come [G]along
Tonight she’ll feel the [D7]heartbreak  and cry burning tears [G]alone
She don’t want con[C]versation  [D7]perhaps another [G]time
Tonight she lives with [D7]memories  the music and the [G]wine
