{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]All the [G7]days of my youth I [C]remember so well
I [G7]lived in a world all my [C]own
[F]Nobody cared where my [C]money came from
When [G7]I had it I wasn't [C]alone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh the [G7]wine flowed freely and [C]friendship was mine
[G7]How they all loved me back [C]then
But [F]here in this prison I [C]sit all alone
And [G7]now where are all of my [C]friends
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
So [G7]drink and be merry if [C]this is your wish
Or [G7]waste your young life out in [C]sin
But [F]remember someday you may [C]be as I am
With [G7]nothing not even a [C]friend
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh the [G7]wine flowed freely and [C]friendship was mine
[G7]How they all loved me back [C]then
But [F]here in this prison I [C]sit all alone
And [G7]now where are all of my [C]friends
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
So [G7]here's to the freedom I never [C]shall have
I [G7]know it's not long till the [C]end
But [F]I'd rather be dead than to [C]spend ninety years
With the [G7]cold prison walls for a [C]friend
{end_of_verse}
