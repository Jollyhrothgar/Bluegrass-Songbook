{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[F]Well I [C]heard those city [F]singers singing [C]bout how they can [F]love
[C]Deeper than the [F]oceans higher [C]than the stars [F]above
Well I [C]come from the [F]country and I [C]know I ain't seen it [F]all
But I [C]heard that ocean's [F]salty and the [C]stars they [F]sometimes [C]fall
And that [Dm]would not justice to the [Em]way I feel for you
So I [F]had to sing a [C]song about [Dm]all the things I [G7]knew
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
My love is [C]deeper than the [F]holler [C]stronger than the [F]river
[Am]Higher than the [Dm]pine trees growing [F]tall upon the [Dm]hill
[G7]My love is [C]purer than the [F]snowflakes that [C]fall in late [Am]December
And [Dm]honest as a [C]robin on a [F]springtime window sill
And [Dm]longer than the [G7]song of a whippoor[C]will
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]From the [C]backroads to the [F]Broadway shows with a [C]million miles [F]between
There's at [C]least a million [F]love songs that [C]people [F]love to [C]sing
And [Dm]everyone is different and [Em]everyone's the same
And [F]this is just [C]another way of [Dm]saying the same [G7]thing
