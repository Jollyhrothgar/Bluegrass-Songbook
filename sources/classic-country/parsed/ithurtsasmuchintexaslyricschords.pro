{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Hey we broke up in Nashville on a cold and rainy [D7]night
[G]My tears mixed with the cold rain drops as she walked out of sight
[C]So I put Nashville in my rear view mirror and headed south
[D7]Cause I thought the girls in San Antone would knock her memory [G]out
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]But it hurts as much in Texas as it did in Tennessee
[D7]Lone star lonely down and blue is what they're callin' [G]me
[C]I thought these Texas dance halls nights would kill my misery
[D7]But it hurts as much in Texas as it did in [G]Tennessee
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[D7]My heart still lives in Nashville with the girl I long to see
[G]I'm tryin' to forget the way that she broke up with me
[C]I thought that I could two step her sweet memory from my mind
[D7]But she still waltzes through my dreams and wakes me up at [G]night
