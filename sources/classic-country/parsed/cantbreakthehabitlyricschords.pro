[G]I can kick any habit  that [C]is if I want [G]to
Or I can lay off  [D7]whatever I’m [G]on
But of all the things  that [C]I’ve been a slave [G]to
Hey you’re the one thing  I [D7]can’t leave [G]alone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I can’t break the [C]habit  love is too [G]strong
I can’t take the [D7]cure now  I’ve been hooked to [G]long
I crave your [C]loving  wouldn’t quit if I [G]could
Can’t break the [D7]habit  cause I have it to [G]good
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I can stay off the bottle  go [C]straight if I want [G]to
Or I can stay high  [D7]till the curtain comes [G]down
I used to get around love  and [C]move on if I had [G]to
But you’re the one thing  I [D7]can’t get [G]around
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
