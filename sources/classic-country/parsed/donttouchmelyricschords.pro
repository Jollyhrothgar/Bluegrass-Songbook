{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Your hand is like a torch each time you touch [D7]me
That [F]look in your [G7]eyes pulls me [C]apart
Don't open the door to heaven if I can't come [D7]in
Don't [F]touch me if you don't love [G7]me [C]sweetheart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Your kiss is like a drink when I'm [D7]thirsty 
And I'm [F]thirsty for you [G7]with all my [C]heart
But please don't love me then act as though we've never [D7]kissed
Don't [F]touch me if you don't love [G7]me [C]sweetheart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]Don't give me something that you might take [C]away
[F]To have you then lose you wouldn't be [D7]smart on my [G7]part
Don't [C]open the door to heaven if I can't come [D7]in
Don't [F]touch me if you don't love [G7]me [C]sweetheart
No don't [F]touch me if you don't love [G7]me [C]sweetheart
{end_of_verse}
