{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]The only thing I really own is what you see me wearin' on my [G7]back
The only friends I've ever known are the kind you meet along a railroad [C]track
The kind you bum tobacco from and view the world with through a boxcar [G7]door
A [F]friend who talks and [G7]makes you laugh has [F]nothin' much but [G7]gives you half
And [F]maybe you don't [G7]see him any[C]more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Special I hear your lonesome whistle [F]whine   it's callin' me
[G7]Special keep movin' me on down the [C]line
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
My mackinaw is full of holes ain't too good at keepin' out the [G7]cold
My shoes are worn so paper thin 
My feet can feel the cinders through the [C]soles
Sometimes I see a pretty girl wonder what I've missed along the [G7]way
Once [F]someone special [G7]wore my ring and [F]loved me more than [G7]anything
I [F]gave her up and [G7]caught a train one [C]day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Special I had a special girl one [F]time   now she's not mine
[G7]Special keep movin' me on down the [C]line
{end_of_verse}
