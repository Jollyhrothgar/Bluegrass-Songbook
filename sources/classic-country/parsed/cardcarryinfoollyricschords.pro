[C]It takes all kinds to keep this world in place
It's a fragile [G7]balance that [C]lets us spin through space
So [D7]everybody's got their job to do
And girl I guess the job I've got is [G7]cryin' over you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And [A7]I should get a gold watch for [D7]all the years I gave
And I [G7]should get some interest now for [C]all the dues I've paid
I [A7]don't know why I love you [D7]it's just the job I do
I'm your [G7]registered certified card carryin' [C]fool
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
If I was in the army there'd be medals that I'd get
If I was in the circus at least I'd have a net
If [D7]I was an electrician I might could find a spark
And if I could be a [G7]surgeon girl I might could find your heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
But I keep [A7]bending over backwards just to be your [D7]limbo man
While you [G7]drop that stick another notch [C]every chance you can
[A7]I don't know why I love you [D7]it's just the job I do
I'm your [G7]registered certified card carryin' [C]fool
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Oh [A7]if I was a gambler I might [D7]have better luck
If I [G7]was a mathematician I could [C]make it all add up
But [A7]when it comes down to it [D7]all I wanna do
Is be your [G7]registered certified card carryin' [C]fool
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Yeah [A7]when it comes down to it [D7]all I wanna do
Is be your [G7]registered certified card carryin' [C]fool
{end_of_verse}
