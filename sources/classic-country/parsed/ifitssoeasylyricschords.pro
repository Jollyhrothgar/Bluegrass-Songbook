[D7]They say that [G]love’s [C]just a piece of [D7]cake
They tell me [G]love is [C]just a give and [D7]take
And make love [C]sound like [D7]it comes easi[G]ly   
[C]If it’s so [G]easy [D7]why was it [C]so [D7]hard for [G]me [C]  [D7]

Say that [G]love will [C]sparkle in her [D7]eyes
Tell me [G]love’s not [C]hard to recogn[D7]ize 
Make love [C]sound like [D7]it’s not hard to [G]find
[C]If it’s that [G]easy [D7]what was [C]it made [D7]me so [G]blind

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[Em]If love is [Bm]good  [C]and love is [G]great[Bm] 
[Em]Why don’t they make love too [C]good to [D7]break
My friends tell [G]me that [C]I will love [D7]again
But I’m much [G]wiser [C]now than I was [D7]then

I’ve seen how [C]easy [D7]love can change its [G]mind (change its [C]mind)
It does so [G]easy [D7]that’s why [C]I’m so [D7]scared this [G]time[D7]
[Em]If love is [Bm]good  [C]and love is [G]great 
[Em]Then why don’t they make love too [C]good to [D7]break
{end_of_verse}
