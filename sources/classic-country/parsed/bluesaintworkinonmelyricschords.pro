{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]There's a new [F]expression on my [C]face I ain't [F]seen in quite a [C]while
Must be a smile [F]
[C]There's a new [F]direction in my [C]life and [F]I can't wait to [C]see
Where it takes [F]me[Am]
I'm no longer [F]lost in the past
[C]Even my troubles just [F]roll off my [G7]back
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
No the [C]blues ain't [F]workin' on [G7]me those [F]old [C]memories
[F]Can't put the [G7]hurt in my heart
[C]And love is [F]lettin' me [C]know I'm [Am]finally [F]free
And [G7]cause of you I'll [F]always be
[G7]No the blues ain't workin' on [C]me [F]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]Anytime the [F]sun would start to [C]shine some dark [F]cloud would come [C]around
And start raining down [F]
[C]Since I found the [F]shelter of your [C]arms I don't [F]feel the rain no [C]more 
So let it [F]pour[Am]
Might be times [F]when we lose our way
[C]But I know tomorrow I'm [F]still gonna [G7]say
{end_of_verse}

[C]And love is [F]lettin' me [C]know I'm [Am]finally [F]free
And [G7]cause of you I'll [F]always be
[G7]No the blues ain't workin' on [C]me [F]
