{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Stars on the water across the bay
A [C]perfect mood for love to be made
[G]Where will go a bottle of rum
[C]Two hearts beatin' to a distant drum
We [Bm]cast our cares out on a tropical [A#7]breeze
And [Am]she lay down [D7]next to me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And we [C]sailed away into the [Am]night
On a [G]blanket of love under enchanted skies
I [C]swear it felt like heaven right from the [D7]stars
With that [C]old silver moon to light our [Am]way
In a [G]blue lagoon we found a hideaway
And [Am]somewhere deep in the [D7]night 
I lost my [C]heart on paradise [G]isle
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
She looks so good with that golden tan
[C]Barefoot runnin' through the cool white sand
She [G]washed away the blue in my eyes
And [C]all my worries went out with the tide
I [Bm]thought to myself can this be [A#7]real
I [Am]can't describe how she [D7]made me feel
