[G]The wind was [D7]blowing through your [Am]hair

[G]You looked like a [D7]picture sittin' [Am]there

The [Am]water was singing our [C]hearts were beatin' [D7]fast
Two [Am]high school lovers thinkin' [C]it would always [D7]last

Down by the [C]river[G]side on a [D7]warm summer [G]night
We [C]gave into [Em]passion for the [D7]very first time

And we found [C]heaven  [D7]down by the [G]riverside

Now you're [D7]nothing but a [Am]ghost

[Am]There's no happy ending but I [C]know our love will [D7]last
[Am]Cause when I close my eyes you [C]always [D7]take me back
