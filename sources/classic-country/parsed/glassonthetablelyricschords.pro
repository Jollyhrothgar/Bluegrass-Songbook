{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]In a tavern on the corner you'll [G7]find me every night
Tryin' to forget our love that [F]didn't turn out [C]right
My eyes just stare at nothing here I [G7]sit a broken man
With a [F]glass on the [G7]table and your picture in my [C]hand
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
A glass on the table your picture in my [G7]hand
Why I had to lose you I [F]just don't under[C]stand
I said that I'd forget but it won't happen like I [G7]plan
With a [F]glass on the [G7]table and your picture in my [C]hand
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
There's a jukebox loudly playing but I [G7]never hear the song
Cause I'm staring at your picture and [F]wondering what went [C]wrong
Everybody dancin' by me must [G7]wonder bout the man
With a [F]glass on the [G7]table and a picture in his [C]hand
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
A glass on the table your picture in my [G7]hand
Why I had to lose you I [F]just don't under[C]stand
I said that I'd forget but it won't happen like I [G7]plan
With a [F]glass on the [G7]table and your picture in my [C]hand
{end_of_verse}
