{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G7]Mona [C]Lisa Mona Lisa men have [F]named [C]you 
You're so like the lady with a mystic [Dm]smile
[G7]Is it [Dm]only cause you're lonely they have blamed [G7]you
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your [C]smile
Do you smile to tempt the lover Mona [C][F]Li-sa 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Or is this your way to hide a broken [F]heart
Many [Fm]dreams have been brought to your [C]doorstep
They just lie [G7]that and they'd die [C]there
[C7]Are you [F]warm are you real Mona [C]Lisa 
Or just a [G7]cold and lonely lovely work of [C]art
Or just a cold and lonely lovely work of art
{end_of_verse}
