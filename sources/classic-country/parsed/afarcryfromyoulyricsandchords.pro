{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I'm on a white line runnin' down the interstate
Tryin' to [Am]wipe away the rain that's runnin' down my face
Goin' [Dm]any old ware any old place just [F]someplace else[G7]
By [Am]now you know that [G7]I'm not there and if you [F]don't know why
Well [Am]can't you see the [C]tears it took for [Dm]me to say good[F]bye[G7]

Yeah [C]I left a few on your old sweater
[F]I watched them fall on [C]love sick letters
And [Dm]I cried a river [C]cried a mile wide one
[F]I'd even cried [G7]some crocodile ones
But [C]from out here you can't hear me callin'
[F]And you won't see me when [C]I start fallin'
Cause this [Dm]time baby the [C]next time that I [F]do
I'll be a [G7]far cry from [C]you

In a moment of truth it's a matter of fact
There's only [Am]one way to go and that ain't goin' back
So [Dm]I ain't stopped since I stopped for gas a [F]hundred miles ago[G7]
And right [Am]now I'm caught some[G7]where between gone and [F]gone for good
And these [Am]tears will dry but [C]there have been 
Times I [Dm]wondered if they [F]would[G7]
