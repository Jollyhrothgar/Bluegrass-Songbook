{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I'm not the [Em]hero who will [Gm]always save the [C]day[C7]
Don't [F]always wear the [C]white hat don't [Dm]always know the [E7]way
I [Am]may not even be the dream you wanted to come [Fm]true
But I'll [Dm]always [C]be the [F]man in [D7]love with [G7]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]I'm not the [Em]key that [Gm]opens every [C]door[C7]
[F]I don't have the [C]power to give you [Dm]all you want and [E7]more
But [Am]when you're needin' something special you can hold on [Fm]to
I'll [Dm]always [C]be the [F]man in [D7]love [G7]with [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[Am]I never could work [D7]miracles there may be [G7]others who can [C]do what I can't [F]do
But no one [Dm]else can be as [C]good as me [Am]at lovin' [F]you [G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]So when the world [Em]won't turn the [Gm]way you wish it [C]would [C7]
And the [F]dreams you have don't [C]come alive as [Dm]often as they [E7]should
[Am]Remember that there's someone there whose heart is always [Fm]true
I'll [Dm]always [C]be the [F]man in [D7]love [G7]with [C]you
(Gets harder with key change)
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[Bbm]Remember that there's someone there whose [Gm]heart is always [Gbm]true
[Ebm]Someone [Db]there to [Eb]help you [F]make it [Bbm]through [Eb7]
I'll [Ebm]always [Db]be the [A]man in [Ab7]love with [Db]you
