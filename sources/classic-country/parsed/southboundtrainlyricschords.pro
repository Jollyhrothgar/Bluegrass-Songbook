{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Well she was born in a north woods town 
Twenty-one winters [D7]ago
And she grew tired of the freezing cold 
And living in the blinding [G]snow
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
This girl knew she wouldn't be there long 
Cause she had plans and [D7]dreams
And she'd seen pictures of the sunshine state 
In the pages of the maga[G]zine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
So she waited them tables and she used her smile 
Saving every penny she [D7]can
For a one-way Dixie bound Amtrak ticket 
Headed for the promised [G]land
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Her momma and daddy begged her not to go 
When the day she dreamed of [D7]came
And she waved goodbye sittin' way up high 
From the window of a southbound [G]train
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Now she's got a fire burnin' deep inside 
Ridin' on a southbound [D7]train
And the clickety-clack of that railroad track 
Only helps to fan the [G]flames
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
No more worries no more cares 
She left them up in Bangor [C]Maine
Now [D7]she's startin' a brand new life 
Ridin' on a southbound [G]train
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
She said hello sun good mornin' Daytona 
You're sure looking good to [D7]me
With your ocean breeze and your tall palm trees 
And your southern hospitali[G]ty
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
Now she's a knockout queenie in a string bikini 
She's drivin' all the boys [D7]insane
And this all started with a small town dream 
And a ticket on a southbound [G]train
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 9}
Cause she had a fire burnin' deep inside 
Ridin' on a southbound [D7]train
And the clickety-clack of that railroad track 
Only helps to fan the [G]flames
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 10}
No more worries no more cares 
She left them up in Bangor [C]Maine
Yeah she [D7]likes the boys with the southern drawl 
Soakin' up the sunshine havin' a ball
She'll be the first to tell you that she owes it all 
To ridin' on a southbound [G]train
{end_of_verse}
