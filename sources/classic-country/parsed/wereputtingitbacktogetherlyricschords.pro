[C]Our world was falling apart 
We were [C7]breaking each other's [F]heart
Doing [G7]things we knew were gonna [C]hurt 
We watched a good thing go bad 
De[C7]stroyed the love we [F]had 
And I [G7]almost forgot the way love was at [C]first

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
We're puttin' it back together 
It's [F]gonna be even better 
Than the [C]love we had in the [G7]past 
We're [C]gonna start with solid love 
Real [F]things we're sure of 
And a [G7]little old fashioned feeling to make it [C]last

I'm sorry if I cheated
I know [C7]you've been mis[F]treated

I al[C7]most wrecked our happy [F]home 
But it's [G7]gonna be different this [C]time
