{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]We're man and wife on paper 
But the [F]things just ain't the [C]same here
Lovers now are strangers how we've [G7]changed
It's the [C]end of our forever 
And we [F]just can't stay to[C]gether
And I think it's [F]time to [G7]break these paper [C]chains
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Paper [F]chains can't hold us to[C]gether
[F]All we have in [C]common is our [G7]name
Paper [F]chains can't hold us for[C]ever[F]
And I [C]think it's [F]time to [G7]break these paper [C]chains
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
There's nothing left between us  
Now that [F]love has gone to [C]pieces
Love that's lost is seldom found [G7]again
[C]Why should we keep tryin' 
While our [F]hearts are slowly [C]dyin'
Don't you think it's [F]time to [G7]break these paper [C]chains
{end_of_verse}
