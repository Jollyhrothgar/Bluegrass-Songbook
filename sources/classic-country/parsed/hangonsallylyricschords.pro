{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]In the mountains there's a valley of love named Sally
A [D7]full moon shinin' down on [G]moonshine valley
She's a'waitin' and a'hopin' that I'll come a'callin'
Callin' [D7]to her through the water where the waterfall is [G]fallin'.

She loves me and she needs me and her love is a'wastin'

Up the [D7]mountain to my fountain of [G]love

[G]Through the brush and the rubble I'm a'[C]callin' on the [G]double

So [D7]take me to my valley of [G]love
