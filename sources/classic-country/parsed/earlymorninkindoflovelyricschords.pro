[G]I wake to see the darkness dying
Gentle touch where she’s lying

Last parts of her dreams flying
[C]As I kiss the night time from her [D7]eyes

I love that early [D7]morning kind of [G]love

Lord knows when I hold her 
Lying soft against my shoulder

The soft touch of her finger tips
[C]I love that early morning kind of [D7]love

Tangled sheets and thrown off covers
Left behind by morning lovers
[C]Now gone on to face another [D7]day

We’ll pray the Lord our soul to keep
[C]So we can wake up in that special [D7]way
