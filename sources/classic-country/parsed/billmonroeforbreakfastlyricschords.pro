[G]When I was just a little boy we [C]lived down on a [G]farm
Seven miles from nowhere and a hundred miles from [D7]harm
We [G]made our livin' from the dirt [C]if anything would [G]grow
And we got our country music from a [D7]big old radi[G]o

We had a big old battery that [C]ran the radi[G]o

So we had Bill Monroe for [D7]breakfast [G]anyway

Momma was a lady and my [C]daddy liked to [G]preach
All we ever had was just a place to eat and [D7]sleep

Oh we'd have Bill Monroe for breakfast [D7]every [G]day
