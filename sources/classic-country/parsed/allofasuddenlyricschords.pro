{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]For a while I was happy for a while I had you
The thought never once crossed my [C7]mind
That you'd [F]walked away with the only world I [C]knew
And [G7]leave just a memory [C]behind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C7]But all of a sudden it's a lonely [F]world 
[D7]All of a sudden I'm [G7]alone
[C7]All of a sudden I miss you [F]girl 
[G7]Cause all of a sudden you're [C]gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I don't know what happened to drive you away
And leave all these heartaches [C7]behind
I [F]just hope you're happy and I pray that your [C]world
[G7]Is never as empty as [C]mine
{end_of_verse}

[G7]Cause all of a sudden you're [C]gone
