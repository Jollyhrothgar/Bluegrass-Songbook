But my heart [C]is chilled and my eyes are [G]filled
As [A7]I watch the leaves of red and brown fall sadly to the [D7]ground
You must [C]keep your promise Willie [G]Thomas
There'll [D7]be on spring until you bring your love again to [G]me

Let your [C]heart not be chilled nor your eyes be [G]filled
Cause [A7]I love you though you say the leaves are falling slowly [D7]down

And [D7]there'll be spring cause with the birds I'll sing my love again to [G]you
[C]Keep your promise Willie [G]Thomas
