[C]Down in old Mexico  
[F]Where I was running from [C]life
I brought the love of a [G7]lady 
And went to pay for the [C]night
She laughed and said keep your money
[F]It just wouldn't be [C]right 
I must have looked un[G7]believing
Then she said with a [C]smile

I love to do what I love to

[D7]Running easy and [G7]smooth
I love to do what I [C]love to 
[F]I like to live with the [C]truth
I love to do [F]what I love to do 
[G7]And I love loving [C]you

Before I knew I ask her 
[F]To come away in the [C]night
And on a farm in west [G7]Texas 
We can make a new [C]life
After all of them hard times 
[F]She stood by my [C]side
And here's what she [G7]told me 
Each time I ask [C]why

[G7]Life was easy to[C]gether 
[F]As the years slipped [C]away

I can still see her [G7]smiling face 
I can still hear her [C]say
