{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]The handle on my [F]suitcase is [C]comin' off [Am]again
And the [F]cleaners only sent back half my [G7]things
The [C]forecast of the [F]weather says we're [C]in for heavy rain
And you [Dm]know I don't like [D7]driving in the [G7]rain
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [F]wish the sun was shinin' I'd be [C]on the road right now
With nothing but a good time on my [Dm]mind [G7]
I [F]hope that you don't think 
That you're the [C]reason I'm still [Am]here
Or [F]think that love is [G7]puttin' off good[C]bye
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
This just ain't no [F]good day for [G7]leavin'
[F]Against my wants and [G7]wishes I [F]guess I'll have to [C]stay
This just ain't no [F]good day for [G7]leavin'
If [F]it's alright with [G7]you I think I'll [C]wait
(Think I'll [F]wait think I'll [G7]wait think I'll wait)
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]Today my eyes are [F]misty and I'm [C]all choked up [Am]inside
It's [F]funny how cold can make you [G7]cry
[C]Jimmy called and [F]said he found my [C]lighter in his [Am]car
Can I [Dm]help it if he can't come by till [G7]five
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[F]Just because I don't let on how [C]much my heart has changed
Don't think that I can't walk right out that [Dm]door[G7]
If [F]I still cared for you I'd find a [C]way to stall for time
It's a [F]good thing I don't [G7]love you any[C]more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
This just ain't no [F]good day for [G7]leavin'
[F]Against my wants and [G7]wishes I [F]guess I'll have to [C]stay
This just ain't no [F]good day for [G7]leavin'
If [F]it's alright with [G7]you I think I'll [C]wait
(Think I'll [F]wait think I'll [G7]wait)
Just think I'll [C]wait
