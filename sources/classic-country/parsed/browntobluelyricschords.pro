Brown To Blue
by George Jones
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G]We stood there in the courthouse room so [C]close yet far apart
[D7]You had brought your lawyer and I'd [G]brought a broken heart
The judge pronounced the words the way you [C]wanted him to do
And [D7]changed your name from Brown to Jones
And mine from Brown to [G]Blue   
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I [C]couldn't keep my tears from falling
[G]On the courtroom floor  
By [C]law they took away my rights
To [G]love you any[D7]more
My [G]world just seemed to stop
While I stood [C]there so close to you
They [D7]changed your name from Brown to Jones
And mine from Brown to [G]Blue
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
The judge forgot to tell me how I'd [C]live my life alone
What [D7]I would do without you after [G]loving you so long
He didn't seem to care that I am [C]still in love with you
He [D7]changed your name from Brown to Jones
And mine from Brown to [G]Blue
