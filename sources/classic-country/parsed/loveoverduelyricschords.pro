{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]It seems I'm always settin' myself [C]up for a [G]fall
Sometimes I wish that I could end it once and for [D7]all
I keep [G]payin' but I never [C]get the love from [G]you
Yes I keep payin' [D7]for love over[G]due
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]Love overdue how I [G]wish it wasn't true
That it always cost you more than I get from [D7]you
You keep [G]saying you love me but the [C]feelings don't come [G]true
And I keep payin' [D7]for love over[G]due
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Maybe if I lost you I would [C]finally [G]win
At least I'd have the chance to be my old self [D7]again
I [G]should collect what's left in me and [C]start life without [G]you
Instead of payin' [D7]for love over[G]due
{end_of_verse}
