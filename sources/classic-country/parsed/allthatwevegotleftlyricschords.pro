{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I once held that someone special [F]didn't have to let her [C]go
I just stood back and watched my future [G7]pass
And for the [C]awful shape I'm in [F]I can only blame [Am]myself
It's no [C]wonder that her love for me [G7]wasn't strong enough to [C]last
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Holding [F]on for all its worth to all that we got [C]left
And for what it's worth we've been less than easy on [G7]ourselves
If [C]we could write a book they [F]couldn't keep it on the [Am]shelf
We're [C]just trying to get it right with [G7]all that we've got [C]left
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I was there when the bar room opened [F]I've been there at closing [C]time
There were things I couldn't handle by [G7]myself
Then the [C]right one picked me up and [F]we left it all [Am]behind
She [C]said I'm all she'll ever need and [G7]for me there's no one [C]else
