[C]While my love held me tight 
I was dancing one night
To the waltz of the Ala[G7]mo 
I heard bells softly chime
As she vowed to be mine 
To the waltz of the Ala[C]mo

Came the dawn bright and gay 
I hurried away  
Now I dream of old [C7]San Antoni[F]o

Makes me [C]yearn for her charm
And the [G7]waltz of the old Ala[C]mo
Repeat
