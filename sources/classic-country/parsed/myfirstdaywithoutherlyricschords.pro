{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[A7]Is that the sun that I see [D7]shinning
[G7]Outside my window [C]today
[F]Is that noise down the street
[Dm]The sound of [G7]children at [C]play
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]Are my eyes really [Em]seeing
[D7]The things my [G7]hands like to [C]feel
[A#7]It's my first day without her
[A7]And nothing seems real
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[Am]I tried to walk across my [D7]room
[G7]But I seem to keep losing my [C]way
[F]Everything that seemed familiar
[Dm]To me [G7]once now looks out of [C]place
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[F]My eyes never [Em]see the [Dm]things
[G7]I stumble [C]across
[A#7]It's my first day without her
[A7]And I feel kinda lost
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[D7]I start to look for things to do
[G7]That will somehow take up my [C]time
[F]I try to think of other things
[Dm]But she's all that [G7]remains in my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
[F]Will this [Em]emptiness inside never [Dm]end
[G7]Only time will [C]tell
[F]It's my first day without her
[A#7]It's my first day without her
[C]And I'm going through hell
{end_of_verse}
