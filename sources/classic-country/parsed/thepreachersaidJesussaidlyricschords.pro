{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Well with everybody tryin' to [G7]tell us what to [C]do[C7]
You [C]wonder how are you to [G7]know whose word is [C]true[F]   [C]
But the [F]preachers just keep on a [C]bringin' us the very same [D7]word
And from St. Paul to Billy Graham the same is [G7]heard
And the [C]preacher said of [G7]truth  Jesus [C]said

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well we can see that the [G7]world is full of [C]gre[C7]ed
There's [C]so much hate [G7]yet there is so much [C]need[F]   [C]
What [F]should we do when no [C]one seems to [D7]care
What can we do when there is no love [G7]there
And then the [C]preacher said of [G7]love  Jesus [C]said
{end_of_verse}

(Jesus said love Thy neighbor as Thyself)

Well please tell us the [G7]road we oughta [C]go[C7]
In [C]such confusion [G7]how are we to [C]know[F]   [C]
And if [F]there is a heaven [C]show us to its [D7]gate
Oh you'd better tell us preacher before it's too [G7]late
And then the [C]preacher said of [G7]heaven  Jesus [C]said

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Well please tell us [G7]how we can find a [C]wa[C7]y
To [C]climb every mountain [G7]that we face every [C]day[F]   [C]
And in [F]time of troubles [C]what to depend [D7]upon
To be the truth and help us carry [G7]on
And the [C]preacher said of [G7]trouble  Jesus [C]said
(Jesus said let not your heart be troubled if you believe in God 
believe also in me. In my father's house are many mansions if it were
not so I would have told you, I go to prepare a place for you. And if I
prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself.
That where I am there you may be also)
