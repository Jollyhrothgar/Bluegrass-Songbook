I packed my grip for a Klondike trip as broke as a man could [D7]be
But I dug me a hole and I found a little gold

I'm having more fun I'm a [G]son-of-a-gun [D7]it's Christmas every [G]day

There's gifts galore in the great outdoors and I live just like a [D7]king
I have a Caribou steak for my noon day break 
And I fish on the Artic ring
I [G]know every pole around the north pole [G7]from Nome to the Frisco [C]Bay
My fun never ends cause I [G]gotta lot of friends [D7]it's Christmas every [G]day

I take a little trunk to the mustic swamp 
In the land of the midnight [D7]sun 
With paragon boots and my wild Malamutes I hunt for the Salmon run
The [G]frost that gleams on the tundra scene [G7]like a jewelry store [C]display
I got a bearskin rug and my [G]little brown jug [D7]it's Christmas every [G]day
