{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I went through all my jewelry [C]took out all the golden [G]rings [C]   [G]
They were just old memories to [C]me that no longer meant a [G]thing [C]  [G]
I [C]put them in a velvet bag took them to the local jewelry [G]store
I said melt them down into a broken [D7]heart I don't need 'em any[G]more [G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Melted down [C]memories on a shiny golden [G]chain
A golden [D7]broken heart melted from a dozen [G]rings [G7]
Melted down [C]memories on the nights I cried [G]alone
From wanting love from [D7]someone I know will never be my [G]own
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The only ring I wanted was the [C]one I'll never get to [G]wear [C]   [G]
Cause the only man I ever really [C]loved wasn't free to [G]care [C]   [G]
While [C]trying to forget him I accepted many other rings of [G]gold
But they were only souvenirs [D7]without love they always left me [G]cold [G7]
