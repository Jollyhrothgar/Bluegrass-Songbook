{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]The red-headed stranger from Blue Rock, Montana
Rode into town one [G7]day
And [C]under his knees was a raging [F]black [C]stallion
And [D7]walking behind was a [G7]bay
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The red-headed stranger had eyes like [C]thunder
And lips that were sad and [G7]tight
His [C]little lost love lay [F]asleep on the [C]hillside
And his heart was [G7]heavy as [C]night
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
So don't cross him don't boss [F]him
He's wild in his [C]sorrow
He's riding and he's hiding his [G7]pain
Don't fight him don't spite [F]him
Just wait 'til [C]tomorrow
Maybe he'll [G7]ride on [C]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
A yellow-haired lady leaned out of her window
And watched as he passed her [G7]way
And [C]she drew back in fear at the sight [F]of the [C]stallion
But cast [D7]greedy eyes on the [G7]bay
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
But how could she know that the dancing [C]bay pony
Meant more to him than [G7]life
For [C]this was the horse that his [F]little lost [C]darling
Had ridden when [G7]she was his [C]wife
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
So don't cross him don't boss [F]him
He's wild in his [C]sorrow
He's riding and he's hiding his [G7]pain
Don't fight him don't spite [F]him
Just wait 'til [C]tomorrow
Maybe he'll [G7]ride on [C]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
The yellow-haired lady went down to the tavern
And looked up the stranger [G7]there
He [C]bought her a drink and he gave [F]her some [C]money
But he [D7]just didn't seem to [G7]care
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
She followed him out as he saddled his [C]stallion
And laughed as she grabbed at the [G7]bay
He [C]shot her so quick they had [F]no time to warn [C]her
She never [G7]heard anyone [C]say
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
So don't cross him don't boss [F]him
He's wild in his [C]sorrow
He's riding and he's hiding his [G7]pain
Don't fight him don't spite [F]him
Just wait 'til [C]tomorrow
Maybe he'll [G7]ride on [C]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
The yellow-haired lady was buried at sunset
The stranger went free of [G7]course
For [C]you can't hang a man for [F]killing a [C]woman
Who's [D7]trying to steal your [G7]horse
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 9}
Now this is the tale of the red-headed [C]stranger
And if he should pass your [G7]way
Stay [C]out of the path of the raging [F]black [C]stallion
And don't lay a [G7]hand on the [C]bay
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
So don't cross him don't boss [F]him
He's wild in his [C]sorrow
He's riding and he's hiding his [G7]pain
Don't fight him don't spite [F]him
Just wait 'til [C]tomorrow
Maybe he'll [G7]ride on [C]again
{end_of_verse}
