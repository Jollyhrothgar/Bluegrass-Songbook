{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Went to a dance one night 
And the beautiful music was [Em]playing
And through the [C]dim blue light
I could just see the silhouette [Em]swaying
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Then all at [F]once the room was [Em]aglow
And through the [F]couples I could [G7]see
A pair of [C]angel eyes and I was [F]hypnotized
They were [C]looking [G7]straight at [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
They played a ladies choice
And I could feel my heart beating [Em]madly
For any moment she'd ask me to [C]dance
And I would say [Em]gladly
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Then someone [F]said would you care to [Em]dance
I turned [F]around when I heard her [G7]voice
But it was [C]someone else oh how [F]sad I felt
For [C]I was the [G7]wrong ladies [C]choice
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
And when [G7]the song was through
She was alone and I caught her [C]eye
I had to [G7]make my play before
She'd dance with some other [C]guy
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
[G7]So as the [C]music played
She laid her sweet head on my [Em]shoulder
And she could [C]see the love that I felt
As though I had [Em]told her
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Was someone [F]waiting to take her [Em]home
I wondered [F]who would the luck boy [G7]be
And when the [C]dance was through all the [F]world was new
For the [C]ladies [G7]choice was [C]me [F]yeah
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
The [C]ladies [G7]choice was [C]me
[F]Mmm the [C]ladies [G7]choice was [C]me
{end_of_verse}
