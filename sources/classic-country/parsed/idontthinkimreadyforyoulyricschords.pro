{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I’ve never been scared of [Dm]love before [G7]now
But I’ve [Em]never been [Am]this much in [Dm]love
[E7]With you it [Am]happened so [C]fast that I’m [D7]afraid it won’t last
[Em]And I don’t wanna [Am]lose what my [Dm]dreams are made [G7]of
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]I don’t [E7]think I’m [F]ready for [A7]you
There are [Dm]too many heartaches I’ve already been [G7]through
But this [Em]feeling in[Am]side is getting [Dm]harder to [E7]hide
Until I [Am]know that you [C]feel it [Dm]too
[D7]I don’t think I’m [G]ready [G7]for [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Right on the edge of [Dm]out of con[G7]trol
Trying [Em]hard not to [Am]let what’s [Dm]in my heart [E7]show
But with [Am]one of your [C]kisses my [D7]will to resist is all [Em]gone
Cause I [Am]love you but [Dm]baby I know [G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]I don’t [E7]think I’m [F]ready for [A7]you
One [Dm]heart on the line’s not enough it [G7]takes two
And it [Em]wouldn’t take [Am]much
Just three [Dm]words with that [E7]touch of yours
To [Am]tell me but [G7]until you [Am]do
[D7]I don’t think I’m [G]ready [G7]for [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[G7]And it [Em]wouldn’t take [Am]much
Just [Dm]three words with that [E7]touch of yours
To [Am]tell me but [G7]until you [Am]do
[D7]I don’t think I’m [G]ready [G7]for [C]you
[D7]I don’t think I’m [G]ready [G7]for [C]you
{end_of_verse}
