[C]Long ago with a younger [F]partner 
Always in [C]love but a love for [G7]sure
Their hearts were [C]lost out in the [F]shuffle 
Of a hook and [G7]wing on a sawdust [C]floor

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Now they hold their [F]own out on the [C]liners
They're always [G7]primed for something [C]slow
And you won't [F]find them changing [C]partners
[F]Love will [C]keep in step [F]keepin' up with a [C]country set
[F]It's our kind of [C]love I'll [Am]bet 
They're [F]together every[G7]where they [C]go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now they're on in years they don't need a [F]reason
All the lights are [C]on for the same old [G7]thing
When they call let's [C]dance their song will still be [F]playing
Till the end of [G7]time their love will be in full [C]swing
