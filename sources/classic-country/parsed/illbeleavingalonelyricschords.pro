[C]Yes I'll buy you a drink if [F]you'd like me [C]to 
I might even dance a [D7]slow one with [G7]you
Lord [C]knows you're a [C7]looker and [F]honey what's [C]more
It's not hard to see what [G7]you're looking [C]for

[G7]Cause you're as [C]tempting a [C7]woman as [F]I've ever [C]seen
[G7]But there's [C]someone in [Am]Dallas who's [D7]trusting in [G7]me
She's the [C]mother of my [C7]children I'm the [F]rock she leans [D7]on
So [C]thank you but no thank you I'll be [G7]leaving [C]alone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
As we dance in the shadows you're [F]holding me [C]tight
I can feel the invitation I [D7]see in your [G7]eyes
And the [C]soft light and the [C7]music and the [F]wine's rosy [C]glow
Ain't making it easy for [G7]me to say [C]no
