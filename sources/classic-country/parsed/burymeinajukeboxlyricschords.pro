{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I've been hanging in here every night since you've been [C]gone
[A7]This old honky tonk's become my home away from [D7]home
I even [G]got my favorite chair it [C]always sits right here
[D7]There by the jukebox where I don't feel so alone
Every [G]time I put my money in I [C]hear the saddest song
My [D7]friends on the jukebox don't mind if I sing along
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
So bury [G]me in a jukebox when I [C]die
Every [A7]time I think of her I get so [D7]lonesome I could cry
And it [G]takes me up to Heaven when [C]they play A-11
Bury [D7]me in a jukebox when I [G]die
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
We used to have our favorite songs to listen [C]to
[A7]Till I came home with no one home to come home [D7]to
Now I [G]turn my radio on [C]there's all my favorite songs
[D7]Just like me they all lost someone just like you
Those [G]DJ friends of mine are [C]keeping me from dying
[D7]Knowing I don't hurt alone is what keeps me [G]alive
