[C]It was a time of the [F]preacher  when the story [C]began
Of the choice of a [G7]lady  and the love of a [C]man
How he loved her so [F]dearly  he went out of his [C]mind
When she left him for [G7]someone  that she'd left [C]behind

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And he cried like a [F]baby 
And he screamed like a panther in the middle of the [C]night
And he saddled his [G7]pony  and he went for a [C]ride
It was a time of the [F]preacher  in the year of O [C]one
Now the preaching is [G7]over  and the lesson's [C]begun
