{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I realized the way your eyes deceived [D7]me
With tender looks that I mistook for [G]love
So take away the flowers that [G7]you gave [C]me
[D7]And send the kind that you remind me [G]of
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Paper [C]roses  [D7]paper [G]roses
[E7]Oh how [Am]real those roses [D7]seem to [G]be
But they're [C]only [G][D7]im-ita-tion
[E7]Like your [Am]imitation [D7]love for [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I thought that you would be a perfect [D7]lover
You seemed so full of sweetness at the [G]start
But like a big red rose that's made [G7]of [C]paper
[D7]There isn't any sweetness in your [G]heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Paper [C]roses  [D7]paper [G]roses
[E7]Oh how [Am]real those roses [D7]seem to [G]be
But they're [C]only [G][D7]im-ita-tion
[E7]Like your [Am]imitation [D7]love for [G]me
