{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]As I'm walkin' behind this plow I keep turnin' over memories
Buried [F]treasure of a past once filled with [C]you
This old ground I know its mine and I've worked it so many times
And the [D7]rain it's been prayin' for is [G7]fallin' from my eyes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Waitin' [C]for the settin' sun when a hard day's work is done
We'd sit [F]down and rock the baby and plan our [C]dreams
But you turned it all around with this other man you found
And you [Dm]never thought I'd [F]figure out your [C]scheme[F]  [C]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And there's buried treasure hidden in the ground
Precious [F]memories of a love that lived and [C]died
You couldn't be the simple wife you had to lead the cheatin' life
And you [Dm]led me down the [F]road I hate to [C]ride
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Now the neighbors they all knew they had seen him leave with you
But what they [F]didn't see was I followed close [C]behind
And the next day's paper read that a man had been found dead
And the [Dm]lady he'd been [F]seeing they can't [C]find
{end_of_verse}
