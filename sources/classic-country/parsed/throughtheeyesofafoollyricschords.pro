[C]I'll keep [G7]looking through the eyes of a [C]fool
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
If I see someone hold her tight that's alright they're just [G7]dancing
If they're together in the moonlight they're just [C]talking  not [C][G7]romancing
If I see her out with someone it's just some old friend from [D7]school
That's how it [G7]looks through the eyes of a [C]fool
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
If her phone rings and she whispers I can talk now I don't [G7]care
A private matter and she'd rather not [C]discuss it  with [G7]me [C]there
If I see her smile at someone that's not breaking any [D7]rule
That's how it [G7]looks through the eyes of a [C]fool
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
They say that seeing is [F]believing believe me it's not [C]true
You can teach [D7]your eyes to only see the things you want them [G7]to
[C]So I'd rather keep pretending like a little child in [D7]school
And now keep [G7]looking through the eyes of a [C]fool
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Yes I’ll keep [G7]looking through the eyes of a [C]fool
