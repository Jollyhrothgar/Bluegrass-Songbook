[C]Thought I was over you  thought I could [Em]start a new
I got a [F]new job  [G7]new friends on the other side of [C]town

[G7]I can't help [C]myself  [F]here comes that [C]feeling
Just like a [F]rag-ing [G7]river rushing over [C]me

[F]Head over heels  [G7]falling for you [C]again

Why does this heart of mine  go [Em]crazy every time
When I [F]know down  [G7]deep inside you don't love [C]me

Well I'm [F]starting to make  the [G7]same old mistake [C]again
