{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Darling I am all alone in our [C]little mountain [G]home
It's empty cold and loveless now [D7]inside
For [G]your childish love and vows lasted [C]only one short [G]year
Now you’ve gone away to [C]be an[D7]other's [G]bride

You will [C]never know the [G]pain
That I felt the day you left
[C]Should you ever wed [G]again
[D7]Let me wish you love and [G]wealth
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
While that same old whippoorwill breaks the [C]silence on the [G]hill
I stand and gaze upon the faded [D7]wall
[G]Where your picture used to hang in a [C]little golden [G]frame
And a vision of your [C]smile [D7]I still [G]recall
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Though they say we live and learn from our [C]sorrows we must [G]turn
And be able to forget sad memo[D7]ries
Let me [G]wish you love and wealth may you [C]take good care of [G]yourself
But my broken heart will [C]last [D7]eternal[G]ly
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
