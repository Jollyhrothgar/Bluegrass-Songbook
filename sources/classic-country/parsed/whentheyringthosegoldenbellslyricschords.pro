[C]There's a land beyond the river 
That we [F]call the sweet [C]forever
And we only reach that shore by faith's [G7]decree
One by one we'll gain the [C]portals 
There to [F]dwell we'll be [C]immortals
When they ring those [F]golden [C]bells for [G7]you and [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Don't you [F]hear the bells now ringing 
Don't you [C]hear the angels singing
Tis a glory hallelujah jubi[G7]lee
In that [C]far off sweet forever 
Just be[F]yond the shining [C]river
When they ring those [F]golden [C]bells for [G7]you and [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
When our days shall know their number 
When in [F]death we'll sweetly [C]slumber
When the King commands the spirit to be [G7]free
Never more with anguish [C]laden 
We shall [F]reach that lovely [C]Eden
When they ring those [F]golden [C]bells for [G7]you and [C]me
