With [D7]Molly and playing mumble [G]peg
{end_of_verse}

Or play a game of stick ball in the asphalt
Free to knock a big long [Am]home run[F]

Until I [D7]cry with Charlie horses in my [G]legs
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I'd like to go down to the park

{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
And Molly Ann just might be there

And [D7]turn around and take me back that [G]far

And quickly fly across the [Am]long years[F]
Back [C]to the wondrous nights when she [D7]looked up at me
With such love in her [G]eyes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
But I was young and foolish then my mind 
Was filled with party nights and [Am]good times [F]
And [C]I lost Molly Ann somewhere 
In [D7]all the teardrops that I made her [G]cry
