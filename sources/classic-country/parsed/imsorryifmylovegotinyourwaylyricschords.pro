[C]The kindness in your heart is all that kept us [G7]together
Your kind of patience seldom comes [G7][C]along
You [C]stayed until I knew that love had left us [G7]forever
Till pride made me ashamed for hanging [C]on
I'm sorry if my love [F]got in your way 
I know that [D7]you allowed me
[G7]Time you could have spent without me
[C]For my sake you chose to take the long [G7]way of leaving
I'm sorry if my love got in your [C]way
I'm sorry if my love [F]got in your way 
I know that [D7]you allowed me
[G7]Time you could have spent without me
[C]For my sake you chose to take the long [G7]way of leaving
I'm sorry if my love got in your [C]way
