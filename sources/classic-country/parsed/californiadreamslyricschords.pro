{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Let me carry [F]that old suitcase [C]hon
And here's my hat to [F]shade your pretty [C]head from the [G7]sun
[F]Let's keep moving [G7]down the road that [C]has no end it seems
For a [F]long time we've been [C]dreaming [G7]California [C]dreams
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Where the [F]sands are gold and [C]blue the sea
[G7]Money grows from [C]every tree
It's [F]always there for [C]you and me
[G7]California [C]dreams
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
This old road gets [F]longer every [C]mile
And honey I know this is [F]no place for a [C]woman with [G7]child
But [F]soon we'll have some[G7]one to share our [C]plans and our schemes
And our [F]baby will be a [C]part of [G7]California [C]dreams
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I should have known this would be too much for you
But I thank you [F]honey for lovin' me enough [C]to come along
[G7]Cause your love is so [C]true
And it [G7]just won't be the same when I'll [C]reach California's shining sea
Cause [F]without you there beside me [C]there's just no [G7]California [C]dreams
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Where the [F]sands are gold and [C]blue the sea
