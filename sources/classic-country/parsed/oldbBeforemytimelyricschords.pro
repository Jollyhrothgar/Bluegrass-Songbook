[C]You'd like to have me take you dancin' every other night
It's gotten so my eyes are unaccustomed to daylight

The [D7]way I'm goin' soon I'll be [G7]six feet underground

You're gonna [C]make me [F]old before my [C]time
I don't know how you go on like you [G7]do
But I don't [C]mind growin' old before my [F]time
Just as [C]long as I'll [G7]grow old with [C]you

Just as [C]long as I'll [G7]grow old with [C]you
