{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I get so lonely in the [E7]silence with [F]no one to cry [C]to
No [G7]lover no [C]shoulder to [D7]cry on when I'm [G7]blue
[C]Oh silence just [E7]silence I count each [F]clock tick as time goes [C]by
I will die in the [F]silence [G7]where no one [F]hears me [G7]when I [C]cry
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
When the clock ticks (when the clock [G7]ticks)
When the wind blows (when the wind [C]blows)
When the rain falls (when the rain [G7]falls)
Or when it snows (when it [C]snows)
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I think of [G7]you oh yes [C]I think of you and your [D7]face I can [G7]see
Then I [C]wonder why I love [E7]you so and why I [F]ever let you [C]go
But you're gone now [Am]and there's [C]one thing I [G7]know
There's only [F]silence  for [C]me
