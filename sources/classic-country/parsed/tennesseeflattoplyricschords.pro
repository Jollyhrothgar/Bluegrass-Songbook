{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]In a little cabaret in a South Texas border [G7]town
Sat a boy and his guitar and the people came from all [C]around
[G7]And all the [C]girls  from there to [G7]Austin
Were slipping way from home and putting jewelry in [C]hock
[G7]To take the [C]trip  to go and [G7]listen
To the little dark haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top [C]box
And he would [F]play
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]Well he couldn't ride or wrangle and he never cared to make [G7]a dime
But give him his guitar and he'd be happy all the [C]time
[G7]And all the [C]girls  from nine to [G7]ninety
We're snapping fingers tapping toes and begging him don't [C]stop
[G7]And hypnotized  [C]and [G7]fascinated
By the little dark haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top [C]box
And he would [F]play
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Then one day he was gone and no one ever saw him [G7]around
He vanished like the breeze they forgot him in the little [C]town
[G7]But all the [C]girls  still dreamed about [G7]him
And hung around the cabaret until the doors were [C]locked
[G7]And then one [C]day  on the Hit [G7]Parade
Was a little dark haired boy who played the Tennessee flat top [C]box
And he would [F]play
{end_of_verse}
