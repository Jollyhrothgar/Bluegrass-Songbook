{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]She's on the [F]phone again wants to [C]come home again
Wants to try [G7]one more time to prove she's [C]really mine
[C7]She wants to [F]try again I know she'll [C]lie again
To take her [G7]back is wrong but I've been lonely too [C]long
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C7]The chance is [F]very slim that she's [C]forgotten him
She may be [G7]trying to hide the hurt the [C]wounded pride
[C7]There's just a [F]chance that she might recon[C]sider me
But chances [G7]are I'm wrong but I've been lonely too [C]long
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Lonely too [G7]long too long walked on [C]like dirt
Lonely too [G7]long too long oh how it [C]hurts
[C7]She knows that [F]I'll give in I'll take her [C]back again
And once more [G7]I'll be wrong but I've been lonely too [C]long
{end_of_verse}
