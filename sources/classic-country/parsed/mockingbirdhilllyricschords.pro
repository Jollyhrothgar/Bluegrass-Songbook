{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]When the [G7]sun in the morning peeps [C]over the hill
And [D7]kisses the roses 'round my [G7]windowsill
Then my heart fills with gladness when I hear the [C]trill
Of the [D7]birds in the treetops on [G7]Mockingbird Hill
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Tra-la-la twiddly-dee-dee-dee it [C]gives me a [G7]thrill
To [D7]wake up in the morning to the [G7]mockingbird's trill
Tra-la-la twiddly-dee-dee there's [C]peace and [G7]goodwill
You're [D7]welcome as the flowers on Mockingbird [G7]Hill
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Got a three cornered plow and an acre to [C]till
And a [D7]mule that I bought for a ten dollar [G7]bill
There's a tumble down shack and a old rusty [C]mill
But it's my [D7]home sweet home on Mockingbird [G7]Hill
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
When it's late in the evening I climb up the [C]hill
And survey [D7]all my kingdom while every thing's [G7]still
Only me and the sky and an old [C]whippoorwill
It's my [D7]home sweet home on Mockingbird [G7]Hill
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Tra-la-la twiddly-dee-dee-dee it [C]gives me a [G7]thrill
To [D7]wake up in the morning to the [G7]mockingbird's trill
Tra-la-la twiddly-dee-dee there's [C]peace and [G7]goodwill
You're [D7]welcome as the flowers on Mockingbird [G7]Hill
{end_of_verse}
