[G7]When you hurt me more than I [F]love [C]you
You'll pay for every time I've cried

[F]Maybe my next heartache will [C]be the [F]final [C]one
Cause [D7]maybe I won't love you when it's [G7]done
It [C]may not take but one more pain 
[F]Just one more might make the change
[G7]If you hurt me more than I [F]love [C]you
