{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I don't care if [G7]tomorrow never [C]comes 
This [F]world holds nothing [C]for me 
I've been lonely [F]night and day ever since you went [C]away
So I don't care if [G7]tomorrow never [C]comes 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
If [F]tomorrow never comes and the sun don't ever [C]shine
It won't matter with [G7]me 
For [C]when she went away  my [F]world ended that [C]day
So I don't care if [G7]tomorrow never [C]comes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
My lonely mind wanders back to [G7]days that used to [C]be
My [F]broken heart cries out for [C]you
Oh if [F]I can't have you here I can't go on my [C]dear
So I don't care if [G7]tomorrow never [C]comes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
If [F]tomorrow never comes and the sun don't ever [C]shine
It won't matter with [G7]me 
For [C]when she went away  my [F]world ended that [C]day
So I don't care if [G7]tomorrow never [C]comes
{end_of_verse}
