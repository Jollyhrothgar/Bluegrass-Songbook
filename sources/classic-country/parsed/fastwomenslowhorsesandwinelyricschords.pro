{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]I used to have money a [F]home and a [C]car
A horse and a dog and [D7]my old gui[G7]tar
A [C]pretty young wife just as [F]sweet as could [C]be
Now all I've got left is a [G7]family [C]tree
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Fast women slow [F]horses and [C]wine  
Have made me an old man a[D7]head of my [G7]time
My [C]hair once black now with [F]silver does [C]shine
On account of fast women slow [G7]horses and [C]wine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I first started playing the [F]horses for [C]fun
The years rolled along but I [D7]never once [G7]won
I [C]then started slipping [F]around on my [C]wife
And I'll regret it the [G7]rest of my [C]life

I've lost all my money my [F]wife took the [C]car
My home horse and dog and [D7]my old gui[G7]tar

And the women all swoon when he [G7]plays my gui[C]tar
