{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]He puts flowers on the hills [F]your cup He gladly fills
[C]How can you turn around and say God is [G7]dead
But when [C]your stories have all been told
There's [F]one thing I'd like to know
If God is [C]dead who's this [G7]living in my [C]soul [F]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]He gives us shelter from life's stormy weather
Gives us [F]love to keep us together
When [C]life gets like a ship on a raging [G7]sea
And [C]when the stage of life grows cold
Somebody [F]helps us to play our role
If God is [C]dead who's this [G7]living in my [C]soul [F]   [C]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G7]If my soul had windows I'd leave them [C]open so the world could [Am]see
The [F]ugly scars upon those hands that [G7]bled for you and me
[C]There's the bridge you can cross if you will
The toll was [F]paid on Golgotha's hill
If God is [C]dead who's this [G7]living in my [C]soul [F]   [C]
[F]If God is [C]dead who's this [G7]living in my [C]soul
{end_of_verse}
