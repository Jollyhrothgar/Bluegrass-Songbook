{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I'm just drift-wood on the river floating down the [G7]tide
I don't care where this old river carries [C]me
I keep drifting just because my heart is broken [F]inside
And I'm [G7]tired of wishing for what can not [C]be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I may meet some bit of drift-wood lost same as [G7]I
Share a hand shake and a tender tear or [C]two
But It's always good luck now we got to say [F]good-bye
I must [G7]wander on to keep my [C]rendezvous  
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Though I drift through town and city I can never [G7]stay
For I find no place to call my home sweet [C]home
I don't ask for help or pity I just go my [F]way
All I'm [G7]praying for is peace to dream [C]alone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I'm just drift-wood on the river and I'm drifting [G7]on
Till this weary river meets the deep blue [C]sea
Where the deep blue sea may help me to forget [F]someone
Yes the [G7]careless one who has forgotten [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
In my heart I don't feel bitter over what has [G7]been
I feel sorry for the one I must [C]forget
And instead of being someone with the world to [F]win
I'm just [G7]drift-wood on the river of [C]regret
{end_of_verse}
