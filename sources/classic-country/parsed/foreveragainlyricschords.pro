[C]I wish I could step out of my mind
Then [F]I could be someone that’s never [C]k-nown [G7]you
But I [C]can’t change the way I am much less the way you [F]feel
Or [C]you’d be loving me [G7]forever [C]still
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]I can’t stop the winter from [G7]turning into [C]spring
Or [F]summer giving way to autumn [G7]winds
But if [C]I could take the [F]world and make it [G7]face the other [C]way
[F]Then you’d love me [G7]forever [C]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
If I had a way of changing time
I’d [F]stay busy turning back the [G7][C]p-ag-es
If I [C]could make a miracle I’d make one just for [F]you
And [C]you’d be loving [G7]me forever [C]too
