{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]The childhood memories I treasure the most I [F]suppose
Are the [G7]Saturday afternoons spent at the town picture [C]show
I worked all day long in the fields but at night I would [F]dream
Of [G7]seeing Gene Autry go riding across the big [C]screen
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Saturday mornings I'd walk twenty miles or [F]more
[G7]Twelve o'clock noon found the first one in line at the [C]door
Cause all week I'd work but today I would fulfill my [F]dream
And [G7]I'd see Gene Autry go riding across the big [C]screen
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The [F]man in the white cowboy hat was a hero to [C]me
He was then he is now and I guess he always will [G7]be
Time [C]takes away many things but it can't take a [F]dream
And I [G7]can still see him go riding across the big [C]screen
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
When as a kid from our shack on the desert I'd [F]roam
My [G7]daddy would whip me cause I'd never be around [C]home
But mom understood me I know cause she'd smile when I'd [F]say
Gene [G7]Autry and I had been rounding up outlaws all [C]day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
The [F]man in the white cowboy hat was a hero to [C]me
He was then he is now and I guess he always will [G7]be
And [C]every so often I go back in time and I [F]dream
And [G7]I see Gene Autry go riding across the big [C]screen
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
And [G7]I see Gene Autry go riding across the big [C]screen
{end_of_verse}
