{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]As we journey along on [F]life's wicked [C]road
So selfish are we for silver and [G7]gold
You can [C]treasure your wealth your [F]diamonds and [C]gold
But my friend it won't save your [G7]poor wicked [C]soul
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
For when God calls from His [F]home up on [C]high
To your earthly wealth you must say [G7]goodbye
Then it's [C]useless to you if you've [F]strayed from the [C]fold
For my friend it won't save your [G7]poor wicked [C]soul
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The rich man like all will be [F]judged at that [C]time
But all of his wealth will be left [G7]behind
For no [C]matter how much earthly [F]wealth you get [C]hold
My friend it won't save your [G7]poor wicked [C]soul
My friend it won't save your [G7]poor wicked [C]soul
{end_of_verse}
