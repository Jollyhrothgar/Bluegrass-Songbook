{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Sometimes late at [Am]night 
[D7]I lie awake and watch her [C]sleep[G]ing
She's [D7]lost in peaceful dreams 
So I turn out the lights 
And [C]lay there in the [G]dark[C]
[G]And the thought crosses my [Am]mind 
[D7]If I never wake up in the [G]morning [C]  [G]
[D7]Would she ever [Am]doubt 
The [D7]way I feel [C]about her in my [G]heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
If tomorrow never [C]comes 
Will she know how much I [G]loved her
Did I try in every [D7]way 
To [Am]show her every [D7]day 
That [C]she's my only [G]one
And if my time on earth were [C]through 
And she must face this [D7]world [Em]without me
Is the love I gave her in the [Am]past 
Gonna be enough to [D7]last 
If tomorrow never [G]comes [D7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G]Cause I've lost loved ones in my [Am]life 
[D7]Who never knew how much I [G]loved them
Now I [D7]live with the [Am]regret that my true [D7]feelings 
For them [C]never were [G]revealed
So I made a promise to [Am]myself 
[D7]To say each day how much she [C]means to [G]me
And [D7]avoid that circum[Am]stance 
Where there's no [D7]second chance 
To tell her how I [G]feel[C]  [G]

[G]So tell that someone that you [Am]love 
Just what you're thinking [D7]of
If tomorrow never [C]comes[G]  [Am]   [G]
