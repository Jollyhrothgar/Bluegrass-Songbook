{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I rushed home from work like [F]I always [C]do
I spent my whole day just [D7]thinking of [G7]you
[C]When I walked through the front door [F]my whole life was [C]changed
[F]Cause nobody [C]answered [G7]when I called your [C]name
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
A note on the table that [F]told me good[C]bye
It said you'd grown weary [D7]of living a [G7]lie
[C]Your love has ended but [F]mine still [C]remains
[F]But nobody [C]answers [G7]when I call your [C]name
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Oh the lonely [C7]sound of [F]my voice [C]calling
Is driving me in[G7]sane
[C]And just like [C7]rain the [F]tears keep [C]falling
[F]Nobody [C]answers [G7]when I call your [C]name
Repeat last verse
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Oh [F]nobody [C]answers [G7]when I call your [C]name
