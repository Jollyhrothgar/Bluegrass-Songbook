{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]We're over
[F]I guess you [G7]know we're [C]over
[F]Even [G7]though all the [Am]words are still [Em]unsaid[F]
And we [Dm]talk of other [G7]things instead
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
We're [C]over
[F]We come and [G7]go we're [C]over
[F]We go [G7]on like the [Am]actors in a [Em]play[F]
Acting out [Dm]our lives from [G7]day to day [Dm]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Going [G7]through our phrases
With smiling frozen faces
That [Am]tell more than they hide
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
And [G7]knowing when we fake it
It's [F]not love when you make it
[C]Without any [F]feeling in[G7]side
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
We're [C]over
[F]That's all we [G7]are we're [C]over
[F]And all [G7]that's left [Am]is to find a reason [Em]why [F]
We're [Dm]over and we still can't [G7]say good[C]bye
{end_of_verse}
