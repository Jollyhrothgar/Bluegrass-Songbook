Cause I'm proud to be [D7]Lefty's old [G]guitar
Filled with memories of [D7]a [G]superstar

I'll just [D7]hang here on this wall and [C]remember it [G]all
And the [A7]good times out weigh the [D7]bad by far

I'm a simple star of [D7]Lefty's old [G]guitar

Saginaw Michigan [D7]was always a [G]favorite of mine

We traveled many years together [D7]playing one night [G]shows

Lord I've give the world to do [D7]it all over [G]again
