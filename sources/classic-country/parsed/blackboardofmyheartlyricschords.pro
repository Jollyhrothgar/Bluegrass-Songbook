{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]When I was young and I went to school they taught me how to [D7]write
To take the chalk and make a mark and hope it turns out [G]right
Well that's the way it is with love and [G7]what you did to [C]me
I wrote it so you'd [G]know that I was [D7]yours [G]eternally
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But my tears have washed I love you from the blackboard of my [D7]heart
It's too late to clean the slate and make another [G]start
I'm satisfied the way things are [G7]although we're far [C]apart
My tears have washed I [G]love you from the [D7]blackboard of my [G]heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
If you'd been true the way you should and not have gone [D7]astray
Those tears would not have fallen down and washed the words [G]away
No need to talk cause if the chalk should [G7]write those words [C]again
It will be for [G]someone else not [D7]things that might have [G]been
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But my tears have washed I love you from the blackboard of my [D7]heart
It's too late to clean the slate and make another [G]start
I'm satisfied the way things are [G7]although we're far [C]apart
My tears have washed I [G]love you from the [D7]blackboard of my [G]heart
{end_of_verse}
