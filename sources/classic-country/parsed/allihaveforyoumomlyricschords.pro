[C]We've been looking through a window at an [F]orchid mother [C]dear

To [C]thank you for your many prayers that [F]heaven only [C]knows
But all we have for [G7]you mom is this [C]rose

We [F]tried to buy that orchid and [C]mom I'll tell you why
Every [F]day should be Mother's Day for [G7]you
[C]It's not much to say we love you but [F]still we hope it [C]shows
Though all we have for [G7]you mom is this [C]rose

When our life is over and we [F]hear the trumpet [C]blow
We'll meet you up in heaven on that [G7]day
God [C]will hand to you that orchid as He [F]takes you in His [C]fold
But all we have for [G7]you mom is this [C]rose
