{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]It’s hard sweetheart to try and hide my [D7]feelings
Not [G7]let it show each time you come [C]inside
But I brush your arm and feel your eyes [D7]on me
And [G7]something seems to fall apart [C]inside
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
It’s so hard to pretend I don’t [D7]want you
As [G7]yet I haven’t learn to hide my [C]eyes
Cause all you have to do is come close [D7]to me
And [G7]something seems to fall apart [C]inside
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Re[F]membering all the [G7]things we’ve known [C]together
Gives [D7]me a feeling that’s so hard to [G7]hide
[C]To be in reach and still not reach and [D7]touch you
Makes [G7]something seems to fall apart [C]inside
{end_of_verse}
