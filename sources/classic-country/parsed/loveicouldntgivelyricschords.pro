{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Across the room an empty bed 
Just barely cold from where your body [Dm]warmed it
The [G7]tingle of your woman feel 
Still lingers like your footsteps in the [C]hall
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The [C7]final desperation of my reaching 
For the only love that [F]makes me want to [Dm]live
And I [G7]curse the need that drives you to the man 
Who helps you find the love [F]I couldn't gi[C]ve
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
If I could give your mind a voice 
And hear the thoughts that lie behind [Dm]your needing
I [G7]could be the kind of man to help you 
Satisfy the hungering you [C]crave
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
And [C7]if I had to I would even sell 
My very soul to [F]Satan in the [Dm]deal
To [G7]fill the need that drives you to a man 
Who helps you find the love [F]I couldn't gi[C]ve
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The [C7]final desperation of my reaching 
For the only love that [F]makes me want to [Dm]live
And I [G7]curse the need that drives you to the man 
Who helps you find the love [F]I couldn't gi[C]ve
