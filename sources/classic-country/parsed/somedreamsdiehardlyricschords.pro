{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Sometimes I think I'm [Dm]over you
[G7]And free to love [C]again
And a part of me lets [Dm]go of you
[G7]But my heart keeps giving [C]in
And giving in to [Dm]memories
[G7]And dreams that won't [C]come true
Sometimes I think I'll [Dm]never be
[G7]Really over [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Dreams die [Am]hard when they don't come [C]true
Dreams die [Am]hard there's nothing you can [C]do
And dreams die [Am]hard and when they do you [Fm]cry
It's [F]hard to find a [C]new dream
[G7]With tears in your [C]eyes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Sometimes I go a [Dm]week or two
[G7]And you never cross my [C]mind
It seems I'm finally [Dm]over you
[G7]And I've left the past [C]behind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
When I see someone who [Dm]looks like you
[G7]Walking down the [C]street
But I know it's not [Dm]really you
[G7]But my heart still skips a [C]beat
{end_of_verse}

Dreams die [Am]hard when they don't come [C]true
Dreams die [Am]hard there's nothing you can [C]do
And dreams die [Am]hard and when they do you [Fm]cry
It's [F]hard to find a [C]new dream
[G7]With tears in your [Am]eyes
It's [F]hard to find a [C]new dream
[G7]With tears in your [C]eyes
Repeat last verse
