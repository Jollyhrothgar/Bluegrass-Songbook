{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Sadness all that's a teardrop [F]fall from your baby's [G7]eyes
And [F]regret should be the [G7]feeling [F]cause it's you that made her [C]cry
And shame is the [C7]price you pay for [F]being so un[D7]kind
And [C]loneliness is the [G7]just reward [F]for that one too many [C]times
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
For that [G7]one too many times may be your [C]last time ([F]last [C]time)
And your [F]last chance to show you're [D7]really not that [G7]kind
You may [C]fool around and put her down just to [F]see what she will [D7]do
But [C]that just this once [G7]may be the one [F]too many times for [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Too many [G7]times too much pride inside to [C]cry again ([F]cry a[C]gain)
And to [D7]satisfy your childish games [G7]you always have to win
And what [C]will you say was the cause when she’s [F]gone and she's [D7]gone
You can [C]blame it on your [F]one too many [C]times
