{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Nothing between  lost [F]love and [C]lonely 
Just a few broken [G7]vows and a million old [C]dreams
The days are so long and the [F]nights last [C]forever
When you live day to day [G7]with nothing [C]between
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Once we were [G7]close there was so much between [F]us
When love filled our [G7]world as we planned and we [C]dreamed
Then something went wrong  now [F]we seems like [C]strangers
So far [G7]apart with nothing [C]between
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Nothing between  [F]your love and my [C]love 
No plans being [G7]made to fulfill our [C]dreams
We don't speak love words  [F]anymore like we used [C]to
Something is [G7]wrong there's nothing [C]between
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
It's just a short walk [G7]from love to [C]lonely 
With no happiness [G7]anyplace to be [C]seen
You're still here with me  [F]though many miles separate [C]us
Your heart and [G7]mine has nothing [C]between
{end_of_verse}
