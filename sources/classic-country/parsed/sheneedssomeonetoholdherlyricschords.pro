She packed her few [F]belongings left a [C]note and now [F]she’s [C]gone
And I can’t stand to think of her out there so all [G7]alone

And she needs someone to [F]hold her when she [C]cries
Someone who really [F]understands the [C]way she feels [G7]inside

[F]With no one there to [C]hold her when [G7]she [C]cries

Someone [C]who’ll always hold her when [G7]she [C]cries
