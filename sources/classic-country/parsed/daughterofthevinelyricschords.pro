{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]A blind man can see darkness and [F]when the shadows [C]fall
I quickly close the curtains of my [G7]mind
I [C]hear the voice of yesterday so [F]sweetly when it [C]calls
And I reach for the [G7]daughter of the [C]vine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Happiness is dead and gone my [F]dreams have flown [C]away
Like captive birds free from the trap of [G7]time
To[C]morrow is a silent song [F]forgotten yester[C]day
When I turn to the [G7]daughter of the [C]vine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The [F]fingers of forgetfulness [C]caress my troubled brain
And gently wipes her memory from my [G7]mind
Those [C]healing hands of happiness [F]soon take away my [C]pain
As I reach for the [G7]daughter of the [C]vine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
On the sea of sorrow their [F]pride's a sinking [C]ship 
So abandon it and leave your hopes [G7]behind
Your [C]crutches are not broken al[F]though your wings are [C]clipped
You'll be rescued by the [G7]daughter of the [C]vine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
The [F]fingers of forgetfulness [C]caress my troubled brain
And gently wipes her memory from my [G7]mind
Those [C]healing hands of happiness [F]soon take away my [C]pain
As I cling to the [G7]daughter of the [C]vine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
As I cling to the [G7]daughter of the [C]vine
