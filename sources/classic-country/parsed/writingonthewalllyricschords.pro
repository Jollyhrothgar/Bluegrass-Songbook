{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]She was holding back the tears
[C]As I packed up the last few years
[G]And said I'm tired of [E7]being so tied [A7]down
[G]I'm sure the kids will understand
[C]That daddy's making other plans
I [G]grabbed my bags and I [D7]was freedom [G]bound
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And then I saw the [C]writing on the [G]wall
It said we love you [C]daddy most of [D7]all
[G]There in purple crayons scribbled knee high in the [C]hall
[D7]I saw the writing on the [G]wall
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
When the new wore off of being free
[C]Their memories starting haunting me
[G]I headed home as [E7]fast as I could [A7]go
[G]My key still fit that same old door
But no one lived there [C]anymore
And [G]that tender message [D7]made my teardrops [G]flow
{end_of_verse}
