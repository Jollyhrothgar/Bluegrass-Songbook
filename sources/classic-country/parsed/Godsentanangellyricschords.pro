{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I was troubled in my mind and had [C7]reached my darkest time 
When my [F]life and my spirit was [C]low
I walked out on a span of the [C7]bridge made by man 
And looked [D7]down at the water so [G7]cold

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [C]stood shivering there on the [C7]edge of despair
Knowing [F]well I was going to [C]fall 
With the [F]end drawing near I had [C]no mortal fear 
For I had never [G7]known Him at [C]all
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
But God [G7]sent an [C]an-[C7]gel that [F]only [G7]my eyes could [C]see
He was [F]dressed all in white and [C]surrounded by light
Oh thank God for the [G7]love shown to [C]me 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
For the rest of my days God [C7]will show me the way 
Since His [F]messenger entered my [C]life 
I’m a part of His plan for [C7]salvation of man
As I [D7]walk in his circle of [G7]life
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Never [C]more will I doubt what my [C7]life's all about 
And no [F]more will I suffer de[C]spair
I've got [F]proof He's alive [C]for He let me survive 
And I know He's made a [G7]home for me [C]there
