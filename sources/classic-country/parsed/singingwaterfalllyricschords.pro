[C]There's a singing waterfall in the [F]mountains far [C]away    
That's where I long to be at the [D7]close of every[G7]day
That's [C]where my sweetheart's sleeping [F]down beneath the [C]clay
I [F]often sit and [C]wonder why the [G7]Lord took her [C]away

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
We'd meet there every evening when the [F]sun was sinking [C]low
And we'd listen to the waters as they [D7]rippled soft and [G7]low
And [C]since she's gone to Heaven [F]I miss her most of [C]all
To[F]night my darling's [C]sleeping by the [G7]singing water[C]fall
{end_of_verse}

Last night as I lay dreaming I [F]heard my darling [C]call  
And then I went to meet her by the [D7]singing water[G7]fall    
She [C]took me in her arms just [F]like she used to [C]do
And t[F]hen I heard her w[C]hisper we'll meet [G7]beyond the [C]blue
We'll meet [G7]beyond the [C]blue
