{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Well I think I finally found me a surefire way to forget
It's so simple I'm surprised I hadn't done thought of it before yet
It's full proof well it's full hardly maybe but who knows
Anywhere here I am walkin' toward where the cold dark waters flows
It's all it takes

And free from pinin' for the love I can't forget
The love that once was warm and then just somehow turned to hate
Made my life a prison from which there's only one escape
