{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Cozy lairs and easy chairs ain't hard to bear 
When the weather's cold and [F]bad
[G7]But when the birds sing in the spring
Them scenes on TV screens drive my mind [C]mad
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Punching clocks and gettin' docked 
For being late just ain't my cup of [F]tea
So [G7]I told the boss man where to go
And not to waste his breath cussin' [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Cause my lungs is gettin' hungry for some air
That ain't been breathed a million [F]times
And [D7]I'd like to think that I might think some thoughts
That never crossed another [G7]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Cause I'd [C]rather be a thinker than
Be satisfied with what a tinker [F]knows 
And [G7]be a puppet on a string 
And shake with fear each time I hear the [C]wind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Joke of things like wedding rings 
And apron strings ain't never been my [F]style
Clinging [G7]vines and ties that bind 
Can't blind me to the sweet call of the [C]wild 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
So come the morning woman 
Brew me up a jug of coffee strong and [F]black 
And I'll [G7]kiss domesticated bliss goodbye 
And make my final farewell [C]tracks
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Cause my lungs is gettin' hungry for some air
That ain't been breathed a million [F]times
And [D7]I'd like to think that I might think some thoughts
That never crossed another [G7]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Cause I'd [C]rather be a thinker than
Be satisfied with what a tinker [F]knows 
And [G7]be a puppet on a string 
And shake with fear each time I hear the [C]wind
