[C]There’s no telling how many [F]hearts you caused to [C]break
And if the truth was known you’ve caused a [F]tear in every [C]state
Oh but I don’t worry about it cause I [F]know that you will [D7]call
And up till [C]now I’ve [F]been your [C]favorite [G7]fool of [C]all
{end_of_verse}

You know I’ll be there just as [F]sure as April [C]rains
And don’t you know that if you were a [F]picture I’d be the [C]frame
You’ve got me living in a prison although I [F]didn’t break the [D7]law
And we both [C]know that [F]I’m your [C]favorite [G7]fool of [C]all
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Oh [F]I wish that I could stand my ground [C]whenever [G7]you come [C]around
But you just as well be telling me not to [G7]breathe
After [F]all this time of standing in your [C]life again I’ll [F]fall
I guess I’ll [C]always [F]be your [C]favorite [G7]fool of [C]all
{end_of_verse}
