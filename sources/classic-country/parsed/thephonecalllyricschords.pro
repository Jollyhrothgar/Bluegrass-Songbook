{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[F]Oh I've been driving all night long 
And I'm finally in her town
[C]Pulling off the freeway [G7]looking for a tele[C]phone
[F]As I dial the number from a booth outside I call
[C]Thinking about the last time [G7]when I held her [C]in my arms
[A#7]Said hello then ask can [F]I see you to[Am]night
[G]Then there was only [A#7]silence on the [G7]line
Then she [C]said
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh I'd really like to see you again
It's getting late and I'm expecting a friend
And [F]after all it just wouldn't be right
I think it's better that we say goodnight
And I [C]hung up the phone
The last time you came though this town
You built me up then you let me down
And [F]I'm being careful with this heart of mine
I've been getting along just fine without [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]Oh baby before you go won't you please let me explain
[C]I've changed a lot since [G7]way back then
I'm a [C]different kind of man
[F]It took awhile but now I know that I left the best behind
[C]And I don't wanna [G7]sleep alone in some [C]hotel room tonight
[A#7]But no matter what I said her [F]voice was cold as ice
[G]Even begged her to give me one last [G7]try
But she [C]said
