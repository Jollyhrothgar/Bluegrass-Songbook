It's not a little bitty feeling I got a big big [C]love

I think it's time we done some [F]walking 
I think it's time we done some [C]talking
Cause there's a [D7]great big moon above [G7]and we got a big big love
This is not infatu[C]ation this is a true love [G7]sensational
It's not my imagination I got a big big [C]love for you
