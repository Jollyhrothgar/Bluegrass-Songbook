{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]At last you have made up your mind to [G7]leave me
And yet you say you'd really rather [C]stay
For quite a while I've known that this would [G7]happen
But I never dreamed that it would be [C]today
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You tell me that you've had not found [G7]another
But as you do you look the other [C]way
For you know how it hurts me don't you [G7]darling
So you see there's nothing more for me to [C]say
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now what's the use for me to keep on [G7]crying
I'd gladly do it if I thought it [C]takes
But when that love light in your eyes stopped [G7]shining
I knew that there was nothing more to [C]say
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I'll treasure all the years we spent [G7]together
And every kiss still burns within my [C]heart
And when you're old and gray just please [G7]remember
In my life you still play the leading [C]part
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
So leave me now before I cry please [G7]do dear
May you never suffer as I have [C]today
I think you know just what I mean my [G7]darling
So really there is nothing more to [C]say
{end_of_verse}
