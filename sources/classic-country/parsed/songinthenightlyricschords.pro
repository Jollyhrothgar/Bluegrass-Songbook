{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]The whole world's asleep  [B7]and it's so quiet here
I [C]can feel your heart beat [G]as I hold you near
Then I [C]feel you touching me and I [G]hear this beautiful sound
It's a [A7]melody soft and sweet it's the [D7]love I found
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And it's a [G]song in the night and it feels so right [C]lying next to you
When you [D7]touch me this way the music plays the [G]whole night through
And love's melody serenades me when you [C]hold me tight
I [D7]hear violins and love begins with a [G]song in the night
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The sweetest music I know  [B7]is the sound of your name
And [C]when the lights are low I sing it [G]over and over again
When [C]you give yourself to me [G]and we love the night away
A [A7]symphony inside of me [D7]starts to play
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And it's a [G]song in the night and it feels so right [C]lying next to you
When you [D7]touch me this way the music plays the [G]whole night through
And love's melody serenades me when you [C]hold me tight
I [D7]hear violins and love begins with a [G]song in the night
