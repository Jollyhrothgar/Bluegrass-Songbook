{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I can never remember the joy we once [G7]knew
And I seem to forget all the times you were [C]untrue
But the moment you left me is still on my [F]mind
Some of those [C]memories [G7]hurt me all of the [C]time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The days when you loved me I can never [G7]recall
But the nights when you cheated I remember them [C]all
Oh that last lonely night when you left me here [F]behind
Some of those [C]memories [G7]hurt me all of the [C]time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]If I could remember [C]heart of the happiness
Then [F]maybe I wouldn't have to cry [D7]all alone like [G7]this
[C]I'm always thinking of the many times that you [G7]lied
Instead of thinking of the many times that you [C]tried
Oh why I can't free myself from this prison of memories that [F]bind
Some of those [C]memories [G7]hurt me all of the [C]time
{end_of_verse}
