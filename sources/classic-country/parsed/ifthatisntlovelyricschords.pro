{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]He left the [D7]splendor of [G]heaven
[C]Knowing His [G][D7]des-tiny
Was the lonely hill of [C]Golgotha
There to [G]lay down His [D7]life for [G]me

If that isn't [C]love then the ocean is [G]dry
There's no stars in the [D7]sky
And the sparrow can't [G]fly
If that isn't [C]love then heaven's a [G]myth
There's no feeling like [D7]this
If that [G]isn't [G][C]love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Even in death [D7]He [G]remembered
[C]The thief [D7]hanging by His [G]side
He spoke with love and [C]compassion
Then He [G]took him to [G][D7]para-dise
{end_of_verse}
