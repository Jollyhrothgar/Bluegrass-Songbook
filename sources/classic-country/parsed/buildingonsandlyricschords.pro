{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]They're building great mansions
But they're [C7]building on [F]sand
Their treasures are [C]worthless
When before God they [G7]stand
The [C]rock of Salvation is [C7]Jesus [F]alone
So build on Him [C]brother He [G7]cares for His [C]own
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Here so many are searching for [C7]pleasure each [F]day
They don't take the [C]time to kneel down and [G7]pray
They're lost yes they're [C]sinking 
In the [C7]quick-sands of [F]time
No thought of salvation [C]of God's [G7]love [C]divine
