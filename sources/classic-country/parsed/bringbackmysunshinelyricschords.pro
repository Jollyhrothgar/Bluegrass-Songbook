[C]Girl it's not [Dm]easy [G7]  being [Em]alone[Am]
When all my friends [Dm]see me[G7]
And ask what went [C]wrong
I catch my[F]self saying [A7]things[Dm]
I [G7]never thought of [Em]before [Am]
Hiding my [A#7]feelings
Behind some closed [Dm]door[G7]

Bring back my [Dm]sunshine[G7]  
Make the rain go [C]away[Em]
Let's [A7]look for the [Dm]good times[G7] 
They were here yester[C]day 
Let's catch the [F]first moment [C]back 
To [Dm]those feelings [G7]we left be[Em]hind[A7]
Oh come back to [Dm]me love 
[G7]Bring back my [C]sunshine

It seems like [Dm]ages [G7]  since we let it [Em]end [Am]
Let's turn back the [Dm]pages[G7]
To where love [C]began 
And pick up the [F]pieces of [A7]dreams
We left [Dm]shattered like [G7]old broken [Em]glass[Am]
And this time we'll [A#7]make it
We'll make it [Dm]last[G7]
