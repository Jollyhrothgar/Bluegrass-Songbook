{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I saw your picture in the [C]paper Sunday [G]morning
Lord you sure looked pretty in your [A7]gown [D7]
The [G]smile you were wearing was the [C]one I re[G]membered
And your hair was never prettier [D7]except when it was [G]down
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Yeah I saw your picture in the paper Sunday [C]morning
And to say the [G]least it took me by surprise
I must have sat and looked at it for Lord I don't know how long
[A7]Just thinking what was going [D7]on behind those eyes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I [G]read the whole description about the music and the [C]bride's maids
I'll [G]bet your daddy threw a fit 
When he had to get [D7]dressed up in that tux and [G]tie
And I noticed where your sister came home from [D7]Texas
I know [G]you were glad to see her 
And knowing your mama she probably cried
But then [D7]so did I
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[G]I saw your picture in the [C]paper Sunday [G]morning
By then the honeymoon was almost [A7]through [D7]
But [G]now you've made your bed and I [C]hope you lie well [G]in it
And I hope you'll both be happy you see [D7]I still lie well [G]too
I saw your picture in the [C]paper Sunday [G]morning
{end_of_verse}
