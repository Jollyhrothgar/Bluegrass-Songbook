{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I kiss him good[C]night and tell him I [G]love him 
Then I keep my rendez[D7]vous
[C]Knowing that when I go to [G]sleep 
[D7]I'm gonna dream about [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [D7]can't make my dreams under[C]stand that it's [G]wrong
To [A7]dream about you when [D7]with him I belong
I've [G]made vows to [C]God and I've made vows to [G]man
But I [D7]just can't make my dreams under[G]stand
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
My fingers are [C]crossed when I say I'm [G]happy 
But lying just don't make it [D7]right
[C]And each night when I go to [G]sleep 
[D7]I dream you are holding me [G]tight
{end_of_verse}
