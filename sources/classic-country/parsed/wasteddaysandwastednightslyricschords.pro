{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G7]Wasted days and wasted [C]nights I have left for you be[G7]hind
For you don't belong to me your heart belongs to someone [C]else      
Why should I keep loving you when I know that you're not [G7]true
And why should I call your name when you're to blame for making me [C]blue
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C7]Don't you re[F]member the days that you went away and [C]left me
I was so [D7]lonely prayed for you only my [G7]love
Why should I keep loving [C]you when I know that you're not [G7]true            
And why should I call your name when you're to blame for making me [C]blue
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
D[C7]on't you rem[F]ember the days that you went away and l[C]eft me
I was so [D7]lonely prayed for you only my [G7]love
Why should I keep loving [C]you when I know that you're not [G7]true            
And why should I call your name when you're to blame for making me [C]blue
