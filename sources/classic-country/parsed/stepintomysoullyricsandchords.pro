{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]If you could step into my soul 
For just [G7]a little while
You'd feel like a man condemned 
And [F]walking your last [C]mile
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You'd be without a cause to live 
With the [C7]mind of a [F]child
Yes I'm what you could [C]turn into 
If [G7]you let your memories run [C]wild
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I'm a [G7]man you can say who [D7]fell by the way
Too far gone for her love to [G7]save
Oh sure I complain but I [D7]know who's to blame
It was me who drove her [G7]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
If you could [C]step into my soul 
You'd [G7]know how it feels
When love leaves a wound 
That [F]time just can't [C]heal
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
To walk through a lonely world 
Where you [C7]long for just a [F]smile
Yes I'm what you could [C]turn into 
If [G7]you let your memories run [Am]wild [G7]   [C]
{end_of_verse}
