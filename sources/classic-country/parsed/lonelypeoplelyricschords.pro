[G]Late at night a disc jockey plays a [D7]sad song by request
For some lonely [Am]girl in a [D7]one room world whose [G]tears won't let her [D7]rest
For she [G]lives every word of the song she just heard
As she [G7]clutches her pillow so [C]tight
She's [G]just one of those lonely [D7]people in the [G]night[D7]

It's [G]three a.m. in New York City [D7]but the wino he doesn't know
His [Am]bottle is [D7]empty his pockets are empty [G]where did his pals all [D7]go
He shared with them and he cared for them
[G]For a while everything was all [C]right
Now [G]he's one of those lonely [D7]people in the [G]night

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Just [C]look at the lonely people in this [G]world
[D7]There's too many [Am]women without a man [D7]and boys without a girl
[G]If we lonely people could find one another
What a happy [G7]world this could [C]be
For there's too many [D7]lonely people just like [G]me
