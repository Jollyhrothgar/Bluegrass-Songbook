{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Falling [D]leaves that lie scattered on the [G]ground
The birds and [A]flowers that were here now can’t be [D]found
All his [D]friends that he oince had are not [G]around
They are [A]scattered like the leaves upon the [D]ground.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Some folks [D]drift along through life and never [G]thrill
To the [A]feeling that a good deed brings [D]until
It’s too [D]late and they are ready to lie [G]down
Beneath the [A]leaves there scattered on the [D]ground.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Lord let my [D]eyes see every need of every [G]man;
Let me [A]stop and always lend a helping [D]hand
Then when [D]I’m laid beneath that mossy [G]ground
There’ll be more [A]friends around than leaves upon the [D]ground.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
To your [D]grave there’s no use taking any [G]gold;
It’s no [A]use when it’s time for hands to [D]fold.
When you [D]leave this world for a better home some [G]day
The only [A]thing you’ll take is what you gave [D]away.
{end_of_verse}
