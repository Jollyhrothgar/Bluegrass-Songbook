{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
You [D]wouldn’t [D7]read my [G]letter if I wrote you
You [A7]asked me not to call you on [D]the phone
But there’s something [D7]I’m [G]wanting to tell you
So [A7]I put it in the words of [D]this song
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
I didn’t know [D7]God made [G]honky tonks angels
I [A7]might have known you’d never make [D]a wife
You gave up the only [D7]one that ever [G]loved you
And went [A7]back to the wild side [D]of life
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The [D]glamour [D7]of the gay [G]night life has lured you
To [A7]the places where the wine and [D]liquor flow
Where you [D7]wait to [G]be anybody’s baby
And forget [A7]the truest love you [D]will ever know
{end_of_verse}
