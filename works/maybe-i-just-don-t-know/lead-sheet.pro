[C]You came to me [F]like a dove on the [C]wind
As great as your beauty [G7]was your freedom with[C]in
You said to me [F]the things on your [C]mind
But I didn't help you [G7]I couldn't un[C]wind

Maybe I [G7]should have held you [C]
Maybe I [G7]should have tried [C] 
Maybe I [G7]could have helped you [F]
Through the [G7]night[C]
Maybe I [G7]should know better[C] 
Sometimes which [G7]way to go [F]
Maybe [G7]I just don't [C]know
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Sometimes the ground [F]looks as hard as a [C]rock
But sometimes it's muddy [G7]and so hard to [C]walk
Sometimes the beauty [F]is covered with [C]snow
Sometimes the right seems the [G7]wrong way to [C]go
