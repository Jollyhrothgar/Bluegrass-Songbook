{start_of_verse}
We went down the road we two together
To the old churchyard in the village there
The roads been changed and the people have wandered
The bell doesn’t ring there’s no preaching there
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Turn back turn back ye wayward pilgrim
Come back come back to the peaceful shore
Turn back turn back for the Savior’s waiting
To rescue you from the brink of woe
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
My mind went back to the days of my childhood
When we went to church in the village there
The pews were full and in the aisle were standing
The people who came to worship there
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I’d like to go back to the days of my childhood
And go to church in the village there
And meet my friends and old acquaintance
And sing again in the village square
{end_of_verse}
