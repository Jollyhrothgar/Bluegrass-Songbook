{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Her Mercedes Benz is parked right outside
Ring on her finger man it's a sight for sore [F]eyes
But now it's losing its [C]shine
A memory that she thought had died
Came back to life when he drove by her [F]house today
And took her [C]breath away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
She's caught between a [Am]rock and a [F]soft [C]place
Between what's [Am]right and the [F]heart[G7]ache
Should she [F]turn her back on everything and [G7]walk away
Or [E7]leave it where it [F]lays
Looks like she's [Dm]caught between a [G7]rock and a soft [C]place
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Lying together in the still of the night
Blanket on the ground holding onto each [F]other tight
In the pale moon[C]light
The memories that she made with him
Are just as strong as when he stole her [F]heart away
Like he's doing [C]today
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
She's caught between a [Am]rock and a [F]soft [C]place
Between what's [Am]right and the [F]heart[G7]ache
Should she [F]turn her back on everything and [G7]walk away
Or [E7]leave it where it [F]lays
Looks like she's [Dm]caught between a [G7]rock and a soft [C]place
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[A#7]Diamonds and gold don't [F]make the perfect [C]man
Should she [A#7]give up everything she [Dm]wants for everything she [G7]has
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Should she [F]turn her back on everything and [G7]walk away

Whoa whoa  [G7]rock and a soft [C]place
