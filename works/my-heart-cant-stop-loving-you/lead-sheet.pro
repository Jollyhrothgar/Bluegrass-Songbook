{start_of_verse}
The day’s are so lonely without you by my side
You told me that you loved me but I guess that you lied
If you could see me here sittin’ all alone
You’d think of the love we shared and come back home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Forget that I love you forget that I cried
Leave every memory of me behind
If it’s all over please tell me that it’s true
But darling my heart can’t stop loving you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I waited so long to find a new love
And I know that time will heal my broken heart
But still there’s a thing or two I cannot forget
Just like those words of love that said we never would part
{end_of_verse}
