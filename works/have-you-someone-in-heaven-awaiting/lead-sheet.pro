{start_of_chorus}
Have you someone in [G]heaven [D]a’waiting
Expecting you on that beautiful [A]shore
Be ready to [D]join [G]that great band [D]of angels
When they welcome you into that [A]heavenly [D]door
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Come sinners take heed while [G]Jesus [D]is waiting
Please never be caught in the pathway of [A]sin
For Jesus may [D]call [G]your name in [D]the morning
When heaven’s gates open will [A]you [D]enter in
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The vision will hear the [G]prayer of [D]the sinner
No matter how dark no matter how [A]late
He’ll welcome you [D]home to [G]the [D]heavenly mansion
Take a straight narrow way to that [A]beautiful [D]gate
{end_of_verse}
