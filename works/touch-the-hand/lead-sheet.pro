{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Spoken:
[C]Today I heard my woman say something I never heard her say before
She just told me she was going to leave me 
And that she didn't love me anymore
But I know that the love and kindness and the understanding
That she had when I first met her is still there somewhere
So I'm going to get down on my knees and I'm going to say to my baby

[C]I was the [G7]first man to [C]ever   hold you in a [G7]special kind of [C]way
And those unfamiliar [C7]feelings that [F]caused you to [C]tremble 
[Am]I know you [D7]remember the [G7]day
[C]Before you [G7]decide you're gonna [C]leave me
And do things you've [G7]never done [C]before

The two lips [G7]that once held sweet [C]surprises 
Surprised me and [G7]said goodbye [C]today
And those two loving [C7]arms that [F]used to reach [C]for me 
Just [Am]reached out and [D7]pushed me [G7]away
[C]I know you [G7]believe you don't [C]love me
Before [G7]you walk out that [C]door
