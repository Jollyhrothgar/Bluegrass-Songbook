I made a big mistake when I introduced her to my friend
[G7]And gave him a chance to dance with her
[C]As I watched them in the crowd I could hear my heart beat loud
[G7]Cause it meant goodbye to me when she said hello to [C]him
[G7]Hmm hmm hmm   hmm hmm hmm  hmm hmm hmm  hmm hmm [C]hmm

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
She just held on to his hand when it was break time for the band
[G7]And it was plain to see that I'd lost out
[C]So I slipped away to cry felt so low I could die
[G7]Cause it meant goodbye to me when she said hello to [C]him
[G7]Hmm hmm hmm   hmm hmm hmm  hmm hmm hmm  hmm hmm [C]hmm

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Is there anywhere to go where a broken heart won't show
[G7]Everyone must know what's wrong with me
[C]They can tell by my ways I go round lost in the days
[G7]Cause it meant goodbye to me when she said hello to [C]him
[G7]Hmm hmm hmm   hmm hmm hmm  hmm hmm hmm  hmm hmm [C]hmm
