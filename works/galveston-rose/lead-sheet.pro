{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Down in old southern Texas I [F]wandered one [C]day
[D7]Where the tropical sea breezes [G7]blow
[C]I there fell in love with a [F]flower so [C]rare
[G7]And they called her the Galveston [C]rose
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]Her heart was as true as her blue smiling [C]eyes
[D7]And as pure as the lily that [G7]grows
[C]And the finest of gold in no [F]way could [C]compare
[G7]With the curls of my Galveston [C]rose
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G7]I grew jealous and falsely accused her one [C]day
[D7]Said her love I no longer should [G7]know
[C]I’ve been true please believe me her [F]little heart [C]cried
[G7]But I left her my Galveston [C]rose
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[F]Little then did I think that sometimes I’d [C]repay
[D7]And would reap every sorrow and [G7]care
[C]But as years passed along I grew [F]lonely each [C]day
[G7]For the one I had left waiting [C]there
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[G7]So I wrote to my darling and said I was [C]wrong
[D7]I’ll return dear if you’ll only [G7]wed
[C]But soon came a letter my [F]flower had [C]died
[G7]And these are the words that I [C]read
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
[F]Your sweetheart is peacefully sleeping [C]tonight
[D7]In a grave where the white violets [G7]grow
[C]And enclosed there’s a curl a [F]last token of [C]love
[G7]And a note from your Galveston [C]Rose
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
[G7]I was innocent dear though you left me [C]alone
[D7]But remember I loved only [G7]you
[C]And the lock that’s enclosed is [F]a curl from your [C]rose
[G7]Who’ll be waiting in heaven for [C]you
{end_of_verse}
