[C]This time I'm walking to New Orleans
I'm walking to New [F]Orleans

When I get through walking these [F]blues
When I get back to New [C]Orleans

I've got my suitcase in my hand
Now ain't that a [F]shame
I'm leaving here [G7]today
Yes I'm going back home to [F]stay
Yes I'm walking to New [C]Orleans
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
You used to be my honey
Till you spent all my [F]money
No use for [G7]you to cry
I'll see you bye and [F]bye
Cause I'm walking to New [C]Orleans
