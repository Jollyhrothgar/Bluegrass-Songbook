{start_of_verse}
We were waltzing in the light of the old Virginia moon
As the fiddles played their music so low
I was happy as a king with the girl of my dream
Until she whispered sweetheart I must go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Oh I’ll never forget the night when we met
You found me when my heart was low
Now my heart will always yearn
‘Til the day when you return
And we’ll dance to the Old Virginia Waltz
{end_of_chorus}
