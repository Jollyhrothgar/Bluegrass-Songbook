{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]You've gone so [D7]far away my [G]darling
Each [C]time I think of you I cry
I'll press your picture to my [G]bosom
Then I'll [D7]feel that you're close [G]by
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The years have [D7]passed you've not re[G]turned dear
[C]Now they say that you have died
But your soul will live [G]forever
Now I [D7]know you'll be close [G]by
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I saw you [D7]last while you were [G]leaving
The [C]tears from you I tried to hide
You took me in your arms and [G]said dear
Your memo[D7]ry I keep close [G]by
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
They've buried [D7]you in a lonely [G]graveyard
And a [C]spot they've left beside
Now we'll sleep 'til Jesus [G]calls us
So that [D7]we can be close [G]by
{end_of_verse}
