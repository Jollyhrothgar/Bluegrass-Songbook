{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I heard the front door  [C]closing [G]softly
[D7]As I wakened  from my [G]sleep
[C]With the last touch  of her lips [G]Lord
[D7]Like a whisper  [G]on my [G7]cheek
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]And I cursed the sun for [G]rising
[D7]For the worst Lord is yet to come
[G]Cause this morning  [C]she's just [G]leaving
[D7]But come sundown  she'll be [G]gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]See the lipstick  on the [G]pillow
[D7]That I placed  beneath her [G]head
[C]And the soft sheets  still feel warm [G]Lord
[D7]Where she lay  [G]upon my [G7]bed
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]And it hurts to know it's [G]over
[D7]For the hurt Lord has just begun
[G]Cause this morning  [C]she's just [G]leaving
[D7]But come sundown  she'll [C]be [G]gone
{end_of_verse}
