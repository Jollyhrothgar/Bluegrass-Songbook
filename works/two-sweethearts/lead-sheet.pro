I’m in [D]love [G]with two
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
One [G]has hair of silver gray
The [C]other one is just [G]like gold
One [C]is young [G]and youthful too
The other is [D]aged and old
But [G]dearer than life are they both to me
From [C]neither would [G]I part
One [C]is my mother [G]God bless her I love her
The [D]other one is my [G]sweetheart
{end_of_chorus}
