{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]When you [F]walked out of my life I didn't [C]think that I'd survive
Hope was growing [F]dimmer day by [C]day
But [F]much to my surprise Lord I [Am]made it out alive
And my [C]world is looking [G7]anything but [C]gray
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I came thro[F]ugh with flying [C]colors
A little black and [F]blue from the wear and [C]tear
But love [F]got the best of me and I turn [C]green with jealou[Am]sy
When you [D7]made it crystal clear you did not [G7]care
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I came [C]thro[F]ugh with flying [C]colors
My eyes are [F]red from cryin' the whole night [C]through
I should [F]win the Purple Heart cause you [C]tore mine all [Am]apart
But I came [D7]through with flying [G7]colors after losing [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Yes I've [F]got a yeller streak cause I [C]know your past is weak
And I [F]still get pale whenever you're in [C]sight
I’m a [F]shade out of my mind oh but [Am]I'm not color blind
Cause I've [C]learned that love ain't [G7]only black and [C]white
{end_of_verse}
