{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Forty [A]years I’ve [D]been gone
I served [A]my time it’s been [E]so long
I took [A]a life I know it [D]was wrong
I served my [A]time lord [E]knows I’m [A]going home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Shackled [A]to a ball [D]and chain
I worked in [A]the snow I worked in [E]the rain
I laid [A]the tracks never rode [D]the train
Forty years [A]of [E]suffering forty years [A]of pain
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I had a [A]wife and a [D]little queen
I’ve had a [A]son I’ve [E]never seen
All I have [A]left now [D]it seems
Is a broken [A]heart [E]and [A]broken dreams
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now [A]I’m old, I’ve done [D]my time
Ain’t nothin left but to sit and pine
Nobody [A]here even knows [D]my name
I have no [A]one [E]but myself [A]to blame
{end_of_verse}
