{start_of_verse}
Well I don’t nobody nobody loves me
All they want’s my money they don’t care for me
I want to live single happy and carefree
I don’t love nobody nobody loves me

One day I went out walking walking down Johnson street
I met a little old lady she smiled at me so sweet
Said hello my honey how are you today
Just as I started to kiss her these words I heard her say

One day I went out walking walking down Johnson street
I met the same little lady she was dressed up so near
She smiled at me and said hello how are you today
Tipped my hat and said hello and journeyed on my way
