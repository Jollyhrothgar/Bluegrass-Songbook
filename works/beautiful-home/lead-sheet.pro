{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
There’s [G]a beautiful home [C]far over [G]the sea
With mansions of [D7]bliss for you and [G]for me
A beautiful home so [C]wondrously [G]fair
That the savior for [D7]me has gone to [G]prepare
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
There’s a beautiful [D7]home (a beautiful [G]home)
far over the sea (far over the sea)
There’s a beautiful [D7]home (a beautiful [G]home)
for you and for me (for you and for me)
Its glittering powers (its glittering powers)
of sun out shine (of sun out shine)
That beautiful home (that beautiful home)
someday shall be [D7]mine  (someday shall [G]be mine)
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
In that beautiful home a [C]crown I [G]shall wear
With the glorified [D7]throng their stories [G]to share
But the doors of that [C]home can never [G]be known
Til the savior we [D7]see upon His [G]white throne
{end_of_verse}
