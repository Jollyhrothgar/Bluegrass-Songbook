{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]There's no magic way  [F]for me to get [C]over you
There's not much left to [G7]say  and not a thing left to [C]do
Seldom I laugh  [F]and seldom I ever [C]cry
But there's times I [D7]drink too much and there's times when I [G7]lie
Sometimes I [C]hate myself [F]and wish I could [C]scream
Sometimes I give [G7]up on love but sometimes I [C]dream
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Sometimes I dream  [F]looking out through my [C]window
Speeding through the [G7]night in a long limou[C]sine
There's a curse on my heart [F]and I'll never [C]love again
I'm forever a [G7]lonely man but sometimes I [C]dream
{end_of_verse}
