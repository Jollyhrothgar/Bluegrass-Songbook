{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Thought I'd stop by awhile [G7]and see [C]you 
Just once more before I leave [F]town
But his car's parked there in your [C]driveway 
And I see the curtain's pulled [G7]down
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]I won't bother to ring [G7]your [C]doorbell 
I'm not sure just how much I can [F]bear
I might do something I'd be sorry for [C]later 
So I won't come in [G7]while he's [C]there
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Does he know my whole [G7]world is in there with [C]him
That he's [G7]king while he sits there in my [C]chair
I'd like to tell you just how much I still love [F]you
But I [C]won't come in [G7]while he's [C]there 
No I [C]won't come in [G7]while he's [C]there
{end_of_verse}
