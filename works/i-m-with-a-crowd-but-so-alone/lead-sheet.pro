{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Tonight with another I'm [C]dancing 
And we're [G]smiling at the rest of the [D7]crowd
But [C]I can't help wondering [G]about you 
And your new love of [D7]whom you're so [G]proud
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
At [D7]night I'm never [G]alone 
I'm [A7]afraid that I'll weaken and [D7]phone
And I'm [C]afraid that you will be [G]gone 
I'm with a crowd [D7]but oh so [G]alone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I still have the picture you [C]gave me 
You [G]signed it with love you'll [D7]recall
And the [C]one of me that you [G]wanted 
Is it now hanging [D7]face to the [G]wall
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
At [D7]night I'm never [G]alone

I'm with a crowd [D7]but oh so [G]alone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
As long as I can keep [C]smiling 
Maybe [G]I can fool the world don't you [D7]see
And [C]perhaps some day I'll [G]forget you 
And lose this heartache that [D7]you left with [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
At [D7]night I'm never [G]alone

I'm with a crowd [D7]but oh so [G]alone
