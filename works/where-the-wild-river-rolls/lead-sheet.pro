Where [D]can I [F]find some [C]peace for [D]my mind
I [D]feel that my [F]heart has [A]grown [A]cold

So [D]I’m bound [A]where the wild [D]river [D]rolls

I’m [F]bound [C]where the wild river [D]rolls[D]
I’m [F]bound [C]where the tall pine trees [A]grow[A]
The [D]cost of [F]your love has [C]taken its [D]toll
So [D]I’m bound [A]where the wild [D]river [D]rolls

So [D]I’m bound [A]where the wild [D]river [D]rolls
