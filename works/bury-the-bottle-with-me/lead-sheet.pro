[Em]There's a [G]stone in yonder [Em]graveyard

These [C]things it can't [G]repeat

All I [C]had was a [G]barroom
And I [C]drank away my [G]life

So [Em]bury the bottle with me
For [G]it's what tore me [G7]down

When [C]they put me in the [G]ground
When they [C]lower my body [G]down
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
A drunker is a [Em]sinner
On [G]this I place no [G7]doubt
Oh the [C]Lord won't share His [G]palace
With the [C]things he lives [G]without

Now the [C]bottle is what [G]took my soul
And [C]petrified my [G]brain
