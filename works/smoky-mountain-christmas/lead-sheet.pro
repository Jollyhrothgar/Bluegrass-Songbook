{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I'm dreaming of a Smoky Mountain [F]Christmas
With [G7]the kids around the fireplace stringing popcorn for the [C]tree
I'm dreaming of a Smoky Mountain [F]Christmas
With [G7]nothing much that money buys but everything worth while in life
Dreamin' of a Smoky Mountain [C]Christmas
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You can take the girl from the country [F]I have heard 'em say
But you'll [G7]never take the country from the [C]girl
And me I've been a rambler for the [F]better part of life
But no [G7]matter where I ramble in this [C]world
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I keep dreamin' of a cabin in my [F]Smoky Mountain home
[G7]Rememberin' my life there as a [C]child
Just as free as the butterflies the [F]hummingbirds 
And bees as [G7]different as the snowflakes on the windows of my life
