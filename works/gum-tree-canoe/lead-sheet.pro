{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
On the [G]Tom Big [C]Bee [G]River so bright I was born
In a hut made of husks of [C]the tall [D]yellow corn
It was [G]there that I [C]first met [G]my Julah so true
And I rowed her [C]around in [D]the gum [G]tree canoe
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Sing [G]row away [C]row o’er [G]the [D]waters so blue
Like [G]a feather [C]we’ll float in [D]my gum [G]tree canoe
Sing [G]row away [C]row o’er [G]the [D]waters so blue
Like [G]a feather [C]we’ll float in [D]my gum [G]tree canoe
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
All [G]day in [C]the fields of [G]soft cotton I’d hoe
And think of my Julah [C]and sing [D]as I go
I’d [G]catch her a [C]bird with [G]a wing of true blue
And at night row her [C]around in [D]the gum [G]tree canoe
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
With [G]my hand on [C]my banjo and [G]my toe on the oar
I would sing her a song to the [C]river’s [D]soft roar
While the [G]bright stars [C]shone down on [G]my Julah so true
And they danced in [C]her eyes [D]in the gum [G]tree canoe
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
One day the old river took us so far away
That we couldn’t get back so we [C]thought we’d [D]just stay
We [G]spied a tall [C]ship with [G]a flag of true blue
And she took us in [C]tow in [D]the gum [G]tree canoe
{end_of_verse}
