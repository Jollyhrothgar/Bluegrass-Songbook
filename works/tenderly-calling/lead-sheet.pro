Sometimes [G]when I’m [C]feeling lonesome [G]and none on earth seems [D]to care
I’m [G]all by myself in [C]the darkness [A]with no one and nothing [D]to share
Just [G]when it feels like [F]it’s [C]over [B7]and I’ll never [Em]make it alone
I [C]hear the voices [G]of [Em]angels [G]tenderly [D]calling [G]me [D]home
{end_of_verse}

Home [G]come [D]on [G]home[G7]
Ye [C]who are weary [G]come home
Softly [C]and tender they [G]call [Em]me
Home [G]come [D]on [G]home[G7]
{end_of_chorus}

I [G]try to keep [C]it together and [G]I never let on that [D]I’m scared
till [G]sometimes I fall [C]to [A]pieces scattered and lost [D]everywhere
and [G]just when it feels like [F]it’s [C]hopeless [B7]and I’ll never [Em]make it alone
I [C]hear the voice [G]deep [Em]inside me [G]it’s [D]tenderly [G]calling [D]me home

Don’t [G]be afraid of [C]the [G]darkness don’t run away from [D]the storm
stand [G]up and face [C]your reflection [A]and feeling’s you try [D]to ignore
cause [G]after the tempest [F]is [C]over [B7]and you let yourself [Em]go on thru
you’ll [C]hear a voice in [G]the [Em]silence [G]it’s [D]tenderly [G]calling [D]to you
