{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I went tonight and joined a group of merry making friends
I [D7]thought perhaps I'd get you off my [C]mind and smile [G]again
But a pretty girl walked in and made me [G7]feel like crawling [C]out
She looked so much like [G]you oh there's [D7]one in every [G]crowd
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
In [C]every crowd of people there's a [G]face or there's a sign
[D7]Something to remind me that your [C]love's no longer [G]mine
I forget you for a moment then I'm [G7]happy and I'm [C]proud
But it only takes a [G]memory and there's [D7]one in every [G]crowd
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And there I was recalling things I went there to forget
I [D7]guess my trouble is I loved you [C]then and I love you [G]yet
I found myself a corner and hid my [G7]face and cried out [C]loud
And I heard somebody [G]whisper there's [D7]one in every [G]crowd
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
In [C]every crowd of people there's [G]somebody just like me
[D7]Unable to erase the dreams that [C]never came to [G]be
I forget you for a moment then I'm [G7]happy and I'm [C]proud
But it only takes a [G]memory and there's [D7]one in every [G]crowd
{end_of_verse}
