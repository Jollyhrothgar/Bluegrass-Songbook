{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Is there any [Bbdim]mail for me was the question [Bm]that he asked
Of the [E]postman at the closing of [Asus4]the [A]day
But he turned away and cried while the tears stood in his eyes
As he [D]drooped his head [Em]and slowly [D]walked away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Was it from a [G]gray haired Mother or a Sister or a Brother
He [G]waited all these many years [D]in vain
Of’t from early morning light he would wait till dark of night
For a [D]letter but [Em]alas it [D]never [Bbdim]came
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
As he waited all these years joy mingled with his tears
His poor [E]soul had fleeted out with [Asus4]the [A]time
In his hand he held a note and those simple words he wrote
If [D]your letter comes [Em]just place it [D]by my side
{end_of_verse}
