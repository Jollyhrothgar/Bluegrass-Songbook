{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]You ask me why my heart's so [C]sad
[G]And why the teardrops fill my [D7]eyes
[G]A heart can't sing that's filled with [C]pain
[G]How can it [D7]laugh when it [G]cries
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]I saw my dreams all fade and [G]die
[D7]Like castles in the blue
[G]Each dawn will bring more tears and [C]pain
[G]I've lost the [D7]only love I [G]knew
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]Oh life for me is useless now
[G]It seems so empty and [D7]blue
[G]There's no more use to try [C]again
[G]I fail in [D7]everything I [G]do
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]It's hard to know you'll never [G]have
[D7]The one you love so true
[G]While the world's asleep I'll lay and [C]cry
[G]I've lost the [D7]only love I [G]knew
{end_of_verse}
