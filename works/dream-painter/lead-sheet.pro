He took my world of [Am]emptiness and [F]framed it up with [G7]happiness
And [F]touched up all my lonely yester[G7]days

That [F]I've seen my last [G7]drop of rain
From [F]now on there'll be sun[G7]shine all the [C]way

Before I held him [Am]in my arms un[F]til he came into [G7]my heart

But [F]it just don't seem [G7]fair to have so [C]much
