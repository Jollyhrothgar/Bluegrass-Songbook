{start_of_verse}
When this evening sun goes down
Then in heaven I will be found
I will end life’s other side
When I cross the great divide
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
When this evening sun goes down
When I wear my starry crown
When I’ll see a smiling face
And rest in amazing grace
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
He will wipe away my tears
He will blind me to all my fears
Then in joy I’ll ever be bound
When this evening sun goes down
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
When this evening sun goes down
When they lay me ‘neath the ground
When we’ll meet, weep, and mourn
Then I’ll be in my heavenly home
{end_of_verse}
