{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Way up on old Linville Mountain
Where the bear and the catamount reign
A strange ghostly light appears every night
Which no scientist or hunter can explain.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
In [D]the days of the old covered wagon
When [Bm]they camped on the flats for [D]the night
With [Bm]the moon shinin’ dim [D]o’er the old canyon rim
They [D]watched [A]for [D]that brown mountain light.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
High [D]on the mountain
And [Bm]down in the valley [D]below
It shines like the crown of an angel
And [Bm]fades as the mists come [A]and go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Way [D]over yonder
Night [C]after night [D]until dawn
A faithful old slave comes back from [Bm]the grave
Is [D]searching for [A]his master who’s [D]long gone.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Many [D]years ago a southern planter
Came [Bm]huntin’ in this wide world [D]alone
Then [Bm]so they say the [D]hunter lost his way
And [D]never [A]returned to [D]his home.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
His [D]trusting ol’ slave brought a lantern
And [Bm]searched but in vain day [D]and night
Now the ol’ slave is gone
but his spirit lingers on
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
And [D]the lantern it [A]still casts [D]it’s light.
{end_of_verse}
