I was searching for fortune and [D]fame[E]
I found where the water [A]runs deep from [E]the hills
They [A]call it [E]the [A]medicine springs
They [A]call it [E]the [A]medicine springs

It [E]was there that I met a fair maiden
Yellow hair and big eyes of [D]blue[E]

That [A]she’d [E]forever [A]be true
That [A]she’d [E]forever [A]be true

Well [E]I wanted the best for my darlin’
But my pockets were empty and [D]bare[E]

I [A]took what [E]another [A]man had
I [A]took what [E]another [A]man had

As [E]I sit here alone in this jailhouse
With a letter I can’t hardly [D]read[E]

She’s a [A]waitin’ [E]in heaven [A]for me

Some [E]day I’ll go back to the mountains
Where I’ll spend the rest of my [D]days[E]
And the water that runs frome the [A]side of [E]the hill
Will [A]water [E]her [A]flowery grave
Will [A]water [E]her [A]flowery grave
{end_of_verse}
