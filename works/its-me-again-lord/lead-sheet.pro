{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Troubles [G]come [C]and I can’t find [G]an answer
Lonely nights I spend in [D]agony
I [G]have no [C]other friend that I [G]can turn to
So here I am Lord [D]back upon [G]my knees
It’s me again Lord I’ve [C]got a prayer I need [G]an answer
It’s me again Lord I’ve got a problem I can’t [D]solve
Well [G]I don’t mean to worry you [C]but here I am facing something new
And [G]I need help that only comes from [D]You it’s me [G]again Lord
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I know You’re mighty [C]busy in [G]Your Heaven
Forming worlds and hanging stars to [D7]shine
But [G]You promised if [C]I’d ask that I [G]could see them
So here I am Lord [D]asking one [G]more time
