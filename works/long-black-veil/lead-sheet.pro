{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Ten years ago on a cool dark night
There was [D]someone killed beneath the [C]town hall [G]light
There were [G]few at the scene and they all did agree
That the [D]man who ran looked a [C]lot like [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The [G]judge said, "Son, what is your alibi?
If you were [D]somewhere else then [C]you won't have to [G]die"
I [G]spoke not a word although it meant my life
I had [D]been in the arms of my [C]best friend's [G]wife
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
She [C]walks these [G]hills in a [C]long black [G]veil
She [C]visits my [G]grave where the [C]night winds [G]wail
[G]  Nobody knows, no, and [C]  nobody [G]sees
[C]  Nobody [D]knows but [C]me[G]
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The [G]scaffold was high and eternity neared
She [D]stood in the crowd and [C]shed not a [G]tear
But [G]sometimes at night when the cold wind moans
In a [D]long black veil she [C]cries over my [G]bones
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
She [C]walks these [G]hills in a [C]long black [G]veil
She [C]visits my [G]grave where the [C]night winds [G]wail
[G]  Nobody knows, no, and [C]  nobody [G]sees
[C]  Nobody [D]knows [C]but [G]me
{end_of_chorus}
