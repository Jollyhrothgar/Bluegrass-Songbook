{start_of_chorus}
Like the Mountain Laurel in the grove dear
My love is it’s ever green
Like the Mountain Laurel finds the grove dear
I’ll find you again
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
Where the mountain breezes blow
There’s a place I long to go
You’ll be waiting there I know
In the pine and we’ll climb
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Into the hills we knew in days gone by
When your heart was gay and so was I
And we’ll find a love we left behind
Long ago long ago
{end_of_verse}
