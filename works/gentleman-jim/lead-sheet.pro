The sun's setting slowly [G7]beyond the last hill
As a chorus sings softly to a [C]world waiting still
A heart sleeping sadly and [F]lights growing dim
Adi[C]os amigo [G7]Gentleman [C]Jim[G7]
{end_of_verse}

When he [C]lifts up his head and [G7]then began to sing
Was like carolers in Christmas or [C]birds in the spring
Such joy and such sunshine re[F]flected in him
Adi[C]os amigo [G7]Gentleman [C]Jim
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
And [F]God while I'm walking one [C]day will grow sweeter
When [G7]sadness and wonder wanted to in[C]spire
So [F]Jim listen to me one [C]favor please do me
[D7]Come sing in my heavenly [G7]world
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Well the [C]long day is over and the [G7]good race is run
And the world smiles much brighter [C]for things Jim has done
A place in God's glories [F]is this where we end

[F]Adi[C]os amigo [G7]gentleman [C]Jim
