{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[D7]Every time I ask my [G]heart
Should I take another [C]chance
I'm reminded at the [D7]start
I'm so foolish with [G]romance
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[D7]Every time I ask my [G]heart
Why can't love be all it [C]seems
Must it always end this [D7]way
Nothing left but empty [G]dreams ([C]empty [G]dreams)
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
But my [C]heart doesn't know the reason [G]why
All it [A7]knows is that it wants to cry[D7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
But I guess I'll fall [G]again
Though I know it isn't [C]smart
And I feel it with each [D7]beat
Every time I ask my [G]heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[D7]But I guess I'll fall a[G]gain
Though I know it isn't [C]smart
And I feel it with each [D7]beat
Every time I ask my [G]heart
{end_of_verse}
