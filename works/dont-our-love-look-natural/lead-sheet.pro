{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
We’re [G]gathered [C]in [D7]this room [G]today
To say our last goodbye
Friends and kin folk stay away
It’s down to you and I
It’s just a simple service
And much too late to say
Those [A7]tender words unspoken [D]yesterday
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Now [D]don’t our love [D7]look natural [G]lying there
You could [C]almost expect it to get right up [G]and care
It faded in [B7]it’s prime [C]and died before it’s time
Now [D]don’t our love [D7]look natural [G]lying there
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I know the day our love was born
But i don’t know when it died
I think we could have saved it
But it seems nobody tried
A love like time can slip away
And vanish with the dawn
And [A7]you can’t bring it [D]back
No When it’s gone
{end_of_verse}
