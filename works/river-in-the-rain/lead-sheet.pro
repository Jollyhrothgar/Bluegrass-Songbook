{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]River in the [F]rain 
Sometimes at night you look like a long white [C]train 
Winding your way away [G7]somewhere 
River I love you don't you [C]care  
If you're on the run winding [F]someplace 
Just trying to find the [C]sun 
Whether the sunshine whether the [G7]rain 
River I love you just the [C]same
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But sometimes in a time of [F]trouble 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
When you're out of hand
And your muddy bubbles roll across my [C]floor 
[F]Carrying away the things I treasure 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Hell that ain't no way to measure
[C]Why I love you more than I did the day [G7]before 
River in the [F]rain 
Sometimes at night you look like a long white [C]train 
Winding your way away from [G7]me
River I've never seen the [C]sea 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But sometimes in a time of [F]trouble 
{end_of_verse}
