{start_of_verse}
If our love should fade like a cold winter day
Don’t blame it all on me
Their true love has flown I have known friends will say
Don’t blame it all on me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
There was a time dear when we were so gay
I heard you say love only you
But some day with the dawn all our love may be gone
Don’t blame it all on me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Now you left and know all our love is so wrong
Don’t blame it all on me
For there was a time when our love was a song
Don’t blame it all on me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
For after all dear I too have a heart
You have it now don’t break it apart
Someday our romance may break up just by chance
But don’t blame it all on me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
You just can’t go on with no smile in your heart
Don’t blame it all on me
Our friends they all say that we too soon must part
Don’t blame it all on me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Now if you’ll change dear I will change too
And maybe then we’ll find love anew
Someday with the dawn all our love may be gone
But don’t blame it all on me
{end_of_verse}
