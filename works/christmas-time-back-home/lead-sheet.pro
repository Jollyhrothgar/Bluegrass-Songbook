[G]Back up in the mountains in the old home town of [C]mine
There's not a brighter [G]time of year than that of Christmas [D7]time

[C]Christmas bells are ringing I [G]hear their chimes so sweet

A world of joy and [G]peace on earth back [D7]home at Christmas [G]time
{end_of_verse}

A candle in each window they give a golden [C]glow
While out among the [G]shimmering pines lights sparkle in the [D7]snow
And [G]through the lonely mountain tops the wind shrill echoes [C]sigh
For peace on earth good[G]will toward men and [D7]faith that will not [G]die

High above our little town so bright to be so [C]fine
There shines upon the whole [G]wide world His gift our guiding [D7]star

And know the joy the [G]Yuletide brings to [D7]all at Christmas [G]time
