{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
See [A]that [G]train [A]coming round the bend,
Carrying the [G]one that [E7]I love
Her [A]beautiful [D]body [A]is still here on earth,
But her [A]soul [E7]has been called [A]up above
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Body [A]and [G]Soul, [A]Body [D]and Soul,
That’s [A]how she loved me, [E7]with Body [A]and Soul
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Her [A]beautiful [G]hair was [A]the purest of gold,
Her eyes were as [G]blue as [E7]the sea,
Her [A]lips were [D]the color [A]of summer’s red rose,
And she [A]promised she [E7]would always [A]love me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Tomorrow [A]as [G]the [A]sun sinks low
The shadows will [G]cover [E7]her face
As [A]her last sun [D]goes down, [A]she’s laid beneath the ground
And my [A]teardrops [E7]are falling [A]like rain
{end_of_verse}
