And [C]the Lord saw [D7]fit to [C]furnish [G]elbow [D7]room

Have you [G]ever been [G7]down to [C]Colorado 
I [D7]spend a lot of time there in [G]my [D7]mind

I'll [D7]bet that's where he spends most of his [G]time

If by [G]chance you dare to be high [C]upon a [G]mountain
I’ll [C]swear that [D7]you can [C]hear [G]the angels [D7]sing
