{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G7]I'm [C]sitting on the [G7]corner of the [F]roughest street in [C]town
Where [G7]fools who lose and [C]never win are [D7]scattered all [G7]around
I [C]thought I wouldn't [G7]miss you but [F]your leaving changed my [C]mind
Cause [F]love ain't such an [G7]easy thing to [C]find
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [G7]guess I thought myself right out of your [C]affection
And [G7]heaven knows that I just wanted you for [C]mine
I [G7]should've kept you by my side as my po[C]ssession
Cause [F]love ain't such an [G7]easy thing to [C]find [G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
If [C]I can shake this feeling that's [F]wrapped all over [C]me
I'll [F]find that bright [C]tomorrow that now I just can't [G7]see
Don't [C]laugh at me for [G7]crying Lord I [F]know I'm not [C]blind
Cause [F]love ain't such an [G7]easy thing to [C]find  [F]
Cause [G7]love ain't such an easy thing to [C]find
{end_of_verse}
