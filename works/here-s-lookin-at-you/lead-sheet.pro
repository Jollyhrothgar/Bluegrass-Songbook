{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]When the light from the beer sign [G7]shines on your face
It shines on your wedding ring [C]too
And I know you consider telling [F]me about [D7]him
So [C]consider what [G7]I'm telling [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
There are songs for a quarter on [G7]every jukebox
Songs of cheating and back street [C]affairs
Songs that we dance to held [F]hands and made [D7]plans to
The [C]Lord knows I can't [G7]hold on to [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Here's looking at you feeling the way that I [Dm]do
One [G7]last round of red wine and a toast for the good times we [C]knew
Here's looking at you feeling the [C7]way that I [F]do
I can't [G7]take those tomorrows with a love that feels borrowed from [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I can't wait for the moment when the [G7]telephone rings
And you whisper where we'll ren[C]dezvous  
I can't face one more long night of [F]sleeping a[D7]lone
While [C]his body [G7]lies next to [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Here's looking at you feeling the way that I [Dm]do
One [G7]last round of red wine and a toast for the good times we [C]knew
Here's looking at you feeling the [C7]way that I [F]do
I can't [G7]take those tomorrows with a love that feels borrowed from [C]you
