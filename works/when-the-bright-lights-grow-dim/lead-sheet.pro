{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I’m the [E]laugh of the party out every night
Ain’t got a worry [B7]but then
The [A]people who say I’m carefree and gay
Don’t [B7]know how I’m lonely when the bright lights [E]grow dim
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
People [E]think cause I’m laughing the past is behind
But they don’t know the sorrow [B7]within’
A [A]heart that is hurtin’ in a man bound by pride
Who [B7]cries for an old love when the bright lights [E]grow dim
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
When [E]the party has ended the laughter has died
And I think of our parting [B7]again
The [A]smile leaves my face and tears take its place
I [B7]cry for you darling when the bright lights [E]grow dim
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
So [E]until you return I’ll keep wearing a mask
That will hide how I’m feeling [B7]within
So [A]if your lonely too I’ll be right there with you
I’ll [B7]be thinking of you dear when the bright lights grow [E]dim
{end_of_verse}
