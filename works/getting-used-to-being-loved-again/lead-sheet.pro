{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I'll get reacquainted with some [D7]feelings I once knew
[G7]I thought they were gone for good till [C]I was touched by you
Haven't wanted to be wanted since I [D7]don't remember when
Am I [Dm]getting used to [G7]being loved [C]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You sure made a difference for it's [D7]only been awhile
And [G7]it was all that I could do to [C]even make a smile
But yesterday I laughed out loud while [D7]facing all my friends
Must be [Dm]getting used to [G7]being loved [C]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
An [E7]old familiar tune was moving [F]up and down my spine
A [C]feeling that's a [G7]long time over [C]due
[E7]Maybe I just needed someone [F]here to help me find
That [Dm]love won't always break a heart [G7]into
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I'd for[C]gotten just how warm a pair of [D7]loving arms can be
But [G7]every time you hold me now it [C]all comes back to me
It's looking like this heart of mine is [D7]finally on the mend
Am I [Dm]getting used to [G7]being loved [C]again
I guess I'm [Dm]getting used to [G7]being loved [C]again
{end_of_verse}
