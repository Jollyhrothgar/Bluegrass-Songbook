{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I'd be the last one to tell you that you shouldn't [G7]go
[C]And the first to say be happy if you can
[F]But when you lie and hurt someone who needs and loves you so
[C]Do you mind too much if [G7]I don't [C]understand
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G7]I suppose that you're convinced this is the thing to do
[C]Life is short and sweet break all the hearts you can
[F]I guess I shouldn't be surprised it's all a game to you
[C]But do you mind too [G7]much if I don't [C]understand
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G7]Forgive me but it all seems so [F]unreal to [C]me
[G7]And my heart and me we’d made so many [C]plans
[C7]But that's all over now there's nothing left [F]to do
[C]But do you mind too [G7]much if I don't [C]understand
{end_of_verse}
