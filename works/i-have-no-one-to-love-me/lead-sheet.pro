When my [A]darling started to [D]leave me
And [A]sail on [E]the deep [A]blue sea

He [A]promised to write me a [D]letter,

And I [A]haven’t heard from my [D]darling,
Who [A]is sailing on [E]the deep [A]blue sea

Farewell [A]to friends and [D]relations

By [A]drowning in the [E]deep [A]blue sea
{end_of_verse}
