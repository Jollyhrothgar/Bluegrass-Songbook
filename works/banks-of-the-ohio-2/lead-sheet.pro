{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I asked [G]my love to take [D]a walk
Just to walk a [G]little ways
And as we walked along we [C]talked
All about our wedding day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Only [G]say that you’ll [D]be mine
In no others arms [G]entwined
Down beside where the [C]waters flow
On the [G]banks [D]of the [G]Ohio
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I took her by her lily white hand
I dragged her down that bank of sand
There I threw her in [C]to drown
I watched her [G]as [D]she [G]floated down
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Returning [G]home between twelve [D]and one
Thinking of what a deed I’d done
I’d killed the girl I loved [C]you see
Because [G]she [D]would not [G]marry me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
The very next day about half passed four
The sheriff’s men knocked at my door
He said young man come now and go
Down to [G]the [D]banks of the [G]Ohio
{end_of_verse}
