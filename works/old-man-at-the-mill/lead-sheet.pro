{start_of_chorus}
Same [G]old man sitting at [F]the mill
The [G]mill turns around of its [C]own [C#]free [D]will
Hand [G]in the hopper and the other in the [F]sack
Ladies [G]step forward and the [D]gents [G]fall back
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Down sat an owl and he said all quiet
Lonesome [G]day and [C]a [C#]lonesome [D]night
Thought [G]I heard a pretty [F]girl say
Court [G]all night and you [D]sleep next [G]day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Well [G]then, said the raven [F]as she flew
If [G]I was a young [C]one [C#]I’d [D]get two
One [G]for to fetch and the other [F]to sew
I’d [G]have a string for my [D]bow, [G]bow, bow
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
My [G]old man’s in [F]Kalamazoo
He [G]don’t give no [C]“yes, [C#]I [D]do”
First [G]to the left and then to the [F]right
This [G]old mill grinds [D]day and [G]night
{end_of_verse}
