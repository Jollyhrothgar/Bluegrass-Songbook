{start_of_verse}
She would sit by her window and gaze out
Down the road where her children had gone
One by one they left seeking their fortune
And left their old mother alone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Sometime late at night she would call me
Sir did I here a knock at the door
I would say it was only the wind man
Just as I had told her before
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
It’s only the wind
Your children are not at the door
It’s only the wind
The wind restless wind nothing more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Sometime she would talk of her children
Of her son and her daughter so fair
She said they were much like the wild wind
They sometime neglected to care
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
One night I heard somebody knocking
But I saw as I went to the door
She was there in her chair by the window
Her eyes closesd in rest forever more
{end_of_verse}
