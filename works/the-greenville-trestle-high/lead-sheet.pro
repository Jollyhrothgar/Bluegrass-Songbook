{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I remember as a boy how in [F]wonderment and [C]joy
I'd watch the trains as they'd go [G7]by
And the [C]whistle's lonesome sound you could hear [F]from miles [C]around
As they rolled across that [G7]Greenville Trestle [C]high
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But the [F]whistles don't sound like they used [C]to
Lately not many trains go [G7]by
Hard [C]times across the land mean no [F]work for a railroad [C]man
And the Greenville Trestle now [G7]don't seem so [C]high
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
On the riverbank I'd stand with a [F]cane pole in my [C]hand
And watch the freight trains up against the [G7]sky
With the [C]black smoke trailing back as they [F]moved along the [C]track
That runs across that [G7]Greenville Trestle [C]high
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But the [F]whistles don't sound like they used [C]to
Lately not many trains go [G7]by
Hard [C]times across the land mean no [F]work for a railroad [C]man
And the Greenville Trestle now [G7]don't seem so [C]high
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
When the lonesome whistles whined I'd [F]get rambling on my [C]mind
Lord I wish they still sounded that [G7]way
As I [C]turned to head for home Lord [F]she'd rumble low and [C]long
Toward the sunset at [G7]the close of [C]day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But the [F]whistles don't sound like they used [C]to
