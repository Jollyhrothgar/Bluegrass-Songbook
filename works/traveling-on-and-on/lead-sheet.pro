{start_of_verse}
Oh I was lost in the darkness and I wandered astray
With no one to help me along on my way
Until I heard Jesus calling saying come unto me
And I’m traveling on and on
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Oh Lord I’m traveling on by the help of my Savior
I can never more stray for Jesus leads the way
And my  heaven lies awaiting at the end of my journey (my journey)
Oh Lord I’m traveling on and on
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
Oh I can hear Jesus calling and his voice sounds so sweet
And I knew that the time would come to me that he’d speak
But these trials are over for he bid me come home
Now I’m traveling on and on
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Oh the Lord is my savior I will walk with him each day
He will help and protect me to the end of the way
My journey soon will be over and I’ll join a happy band
Now I’m traveling on and on
{end_of_verse}
