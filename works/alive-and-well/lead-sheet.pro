{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I wish my love for you could die the way that your love did for [F]me
[G7]I wish that I could lay to rest the memory of how good it used to [C]be

[Fm]Instead I lay here every [C]night

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G7]And oh my love for you is still [F]alive and [G7]well
[F]And in the best [C]of health although it's been through [G7]hell
[C]Since you left it hasn't shown one sign of [F]giving [G7]up
[F]It still won't let me [C]love
[G7]Nobody else my love for you is still alive and [C]well

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]I didn't know that love could ever live this long all my itself
[G7]And keep on feeling just as strong as it was feeling on the day you [C]left
[Gm]In this cold and lonely bed the [C]memories should die just from the [F]chill
[Fm]But it stays warm inside my [C]heart
