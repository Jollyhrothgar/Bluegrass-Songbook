{start_of_chorus}
Go now don’t wait
Please don’t hesitate
Lovin’ you was my great sin
And I might take you back again
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
For a long time the world stood still
I loved you then and I always will
But to me you’ve been untrue
There is nothing I can do
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Well here you are you’re back again
I know that I just can’t win
You broke my heart most every day
And now you best be on you’re way
{end_of_verse}
