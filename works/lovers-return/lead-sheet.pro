{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
And [G]so you have come back [D]to me
And say the old love’s growing [G]yet
You’ve [G]tried through all [C]these [G]weary years
You’ve [D]tried so vainly [G]to forget
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Oh, no, I cannot take [D]your hand
God never gives us back our [G]youth
The loving heart you [C]slighted [G]then
Was [D]yours, my friend, in [G]perfect truth
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Farewell, farewell now we must part
You never meant to do me wrong
God sent this anguish to my heart
To teach me to be brave and strong
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Farewell, [G]I think I love [D]you yet
As friend to friend, God bless [G]you, dear
And guide you through these [C]weary [G]years
To where the skies are [D]always [G]clear
{end_of_verse}
