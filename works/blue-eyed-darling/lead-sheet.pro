{start_of_verse}
The days have passed by so slowly
Since you’ve gone and left me blue
If ever you decide to roam dear
Remember I’m waiting just for you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Won’t you be my blue eyed darlin
Won’t you come back home to me
Don’t tell me that you’ve found another
Darling please don’t set me free
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
At night as I lay down to sleep dear
The tears are flowing down my cheeks
Because you left me such a memory
And now I’m all alone you see
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Someday you’ll come and I’ll be gone dear
Somewhere to start my life anew
But if you never do return dear
Remember I’ve waited just for you
{end_of_verse}
