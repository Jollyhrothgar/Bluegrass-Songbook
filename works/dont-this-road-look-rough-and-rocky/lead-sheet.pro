{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Darling, [G]I [C]have come [G]to tell you
Though [G]it almost breaks [D7]my heart
But [G]before [C]the [G]morning darling
We’ll [D7]be many [G]miles apart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Don’t [C]this road look rough [G]and rocky
Don’t [G]that sea look wide [D7]and deep
Don’t [G]my [C]baby look [G]the sweetest
When [D7]she’s in my [G]arms asleep
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Can’t [G]you hear [C]the night [G]birds crying
Far [G]across the deep [D7]blue sea
While [G]of [C]others you [G]are thinking
Won’t [D7]you sometimes think [G]of me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
One [G]more kiss [C]before [G]I leave you
One [G]more kiss before [D7]we part
You [G]have caused [C]me lots [G]of trouble
Darling [D7]you have broke [G]my heart
{end_of_verse}
