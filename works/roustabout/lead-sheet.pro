{start_of_verse}
The fog is rolling out from Memphis
Dark clouds are hangin’ round your door
It’s a long long way from Mississippi
To the Gulf of Mexico
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Well, I make my home on the Mississippi
I’m a roustabout on a Steamboat line
We hit the deck on a Monday morning
Gonna make the dock on a Saturday night
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
Had me a gal way up in Vicksburg
I tipped my hat every time she passed
Then she ran off with a riverboat gambler
With a black silk suit and a little mustache
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Now when I die there’s just one favor
Don’t bury me down in the cold cold ground
Just wrap me up down by the river
Roll me over and point me south
{end_of_verse}
