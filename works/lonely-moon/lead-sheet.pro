{start_of_chorus}
Lonely moon lonely moon won’t you shine in this cell
And tell me that she’s doing well
Lonely moon won’t you tell her I want her for mine
But don’t push her she has her own mind.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
As we gaze and admire the same shining stars
Though our distances are far
We can both watch the moon go down o’er the land
As if we were hand in hand.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Souls can be together while bodies are alone
Love can melt bars and climb walls of stone
We can both watch the moon go down o’er the land
As if we were hand in hand.
{end_of_verse}
