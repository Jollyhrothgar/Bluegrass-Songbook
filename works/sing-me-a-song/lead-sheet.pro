{start_of_chorus}
Sing me a song
Sing me a song
When I come to the end of my journey
I know it won’t be long
Til I cross death’s silent river
Don’t cry just sing me a song
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
As I travel through this life
With its struggle and its strife
Though the days may be weary and long
As I search for happiness I find peace and rest
When I sit down and sing me a song
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Though our burdens are not light
Always fighting for the right
Everything seems to always go wrong
We could find peace of mind if together we could find
Time to sit down and sing just one song
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
When I reach the other shore
Meet loved ones once more
Join in the happy angel throne
If I could forever sing let the hallelujahs ring
I’d be singing a hallelujah song
{end_of_verse}
