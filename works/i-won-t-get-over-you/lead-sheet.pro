{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]When you told [G7]me good[C]bye you [G7]said don’t you cry
You whispered you’ll get over [C]me
But you’ve been gone [G7]for so [C]long
And the [G7]heartaches linger on
And my heart is still full of mise[C]ry
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And I cry [G7]every[C]day but your [G7]memory is in the way
I’ve tried and I’ve tried to not be [C]blue
But alone [G7]in my [C]room there’s [G7]darkness and gloom
And I know that I won’t get over [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I can still [G7]see you [C]yet and [G7]need to forget
All the good things you ever were to [C]me
I can still [G7]hear you [C]say as you [G7]slowly walked away
Don’t cry I know you’ll get over [C]me
{end_of_verse}

And I know that I won’t get over [C]you
{end_of_verse}
