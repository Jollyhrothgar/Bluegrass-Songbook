{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
See [G]that watermelon [C]a’hanging on the [G]fence
How I wish that melon was mine
Some [G]folks are foolish they [C]just don’t have no [G]sense
Or they wouldn’t leave that [D]melon on [G]the vine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Hambone [C]it is [G]sweet chicken it is good
Rabbit [G]is so very very [D]fine
But [G]give me oh give me oh [C]how I wish [G]you would
That watermelon [D]hanging on [G]the vine
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You [G]may talk about your [C]peaches your apples and your [G]pears
Simmons [G]growing on the [D]tree
Folks have their favorites just most every where
But that watermelon is the best for me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I went to get that melon I thought I’d have some fun
The [G]stars they had just begun to [D]shine
But when I heard some moving I left there on the run
But I didn’t leave that [D]melon on the [G]vine
{end_of_verse}
