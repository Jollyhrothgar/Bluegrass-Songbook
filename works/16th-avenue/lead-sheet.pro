{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]From the corners of the country from the [D7]cities and the [G]farms
With [Em]years and years of [C]living tucked up [G]underneath their [D7]arms
They [Em]walked away from [C]everything just to see [G]a dream come [C]true
So God [G]bless the boys who [Em]make the noise on [C]16th [G][D7]Av-enue
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
With a million dollar spirit and an old [D7]flat top [G]guitar
They [Em]drive to town with [C]all they own in a [G]hundred dollar [D7]car
Cause [Em]one time someone [C]told them about a [G]friend of a friend they [C]knew
Who [G]owns you know a [Em]studio on [C]16th [G][D7]Av-enue
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now some are born to money they never [D7]had to say [G]survive
And [Em]others swing a [C]nine pound hammer [G]just to stay [D7]alive
There's [Em]cowboys drunks and [C]Christians mostly [G]white and black and [C]blue
They've [G]all dialed the phone [Em]direct to home from [C]16th [G][D7]Av-enue
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Ah but then one night in some empty room [D7]where no curtains ever [G]hung
Like a [Em]miracle some golden [C]words roll off [G]of someone's [D7]tongue
And [Em]after years of being [C]nothing they're all [G]looking right at [C]you
And [G]there for awhile [Em]they'll go in style on [C]16th [G][D7]Av-enue
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Hey it looks so uneventful so quiet [D7]and [G]discreet
But a [Em]lot of lives were [C]changed there on that [G]little one-way [D7]street
Cause [Em]they walked away from [C]everything just to see [G]a dream come [C]true
So [G]God bless the boys who [Em]make the noise on [C]16th [G][D7]Av-enue
{end_of_verse}
