[C]I'm satisfied with just a [F]cottage [C]below
A little [G7]silver and a little [C]gold
But in that city where the [F]ransomed will [C]shine
I want a [G7]gold one that's silver [C]lined
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C7]I’ve got a [F]mansion just over the [C]hilltop
In that bright [G7]land where we'll never grow [C]old
[C7]And some day [F]yonder we will never more [C]wander
But walk on [G7]streets that are purest [C]gold
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Don't think me poor or deserted or [F]lonely
I'm not [G7]discouraged I’m heaven [C]bound
I'm but a pilgrim in [F]search of the [C]city
I want a [G7]mansion a harp and a [C]crown
{end_of_verse}
