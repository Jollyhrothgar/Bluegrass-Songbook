{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
For fear the [D]hearts of men [D]are failing,
For these are [G]latter days [D]we know
The Great [D]Depression now is [D]spreading,
God’s word [A]declared it would [D]be so
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
I’m going [D]where there’s no [D]depression,
To the lovely [G]land that’s free [D]from care
I’ll leave this [D]world of toil [D]and trouble,
My home’s in [A]Heaven, I’m [D]going there
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
In that bright [D]land, there’ll be [D]no hunger,
No orphan [G]children crying [D]for bread,
No weeping [D]widows, toil or [D]struggle,
No shrouds, no [A]coffins, and [D]no death
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
This dark [D]hour of [D]midnight nearing
And [G]tribulation time [D]will come
The storms will [D]hurl in [D]midnight fear
And sweep lost [A]millions to [D]their doom
{end_of_verse}
