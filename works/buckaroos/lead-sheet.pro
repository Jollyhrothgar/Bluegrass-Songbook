Playin' the Jacks and the Queens
But we [D7]still got some money to [G7]blow
And the [F]times ain't wild [C]enough 
We dig our [F]spurs in the make 'em [C]jump
We're ridin' [F]shotgun with the [G7]devil we're the [C]buckaroos

I said now don't let me down cause when I hit this town
I've got to [G7]live my whole life in a [C]day
