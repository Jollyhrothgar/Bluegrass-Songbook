{start_of_verse}
I’ve been up and down and around and ’round and back again
I’ve been so many places I can’t remember where or when
And my only boss is the clock on the wall and my only friend
Never really was a friend at all
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Well I traded love for pennies and sold my soul for less
Lost my ideals in that long tunnel of time
And I turned inside out and ’round about and back again
Found myself right back where I started again.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Once I had myself a million now I’ve only got a dime
The difference don’t seem quite as bad today
With a nickle or million I was searchin’ all the time
For something that I’ve never lost or left behind.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
And now I’m in my second circle and I’m headin’ for the top
I’ve learned a lot of things along the way
I’ll be careful while I’m climbing ’cause it hurts alot to drop
When you’re down nobody gives a damn anyway.
