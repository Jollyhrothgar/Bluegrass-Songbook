[G]Love sure is [C]something no [Am]one can [G]explain
It can bring you such [C]joy it can [F]bring you [G]pain
And with every [C]emotion [G]love puts us through
There's [Em]nothing you can [A7]say when [F]love finds [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Love is the [C]power that [Am]makes your heart [G]beat
It can make you move [C]mountains make you [F]drop to your [G]knees
When it finally [C]hits you you won't [G]know what to do
There's [Em]nothing you can [A7]say when [F]love finds [G]you

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Give it [D7]all you can [F#m]give it when your [G]love comes [Em]around
If you [D7]put your heart [F#m]in it then it [G]won't let you [Em]down
[C]You'll find out it's [G]true baby [C]someday when [G]love finds you [C]
{end_of_verse}

And when [G]you least [C]expect it it will [G]finally come true
There's [Em]nothing you can [A7]say when [F]love finds [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Give it [D7]all you can [F#m]give it when your [G]love comes [Em]around
If you [D7]put your heart [F#m]in it then it [G]won't let you [Em]down
[C]You'll find out it's [G]true I [C]promise you it’s [G]true
Maybe [C]someday when [G]love finds you [Em]
You’ll [C]find out it’s [G]true      
And [C]someday when [G]love [D7]finds [G]you
{end_of_verse}
