{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I see the town where we were [C7]born 
I [F]see the place we were [C]raised
I see all the [G7]things you [Am]wanted  [D7]that I never [G7]gave
[C]I see sadness I see [C7]sorrow I [F]see pain on your [C]face
But I just can't see a [G7]stranger in my [C][F]pla-ce
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I can see now where we [C7]quarreled
I [F]can see now I was [C]wrong
I can see [G7]where you might [Am]weaken  when [D7]I wasn't [G7]strong
[C]I see memories of a love [C7]gone bad that [F]time cannot [C]erase
But I just can't see a [G7]stranger in my [C][F]pla-ce
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G7]No one seems to know you quite like [F]I  [C]do
[G7]No one knows the things that make you [C]cry
[G7]Looking back it seems I never [Am]showed [F]you
[D7]And now I lie alone and wonder [G7]why
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]I can see now where you might grow [C7]tired
Of [F]dreams that don't come [C]true
I can see where [G7]I have fallen [Am]short 
[D7]Of the things I promised [G7]you
[C]I can see now through my tear filled [C7]eyes
[F]No love on your [C]face
But I just can't see a [G7]stranger in my [C][F]pla-ce
{end_of_verse}
