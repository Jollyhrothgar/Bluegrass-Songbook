That she can go I set [G7]her free
For I don't want to say [C]goodbye 
And [G7]let her see me [C]cry
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Tell to her just any old thing
Say I went somewhere [G7]to stay
For I just can't look her in [C]the eyes 
And [G7]let her see me [C]cry
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G7]I don't want to see or talk to anyone I [C]know 
[D7]Until she's gone until she [G7]goes

[G7]Want you to tell a lie
[C]And just for me say goodbye 
And [G7]don't let her see me [C]cry
