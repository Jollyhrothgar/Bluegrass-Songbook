{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]To ease the pain that heartaches bring from broken love [G7]affairs
To many make the same mistake and [F]try to drown their [C]cares
The liquor flows their money goes and [C7]teardrops fall like [F]rain
One thing for sure this [C]is no cure it’s [G7]just to ease the [C]pain
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
A crowed place a friendly face of one who wears a [G7]smile
The warmth and bliss from someone’s kiss [F]will linger for a [C]while
A drink or two with someone new [C7]might not be in [F]vain
But this won’t heal a [C]hurt that’s real it’s [G7]just to ease the [C]pain  
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
A broken heart will fall apart when left alone to [G7]grieve
To ease the pain and hide the shame [F]you’ll live in make [C]believe 
The tears you’ll hide but deep inside the [C7]torture will [F]remain
There’s no mistake the [C]drink you take it’s [G7]just to ease the [C]pain 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
In every life where pain and strife can hold the winning [G7]hand
The soul will cry and wonder why the [F]things that fate had [C]planned
The doubts and fears and bitter tears [C7]may be an endless [F]chain
But living fast won’t [C]hide the past it’s [G7]just to ease the [C]pain
{end_of_verse}
