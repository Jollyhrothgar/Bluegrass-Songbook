{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
It’s [A]a lesson [D]too late for [A]the [A]learnin’
Made of [A]sand, [E]   made [A]of [A]sand
In [A]the wnk of [D]an eye [A]my soul is [A]turning
In your [A]hand, [E]   in [A]your [A]hand.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Are [E]you [E]going away with [D]no word of [A]farewell[A]
Will there [D]be not [A]a trace left [E]behind?[E]
I [A]could have loved you [D]better, [A]didn’t mean to [A]be unkind
You [E]know that was [E]the last thing on [A]my [A]mind.[A][A]
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus}
As we [A]walk along [D]my thoughts [A]are [A]tumbling
Round [A]and [E]round,  round [A]and [A]round.
Underneath [A]our [D]feet a [A]subway’s [A]rumbling
Underground, [A] [E]  [A]underground.[A]
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus}
You’ve [A]got [D]reasons aplenty [A]for [A]going
This [A]I [E]know,   [A]this I [A]know
For [A]the weeds [D]have been [A]steadily [A]growing
Please [A]don’t [E]go,   please [A]don’t [A]go
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus}
As I lie in my bed in the morning
Without you, without you
Every song in my head dies a-borning
Without you, without you
