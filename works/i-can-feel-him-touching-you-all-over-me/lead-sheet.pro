The last time that he held you

Your feelings I'm not [D7]blind

[G]When I hold you in my arms
A part of you is gone
[C]Something's missing somewhere
I can't put my fingers [D7]on

I can [G]feel him [C]touching [D7]you all over [G]me

You [C]keep saying that you [D7]love me
I keep [G]trying to be[C]lieve
I can [G]feel him [C]touching [D7]you all over [G]me
