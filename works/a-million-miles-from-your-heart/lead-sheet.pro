{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]You’re in my [A7]arms it’s true my [D7]darling
And we’re [G7]one little kiss [C]apart
But I know [A7]just as well as you [D7]dear
That I’m a [G7]million miles from your [C]heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I won’t [G7]pretend I’ll ever [D7]reach [G7]it
I guess I [D7]knew that from the [G7]start
[C]You’ll never [A7]know how much it hurts [D7]me
To be a [G7]million miles from your [C]heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I always [A7]thought I knew a lot [D7]dear
But I guess [G7]that I’m not so [C]smart
Cause if I [A7]knew which road to [D7]travel
I’d walk a [G7]million miles to your [C]heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
It isn’t [G7]fair for just [D7]a [G7]memory
To go on [D7]keeping us [G7]apart
[C]Cause though you [A7]close your arms around [D7]me
I’m still [G7]million miles from your [C]heart
{end_of_verse}
