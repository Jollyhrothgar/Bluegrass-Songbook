{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I hate to [C]see the sun sink [F]low
Just for a [C]cause you ought to [G]know
For it’s true [C]love I can’t [F]forget
All of my [C]sorrow [G]you’ll soon [C]regret
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You promised me love that was true
And I’m sorry to say that I believed in you
It’s all turned out just like a dream
Left me so sad in the world it seems
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
There’s dishes to wash and a house to clean
There’s washing to do, oh it seems so mean
There’s a million words I can’t explain
Think of this girl, before you change your name
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
They’ll go away and leave you at home
They never care if you’re alone
They seem to forget they’ve got a wife
This story is sad, but it’s a true life
{end_of_verse}
