{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I walked in the front door turned the light on [F]in the [C]hall
Then I saw the post-it notes that she had stuck up on the wall
The [F]first one said I love you [G7]but I can't live on love [C]alone
The Little yellow post-it-notes were stuck up [F]every[C]where
One was on the microwave and [F]one on the Frigi[C]daire
[F]It said I cried all night
But you weren't there to watch the teardrops [C]fall
But if [G7]you couldn't get the picture
Maybe [F]you can read the [G7]writing on the [C]wall
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]Sometimes you do what you've gotta do if you do anything at [C]all 
[G7]Sometimes it takes a freight train coming 
Sometimes it takes a mountain to [C]fall
[F]Sometimes you do what you've gotta do
Sometimes you gotta walk before you [C]crawl
But if [G7]you couldn't get the picture
Maybe [F]you can read the [G7]writing on the [C]wall
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The post-it note on her pillow said the [F]lonely nights were [C]hell
The one on the mirror said take a good look at yourself
And the [F]ones you put on the closet door 
Said I waited long enough for you to [C]call
But if [G7]you couldn't get the picture
Maybe [F]you can read the [G7]writing on the [C]wall
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[F]Sometimes you do what you've gotta do if you do anything at [C]all
But if [G7]you couldn't get the picture
Maybe [F]you can read the [G7]writing on the [C]wall
But if [G7]you couldn't get the picture
Maybe y[F]ou can read the [G7]writing on the [C]wall
