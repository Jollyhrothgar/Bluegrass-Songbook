{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I [D]know there is a land of [G]beautiful flowers
Where we’ll [D]meet again when life is [A]over
Where we’ll [D]while away the [G]endless hours
On [D]heaven’s [A]bright [D]eternal shore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
The prettiest [G]beds of flowers will [D]be blooming
By the prettiest treats our eyes will ever [A]behold
Where the beautiful [D]tree of life for us [G]is waiting
By the prettiest [D]mansion [A]made with [D]purest gold
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I want to meet you by that beautiful river
On that eternal morning in the sky
Where we’ll live in peace through endless ages
Where we’ll never say goodbye
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
The prettiest [G]robes and crowns we’ll all [D]be wearing
In the city four square beyond this world of [A]strife
And the [D]prettiest songs of the angels will [G]be singing
On the beautiful [D]morning [A]by the river [D]of life
{end_of_chorus}
