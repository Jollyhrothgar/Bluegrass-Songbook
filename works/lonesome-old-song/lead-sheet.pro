{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I set here in [G]shame while the records are [D]playing
The blues hang around [A]me no need to go [D]home[D7]
I keep on a [G]drinking and wondering about [D]her
That lonesome old song [A]reminds me she’s [D]gone[D7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
That lonesome old song [G]keeps on a [D]playing
And telling a [A]story that makes me so [D]blue[D7]
How the girl that I [G]love has gone on and left [D]me
That lonesome old song [A]reminds me of [D]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I know I’m a [G]fool to still care about [D]her
She’s been [A]unfaithful unkind and [D]untrue[D7]
But all that she’s done [G]right now don’t [D]matter
That [A]lonesome old song [D]reminds [D7]me we’re thru
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I know some day [G]I’ll get over [D]losing
She’s the only [A]girl I could ever call [D]mine[D7]
Since she’s gone away [G]my life ain’t worth [D]living
For a lonesome old song [A]and a bottle of [D]wine[D7]
{end_of_verse}
