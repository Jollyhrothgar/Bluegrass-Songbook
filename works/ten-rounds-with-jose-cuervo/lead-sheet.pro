{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I walked in and the [F]band just started
The [C]singer couldn't care a [G7]tune in a bucket
Was on a [C]mission to drown her [F]memory but
I [C]thought no way with [G7]all this ruckus
But after [C]one round with [F]Jose Cuervo
I [C]caught my boots tappin' [G7]along with the beat
And after [C]two rounds with [F]Jose Cuervo
The [C]band was soundin' pretty darn [G7]good to [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Then some stranger [F]asked me to dance
And I [C]reviled to her my [G7]two left feet
Said [C]don't get me wrong I'm [F]glad you asked
But [C]tonight's about me and an [G7]old memory
Then after [C]three rounds with [F]Jose Cuervo
[C]I let her lead me [G7]out on the floor
And after [C]four rounds with [F]Jose Cuervo
I was [C]showin' off moves never [G7]seen be[C]fore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well [Am]round five or [F]round six [C]I forgot what I [G7]came to forget 
After [Am]round seven [F]or was it eight 
[G7]I bought a round for the whole dang place
And after [C]nine rounds with [F]Jose Cuervo
They were [C]countin' me out and I was [G7]about to give in
Then after [C]ten rounds with [F]Jose Cuervo
[C]I lost [G7]count and started countin' [C]again
