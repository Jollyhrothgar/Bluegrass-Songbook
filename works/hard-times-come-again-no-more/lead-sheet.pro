{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Let [D]us pause in life’s pleasures [G]and count the [D]many tears
While we [D]all [A]sup [A7]sorrow [D]with the poor
There’s [D]a song that will linger [G]forever in [D]our ears
Oh, [G]hard [D]times [G]come [A]again [D]no more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
It’s [D]a song a sigh of [G]the [D]weary
Hard [D]times hard [E7]times come [A]again no [A7]more
Many [D]days you have lingered [G]around my [D]cabin door
Oh [G]hard [D]times [G]come [A]again [D]no more
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Though [D]we seek mirth and beauty and music [G]bright and gay
They [D]are frail [A7]forms a-waiting [D]by our door
Though their [D]voices are silent, [G]their pleading seems to say
Oh, [G]hard [D]times [G]come [A]again [D]no more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
It’s [D]a sigh that is wafted across [G]the lowly plains
It’s [D]a wail that [A]is [A7]heard [D]upon the shore
It’s [G]a dirge that is murmured [D]across the lonely grave
Oh [G]hard [D]times [G]come [A]again [D]no more
{end_of_verse}
