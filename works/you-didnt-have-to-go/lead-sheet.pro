{start_of_verse}
You didn’t have to go you knew that I’d be blue
And now you’re far away I don’t know what I’ll do
It won’t be very long there’ll come a day I know
You’ll see that you were wrong you didn’t have to go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
What made you change your mind why did you say goodbye
You left our love behind you left me here to cry
I guess you didn’t know where this would lead me to
There’ll never be a day of sunshine without you
{end_of_verse}
