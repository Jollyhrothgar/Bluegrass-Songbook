[C]Well the children come back to [F]see the old home[C]place

Back [F]when the old homeplace was [C]new

There's an old swimming hole [F]about a half mile [C]away

And I just dug [G7]fishing worms yester[C]day

They can't get on line [F]from my old tele[C]phone

The toys they treasured are [F]stashed in the [C]attic

They used to use [G7]flying their [C]kites
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
There's a battered old can out [F]there by the tool [C]shed
An old can that [G7]they used to [C]kick
They sit on the porch and they [F]stare down the [C]driveway
They just can't see [G7]living like [C]this
