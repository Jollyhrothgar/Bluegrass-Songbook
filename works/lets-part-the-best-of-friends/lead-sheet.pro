{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Each [G]night I dream of you sweet heart
I [G]can’t [D]see why we had [G]to part
But [G]there’s no reason now to stay
For [G]I [D]was only in your way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh [G]how [C]I long to see [G]your face
Tho’ [D]there’s someone in [G]my place
Or [G]just [C]to hear your [G]voice again
Darling [G]why [D]not part the best [G]of friends
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I [G]played the game of love and lost
My [G]broken [D]heart has paid [G]the cost
And [G]now that I am free to go
Somehow [D] sweet heart I miss [G]you so
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
You [G]say that you are happy now
I’ll [G]try [D]to forget the past [G]some how
But [G]if your new love turns you down
Remember [D]me I’m [G]still around
{end_of_verse}
