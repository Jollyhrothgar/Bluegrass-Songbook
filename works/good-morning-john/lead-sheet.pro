{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Good morning John
Ain't it great to see your future shining brighter 
Than the naked light of [G7]day
You made it John
But I confess there was a time or two 
I thought that you might let it slip [C]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I love you John
In the cold and holy darkness 
You were always shinin' brighter than a [G7]star
God bless you John
For the love and joy you've given 
And the livin' inspiration that you [C]are
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
You scared me John
Cause you crossed so many borders 
Into danger with a price upon your [G7]head
They got you John
And it hurt to see so many friends 
Who ran along beside you lyin' [C]dead
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I know you John
There ain't nothing you can't handle out there
Ain't nothing bigger than your [G7]heart
Keep shinin' John
For you owe it to the others 
And the dark and holy wonder that you [C]are
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Hang in there John
It's a rocky road to glory 
But the straightest and the strongest will [G7]survive
Keep smilin' John
We won't make it there tomorrow 
But today let's say we're lucky we're [C]alive
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
I'll see you John
Though the best of good intentions 
Have a way of gettin' scattered by the [G7]wind
I'm leavin' John
You can lose your mind and memory    
But you ain't gonna lose me as your [C]friend
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
[G7]Good morning [C]John 
{end_of_verse}
