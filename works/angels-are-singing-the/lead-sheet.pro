{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Sweetheart [C]I recall the day I [G]first met you
I wonder if you remember the [C]same
We talked of the love we shared for each [G]other
And longed for the day we’d change your [C]sweet name
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Oh, [C]I can still hear your voice in [G]the evening
I see your sweet face your blue eyes so [C]bright
God took you away and left me so [G]lonely
The angels are singing in [C]heaven tonight
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
As [C]the years passed away we cherished [G]each other
No worries or cares to darken our [C]day
From our little home up in the Clinch [G]Mountains
The savior came down and called you [C]one day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I’ll [C]always be true and love you, [G]my darling
But I know you are happy and healthy up [C]there
When God calls me home I’ll meet you in [G]heaven
Please wait for me, darling, I’ll meet you [C]up there
{end_of_verse}
