{start_of_verse}
Well it’s all over town how you been runnin’ round
You stay out every night till two or three
If you leave me here to cry good lord I don’t know why
You ever made those sacred vows with me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Can’t you understand my dear I thought I made it clear
I never thought it would end in one short year
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
Well I try to understand why you love another man
I try to understand but I don’t
We had a life all planned you took another stand
Now I beg you to come back but you won’t
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Just a year ago today you vowed you would stay
You’re empty words still torture my mind
Our love was meant to last you put it in the past
Do you think about the love you left behind
{end_of_verse}
