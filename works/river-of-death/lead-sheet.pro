{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Oh [D]the river of death lies just before me
Can I find [G]a place that I [D]can cross
Or will I [D]be in sin forever
Oh Lord don’t [A]let my soul [D]be lost
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Oh I wanna [D]walk with Christ my savior
For he’s the [G]one that’ll guide [D]me on
All through my [D]life I’ve been a sinner
Now I’m right with [A]God so I’m [D]travelling home
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh I can [D]hear my savior calling
To me his [G]voice sounds sweet [D]and low
For me I [D]hear my loved ones cheering
Oh, praise the [A]Lord I’m ready [D]to go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
My life down [D]here will soon be over
And this old [G]world holds nothing [D]for me
He saved my [D]soul and He made me happy
That beautiful [A]land I’m going [D]to see
{end_of_verse}
