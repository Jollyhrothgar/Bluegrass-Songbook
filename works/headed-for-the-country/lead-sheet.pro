{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Lightly tripping [Em]through the misty dripping [F]morning
[C]Up the stairs to [G7]see if she was [C]home
When I found a note that she'd [G7]wrote with a pen
[F]Attached upon her [C]door and the two weeks stack of daily papers
[A#7]Said goodbye to [F]someone that I [C]love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And it [F]looks as if she's [G7]headed for the [C]country once [F]again
[C]Far from the city sidewalks the [A#7]neons and the [C]rain
[F]Back to the grassy [G7]meadows to run [C]barefoot through the [F]wind
They [C]tell me that she's headed for the [G7]country once [C]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I miss her sermons of [F]seek and ye shall [C]find
Truth is just a [F]bluebird flying [C]blind
And a special prayer for those whose [F]mind should ever [C]flow
One for the weary for the [A#7]sick and the [F]passing of the [C]good
{end_of_verse}
