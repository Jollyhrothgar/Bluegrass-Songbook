Two old maids a-sitting in the sand
Each one wishing that the other was a man

Early to bed and early to rise
And your girl goes out with other guys

Hard [G]luck [G7]poppa standing in the rain
If the [C]world was corn he couldn’t buy grain

His knees knock together but he’s raring to go
Lord [G]Lord got those Brown’s [D7]Ferry Blues.
