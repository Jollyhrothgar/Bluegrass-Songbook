{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I'd rather live a life of lies and [C]fantasy
[G]Than to face the truth and realize you're leaving [D7]me
You [G]built me up so high [G7]my heart can't stand to [C]fall
And [G]life without your [D7]love just isn't life at [G]all
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
So walk out backwards if you must [C]go
But please don't wave [D7]goodbye
Just wave one last [G]hello
The truth won't hurt so much if I can just [C]pretend
So walk out [D7]backwards
And I'll think you're walking [G]in
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well you walked into my heart in search of [C]sympathy
And from that day down [G]to this
You've walked all over [D7]me
And [G]now you're walking [G7]out to love somebody [C]new
[G]But you're not by [D7]yourself
Cause my heart's leaving [G]too
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
So walk out backwards if you must [C]go
But please don't wave [D7]goodbye
Just wave one last [G]hello
The truth won't hurt so much if I can just [C]pretend
So walk out [D7]backwards
And I'll think you're walking [G]in
{end_of_verse}
