{start_of_chorus}
Where [G]will I shelter [C]my sheep [G]tonight
Where is that peaceful [D7]land
Where [G]will I shelter [C]my sheep [G]tonight
Where the beasts [D7]won’t steal [G]my lambs
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
We’ve [C]travelled far [G]shepherd dog and I
Weary sin sick in [D7]sore
Where [G]will I shelter [C]my sheep [G]tonight
I’ll shelter my sheep [D7]at [G]God’s door
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
My [G]soul is weak [C]and [G]thirsty too
As I cross these burning [D7]sands
Where [G]will I shelter [C]my sheep [G]tonight
Where is that peaceful [D7]land
{end_of_verse}
