{start_of_chorus}
When the [C]mountain dew [G]starts falling
And the green green grass begins to [D]grow
That’s [C]when I realize [G]I love you
That’s why I’m [D]on my way [G]back home
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Back [C]to the one I love [G]so dearly
Back to the one that I love [D]so
back [C]to that girl I spent [G]some time with
Back to my [D]little [G]mountain home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I’ve been [C]away from my home for [G]so long dear
And I feel like a stranger in my [D]home
No [C]one will ever [G]realize dear
That I’m just a [D]drifter all [G]alone
{end_of_verse}
