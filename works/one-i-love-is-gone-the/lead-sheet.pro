{start_of_verse}
I don’t know I don’t know where I’ll go or what I’ll do
It makes no difference what I’ll do without you
Oh I love you my darling but I’ll try and let you be
Goodbye, it’s the last you’ll hear of me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Well I found a bluebird high on a mountain side
And the bluebird would sing it’s little song
So I’ll sigh, I’ll cry, I’ll even want to die
For the one I love is gone
{end_of_chorus}
