{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Mommy look old [C]Santa is [G]crying
Just a while ago he was [C]smiling from ear to [G]ear
Until I told him [C]all that I [G]wanted
Was my [C]daddy home for [D7]Christmas this [G]year
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I forced a smile and tried my best to look [D7]jolly
Just the way old Santa should [G]be
For my disguise had com[G7]pletely fooled his [C]mommy
And my [D7]son didn't recognize [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Just one [D7]year ago we were such a happy [G]family
I can [D7]still see that look on his [G]face
As he [D7]opened his presents and [G]candy
Why there was [A7]love all over the [D7]place
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[G]There sitting on my knee is my [D7]whole world
I can't believe that I let him [G]down
He hugged my neck and then he [G7]turned to his [C]mommy
And though they’re [D7]gone I can still hear this [G]sound
