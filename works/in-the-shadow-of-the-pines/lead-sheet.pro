{start_of_verse}
We had wandered in the shadow of the pines
The moon looked down on you and me
And a darkness stole across the summer sky
And a shadow came between my love and me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Oh, darling, come love me as before
Come back to leave me nevermore
At that spot I’m sad and lonely
And the sun no longer shines
Come and meet me in the shadow of the pines
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
Oh, you went away and left me and my tears I could not hide
You went away and not a word was said
While my throbbing heart was breaking underneath its load of pride
And the pine trees sobbed in pity o’er my head
All our future is o’er shadowed by the darkness of despair
And across life’s path the sun no longer shines
Oh, I’d give this whole world gladly once again to meet her there
And reunite in the shadow of the pines
{end_of_verse}
