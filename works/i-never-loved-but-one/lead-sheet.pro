{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Onward [D]to the [A7]eastern skies
With blueing effort kiss [D]the seas
I sigh in place for those blue [A7]eyes
That have hope and love for [D]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
For [G]they obey have stolen [D]away
That [G]heart that truly once [D]was mine
Like some lone bird without a [A7]mate
My weary heart is [D]desolate
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus}
I [G]look around but [D]cannot trace
One [G]welcome word or [D]smiling face
In gazing crowds I am [A7]alone
Because I never loved but [D]one
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Come [D]up closer to [A7]me now
Your chestnut hair’s been touched with [D]snow
But still it is the same dear [A7]face
I loved so well long years [D]ago
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
The [G]same as on that [D]winter night
You [G]bent to me and kissed [D]my brow
Happy hours of trusting [A7]love
Oh well they’re all over [D]now
And [G]I must sail the [D]whitening foam
Till [G]I can see the [D]foreign home
Til I forget that lasting [A7]face
I ne’re can find a resting [D]place
I [G]look around but [D]cannot trace
One [G]welcome word or [D]smiling face
In gazing crowds I am [A7]alone
Because I never loved but [D]one
{end_of_chorus}
