{start_of_verse}
Pretending that I’m always happy
Pretending that I’m always gay when my heart
Inside of me is slowly dying
Every second every minute of the day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Pretending that I do not love you
Pretending I am glad you’re gone
When I know that you have gone away forever
And the pain within my heart goes on and on
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Pretending that I’ll soon forget you
Pretending now is all I do
For I know that you have gone away forever
The game is over I know I’ve lost you
{end_of_verse}
