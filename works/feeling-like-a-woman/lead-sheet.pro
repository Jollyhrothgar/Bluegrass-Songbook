{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]When you put me down the [F]word got around 
[C]And it wasn't long until I found
[F]Every man that came around 
Had one thing on his [C]mind
They looked at me like [F]so much dirt 
Which [C]only added to the hurt
I [D7]never knew the world was so un[G7]kind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]I went to work in a [F]tavern 
[C]The hours were long and the pay was short
And I [F]waited hoping you'd walk through the [E7]door
In [F]just one night I [G7]overheard 
More [C]sly remarks and [F]dirty words
Than [C]I'd ever heard in [G7]my whole life [C]before
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And if I ever needed someone it was [F]then
If not to [C]love me to [F]least have [C]been my [D7]friend [G7]
That's when he [C]came to me and [E7]picked me up 
From [F]where you let me [D7]fall 
And had me [C]right back feeling like a [F]woman 
In [G7]no time at [C]all
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
And when I really needed someone [F]where were you
Who were you [C]holding when my [F]world was [C]falling [D7]through[G7]
He stood [C]beside me when you [E7]left me 
Standing [F]back against the [D7]wall
And had me [C]right back feeling like a [F]woman
I’m [C]right back feeling like a [F]woman [G7]after [C]all [F]  [C]
{end_of_verse}
