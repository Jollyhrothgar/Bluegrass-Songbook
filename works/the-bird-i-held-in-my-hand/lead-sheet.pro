{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
If [Em]you [C]look out your window as [G]the sun’s [D]goin’ down
I’ll [Em]be [C]there by the side of [D]the road
And [Em]I’ll [C]ride you away from the [G]dirty ol’ [D]town
An [Em]ne’er [C]again leave [G]you alone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
For you were the bird that I held in my hand
Til [A]I [E]learned to fly on [A]my own
You’re [A]a [E]garden in [A]this god [D]forsaken land
And [A]the [E]only true love [A]I have known
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The morning was frozen the sky was still dark
When I last laid eyes upon you
I know the ache you have known in your heart
And darling I have felt it too
{end_of_verse}
