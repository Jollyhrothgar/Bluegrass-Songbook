{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I climb the stairs up to my [F]room 
But no [G7]one meets me in my [C]gloom
The silence tells me she is [F]gone 
Just [G7]call me lonesome from now [C]on
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Why must I love the heartless [F]one 
Who'll [G7]never know the harm she's [C]done
Though love is blind I should have [F]known 
Just [G7]call me lonesome from now [C]on
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
These walls will hide me when I [F]cry 
And [G7]hope that heaven lets me [C]die
What good is life when hope is [F]gone 
Just [G7]call me lonesome from now [C]on
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I pray my memories at [F]last 
Will [G7]fade into the distant [C]past
If I must live and love [F]alone 
Just [G7]call me lonesome from now [C]on
{end_of_verse}
