{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
In dreams of you my [A]body [B]trembles
I wake up and [A]call [F#]your name
But you’re [E]not there and I’m so [B]lonely
Without your [E]love [F#]I’ll [B]go insane
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Those [B]memories [A]of you [B]still haunt me
Every night when [A]I [F#]lay down
I’ll [E]always love you [B]little darling
Until the [E]day [F#]they lay [B]me down
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [B]close my eyes [A]and you’re there [B]with me
Your kiss I feel your [A]face [F#]I see
It’s not your [E]lips now that drive me [B]crazy
It’s just your [E]haunting [F#]memory[B]
{end_of_verse}
