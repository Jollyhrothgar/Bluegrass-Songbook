{start_of_verse}
Is it true that you are leavin’
That you’re go-in’ far away
Is it true that you don’t love me
Is there nothin’ you can say
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Is it true that you love another
That you just want to be free
You know I’d never try to hold you
If you no longer love me
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
Is it true the words you told me
Now are told to someone new
While my heart is slowly breakin’
Tell me dar-lin’ is it true
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Is it true you’ll soon forget me
After we have said goodbye
Is it true that you’ll be happy
While I sit alone and cry
{end_of_verse}
