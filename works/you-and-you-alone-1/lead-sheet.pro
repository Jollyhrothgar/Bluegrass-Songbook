And life's a [G7]chain I drag [C]around
When I can't find a ray of [F]hope
To help me [G7]soothe my worried [C]soul
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Only you and you [F]alone
Can turn the [G7]darkest night into [C]dawn

Then I wake up it's just a [F]dream
All that's [G7]left are memo[C]ries
