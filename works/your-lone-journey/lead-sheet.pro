{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
God’s [D/H]given us years [A]of [A/F#]happiness here
Now [D/G]we [D]must [D]part
And [D/H]as the [A]angels come [A/F#]and call for you
The [A]pangs [D]of [D/F#]grief [G]tug [D]at my heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Oh [A]my darling [D/A]my darling
My [A]heart [A/F#]breaks [D/G]as [D]you [D]take
Your lone journey
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh [D/H]the days will be [A]empty the [A/F#]nights so long
Without [D/G]you [D]my [D]love
And as [D/H]God calls for you [A]I’m [A/F#]left alone
But [A]we [D]will [D/F#]meet [G]in [D]heaven above
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Fond [D/H]memories I’ll keep of [A]the [A/F#]happy days
That [D/G]on [D]earth [D]we trod
And [D/H]when I come [A]we will [A/F#]walk hand in hand
As [A]one [D]in [D/F#]heaven [G]in [D]the family of God
{end_of_verse}
