{start_of_verse}
A Sailor’s life is a merry life
He robs young girls of their heart’s delight
Leaving them alone to weep and mourn
They never know when he’ll return
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Of four and twenty all in a row
My true love makes the finest show
He’s proper tall, genteel with all
If I can’t have him I’ll have none at all
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
My father built me a bonny boat
That on the ocean I might float
And every queen ship that we passed by
I’d there inquire for my sailor boy
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
She had not sailed long upon the deep
When a queen ship she chanced to meet
You sailors all please tell me true
Does my sweet William sail among your crew?
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Oh no fair maiden he’s not here
For he’s been drowned we greatly fear
On yon green island as we passed by
There we lost sight upon your sailor boy
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
She wrung her hands, she tore her hair
She was a maid in great despair
Her little boat on the rock she did run
Saying how shall I live now that my William is gone?
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
A sailor’s life is a merry life
He robs young girls of their heart’s delight
Leaving them behind to weep and mourn
They never know when he’ll return
{end_of_verse}
