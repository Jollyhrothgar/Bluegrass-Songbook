{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
My [E]love you lie in the cold cold ground
In a grave not one week [A]old
To [E]kiss once more your cold cold lips
I’d give my weight in [A]gold gold
I’d give my weight in [E]gold
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [E]can’t see clear to leave your side
I never more will [A]roam
I’ll [E]make my bed upon your grave
A pillow from your [A]stone stone
A pillow from your [E]stone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
There [E]is no fire can warm me now
No blanket made of [A]down
The [E]warmth I feel is from your soul
A seeping through the [A]ground ground
A seeping through the [E]ground
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
And I [E]do not want a house of gold
Or a cold dark [A]cave
I’ll [E]make my home in the musty soil
That lies around your [A]grave grave
That lies around your [E]grave
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Well I [E]can’t abide their laughter
It cuts me like a [A]blade
I [E]prefer the night owl call
And the rhythm of my [A]spade spade
The rhythm of my [E]spade
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Soon [E]I’ll be at your side
Apart we’ll never [A]be
And [E]I won’t hear those above
That make a fool of [A]me me
That make a fool of [E]me
{end_of_verse}
