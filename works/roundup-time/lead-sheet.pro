{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]When it's roundup time on the [F]Chisholm Trail 
We'll be [G7]gathering the doggies [C]in
We'll all be [D7]swapping tales about our [C]summer [A7]trails 
And drinkin' [D7]coffee with all our [G7]friends
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And when the [C]coyote sings no one will [F]hear a thing 
We'll be [G7]gettin' some shut eye [Am]fast
Cause when the [Dm]morning comes there's [C]more work to be [A7]done 
Oh it's [D7]roundup [G7]time at [C]last
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Oh there's a thousand head of cows to [F]heel and head
And [G7]ponies to brand and [C]break
We'll ride from [Dm]dawn to dusk our spurs will [C]never [A7]rust 
It's where a [D7]cowboy is at his [G7]best
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Payday [C]soon will come and we'll be [F]on the run 
For a few [G7]days of hard earned [Am]rest
But [Dm]that won't come until the [C]work's all [A7]done 
Oh it's [D7]roundup [G7]time at [C]last
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Oh it's [D7]roundup [G7]time at [C]last
{end_of_verse}
