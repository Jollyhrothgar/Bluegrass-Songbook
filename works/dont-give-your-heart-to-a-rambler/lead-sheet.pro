{start_of_chorus}
Don’t [G]fall in love with me darling I’m a [C]rambler
Although [D]you’re the sweetest sweetheart in [G]this world
It’s [G]all for your sake dear that [C]I’m leaving
Don’t [D]give your heart to a rambler, [G]little girl
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I [G]handed you a line dear [C]and I’m sorry
You’re [D]just a little [G]sweeter that the rest
Believe [G]me when I say I don’t [C]want to hurt you
Or [D]do anything to mar [G]our happiness
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
If [G]I’d never had the blues, little [C]darling
Or [D]the lure of the road, dear on [G]my mind
But [G]I’m bound to hear the whistle [C]of a freight train
And [D]the boxcars as they rattle [G]down the line
{end_of_verse}
