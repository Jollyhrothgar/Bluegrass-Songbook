{start_of_verse}
Lord I have strayed to far from my home
And the ones who are waiting for me there
I long to hear them singing the songs I love so well
Callin’ me back home to Delware
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Oh Delware keeps on callin me
what I wouldn’t do to be there
For I’m weary of the road and I feel so all alone
And I long to be home in Delware
Yes I long to be home in Delware
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
And in the night I dream of the place I call home
And the geese flyin’ high up o’r the lake
And the mournin’ doves callin’ in the evenin’ of the day
But I’m far far away when I awake
{end_of_verse}
