[C]At 3 AM a station wagon pulled into the driveway 747 Baker [G7]Road
As usual I'm listening I'm pretending I been sleepin' 
But I'm countin' off the hours you been [C]gone
I know just what you'll answer in the morning when I ask you
How come your weekly [C7]feeding took so [F]long 
You'll say you know [G7]Shirley Watkins how she enjoys talking
It just took that long to get our business [C]done

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I thought your [F]garden club was meeting in the grade school cafeteria
With smacked folks at Jerry's Bar and [G7]Grill

Left there by the Green Dimanche [C]spill

Now it's not that I don't trust you cause I'm trying to believe you
But my imagination's runnin' [G7]wild
I see all sorts of people in all kinds of situations
Lately that seems to be the [C]style
I hope you're at your at your meeting just like you've always told me
If not you're gonna [C7]give yourself a [F]thrill
I'll be [G7]sittin' in the shadows at a table in the corner
This Thursday night at Jerry's Bar and [C]Grill
