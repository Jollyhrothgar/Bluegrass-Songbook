{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]You told her lies as her starry eyes looked up in [D7]admiration 
You painted schemes and lovely dreams with all your [G]temptation
You spoke of things like wedding rings and promised her the [C]world
For no [D7]cause at all you let her fall and now she's yesterday's [G]girl
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You think it's smart to lure the heart of a girl whose lips you [D7]kissed
Is it just a game to add her name to your broken hearted [G]list
You've loved some long you've loved some wrong you promised each the [C]world
Each [D7]came to be just a memory and another yesterday's [G]girl
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Don't you sometimes feel that love is real the greatest thing in [D7]life
Not one romance you gave the chance to be your cherished [G]wife
You cheat and lie you make them cry and promise each the [C]world
And [D7]one by one they each become another yesterday's [G]girl
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
When autumn falls and you recall the things that might have [D7]been
Then you'll pause and see you caused the grief that's deep [G]within
When you're old and love grows cold I'll bet you'd give the [C]world
To [D7]just relive and take and give the love of a yesterday's [G]girl
{end_of_verse}
