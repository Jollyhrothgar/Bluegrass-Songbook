{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]You say I've lost you to a woman half my age
A [D7]lovely young acquaintance that you've [G]made
You say your love for me [G7]you've laid [C]aside
And [G]she's rekindled [D7]flames you thought had [G]died
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]But if your love affair with her goes [G]wrong 
And [A7]if you miss the love you left at [D7]home
[G]Come back and we'll tear out this [G7]tarnished [C]page
And [G]we'll forget that [D7]woman half my [G]age
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The lines that time has etched upon my brow
A [D7]face grown too familiar to you [G]now
The look that often took the place [G7]of [C]words 
[G]You're replacing [D7]now with looks from [G]her
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]But if your love affair with her goes [G]wrong 
And [A7]if you miss the love you left at [D7]home
[G]Come back and we'll tear out this [G7]tarnished [C]page
And [G]we'll forget that [D7]woman half my [G]age
{end_of_verse}
