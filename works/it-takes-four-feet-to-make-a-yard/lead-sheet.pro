[G]Billy hand the shovel to me

As [G]soon as we get momma's rose
Just like she wanted them then 
We [C]can get your football out and play
Until your momma calls us in 
[G]There I go again I'm talking to [D7]him
Just like he's still here with [G]me
{end_of_verse}

Oh Lord it's [C]hard  remembering is [G]hard
How he chased the ball I kicked it to
The street underneath the speeding [D7]car
Oh Lord it's [C]hard  without him it's [G]hard
Don't know why I bother keeping up
This [D7]place it takes four feet to make a [G]yard
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Honey bring your basket out
I picked some roses for your crystal [C]vase
Should I [G]mix them up or make them all

And fix your [D7]face

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Cause the [G]people from the garden magazine
Will be here any minute [C]taking pictures 
Of our house and yard and all the flowers in it

Just like she's still here with [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Oh Lord it's [C]hard  the memories are [G]hard
How she blamed me for our Billy's death
And left me cursing me with every [D7]breath
Oh Lord it's [C]hard  without them it's [G]hard
Don't know why I bother keeping up this [D7]place
It takes four feet to make a [G]yard
{end_of_verse}
