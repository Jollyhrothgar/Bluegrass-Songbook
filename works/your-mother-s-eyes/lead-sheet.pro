{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]There you stand in front of me a perfect stranger
Yet it seems as though I’ve known you all my [Dm]life
I [G7]remember years ago there was another 
I [Dm]remember how I [G7]lost her with a [C]lie
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Then I heard she got married down in Georgia
And she had a baby girl before she [Dm]died
[G7]You don’t even have to tell me who you are
Cause [Dm]you look just like her [G7]memory in my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I can see your mother’s eyes each time I look at you
I can hear your mother’s voice each time you [Dm]speak
[G7]When you smile the smile exactly like she used to do
It [Dm]takes me back to [G7]nineteen sixty-[C]three
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Everything you do reminds me of her memory 
It’s as though she’s still just standing by my [Dm]side  
And it’s [G7]hard to hold these feelings deep inside of me
When I [Dm]look at you and [G7]see your mother’s [C]eyes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
You say you’ve got someone who really needs you
Your love for him is showing in your [Dm]eyes
[G7]Please forgive these tears that I’ve been looking through
But it’s [Dm]just like losing [G7]her a second [C]time 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I can see your mother’s eyes each time I look at you
I can hear your mother’s voice each time you [Dm]speak
[G7]When you smile the smile exactly like she used to do
It [Dm]takes me back to [G7]nineteen sixty-[C]three

{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
It’s so hard to hold these feelings deep inside of [G7]me
When I [Dm]look at you and [G7]see your mother’s [C]eyes
