{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]When we're around with other folks
[F]You smile at me you love my jokes
[C]We're such a happy couple you and [G7]I
And [C]when we're walking down the street
[F]You hold my hand you act so sweet
And [C]I don't know if [G7]I should laugh or [C]cry
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
We're only keeping up appearances
[F]Hiding all our loneliness
[C]Fooling everyone but us with [G7]lies
It seems we're [C]tied together more or less
[F]With a strange unhappiness
[C]Keeping up appearances when [G7]we should say [C]goodbye
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
When we're alone no one to see
[F]You never even talk to me
When [C]friends are near you put on quite a [G7]show
And [C]you don't do so bad yourself
[F]At keeping them from finding out
And [C]why we even [G7]bother we don't [C]know
