{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
She bloomed [G]for me in a [C]little village
In a [G]cabin on [D]the hill
We made our [G]vows [G7]to love [C]each other
And I [D7]know we [G]always [G7]will.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
She’s my [C]rose of old [G]Kentucky
I watch her [G]bloom as the years [D]roll by
For me there’ll [G]never [G7]be [C]another
I’ll love her [G]’til [D]the day [G]I die.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
In [G]my dreams I see my [C]darling
In a gingham [G]dress she looks [D]so sweet
How I long for old Kentucky
For my darling I will meet.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well I know you often wonder
And I’ll tell you the reason why
She’s my [C]rose of old [G]Kentucky
And I know that she will never lie.
{end_of_verse}
