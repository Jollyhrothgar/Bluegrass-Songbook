{start_of_verse}
The seasons of the heart can’t last forever
And an autumn chill lies in the summer breeze
My love for you is like a raging river
That even the dead of winter cannot freeze
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Perhaps our pathways will branch around the next bend
And never more I’ll feel your warm embrace
But I’ll hold you close forever in my heart, dear
And in every lover’s eyes I’ll see your face.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
I’ve heard for everything there is a season
And I’ve come to see that winter heralds spring
So if we have to part I’ll try not to regret it
For the love we shared will brighten every thing
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
When my last breath on earth is taken
And all my rivers flow down to the sea
I only hope for me it can be written
That I tried to be the best that I could be
{end_of_verse}
