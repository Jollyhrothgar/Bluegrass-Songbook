{start_of_verse}
I can hear the voice of the boatman comin’
And I’ll be ready when he calls my name
So happy I’ll be on my way to Heaven
I hear the Angels freely say
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Oh the boat of love down at the harbor
It’s waiting there for you and me
I have no fear Christ is the captain
He’ll guide us o’r life’s rollin’ sea
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
Let’s get on board that great excursion
And sail the sea to the home above
Don’t wait too late to make your reservation
It’s the boat of God’s eternal love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Oh the boat of love will soon be sailing
It’s headin’ for that golden shore
Don’t wait too late to make your reservation
Heaven is my home for evermore
{end_of_verse}
