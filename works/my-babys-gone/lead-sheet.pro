{start_of_verse}
Hold back the rushing minutes make the wind lie still
Don’t let the moonlight shine across the lonely hill
Dry all the raindrops and hold back the sun
My world has ended my baby’s gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
The milkman whistles softly as he comes up to my door
The mailman brings the letters by just like he did before
They seem so busy all day long as though there’s nothing wrong
Don’t they know the world has ended? My baby’s gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I wake up sometimes in the night and realize you’re gone
And then I toss upon my bed and wait for day to come
I try to tell my lonely heart it must go on alone
But it cries the world has ended, my baby’s gone
{end_of_verse}
