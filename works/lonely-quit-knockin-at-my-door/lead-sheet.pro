{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Lonely [G]quit [D]knockin’ on [G]my door
Sadness [C]don’t follow me [G]around
You’re [C]always by my [F]side
Watchin’ [G]every tear I’ve cried
Lonely [G]quit [D]knockin’ on [G]my door
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The [G]picture that [D]I’m lookin’ at [G]right now
Is [C]not the one she painted when [G]we met
All I [C]thought I had is [F]gone
And I’m [G]needin’ to move on
But a [G]reason to [D]just hasn’t hit [G]me yet
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
My [G]world blacked out [D]the moment that [G]she left
She [C]slammed the door and didn’t say [G]a word
Add them [C]all up [D]into one
Thunder [C]lightning and big [G]guns
And that’s [G]still the loudest [D]sound I [G]ever heard
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
A [G]man trapped [D]behind a cell [G]room wall
His [C]time’s for life and nothin’ left to [G]fear
He’s [C]under lock [F]and key and [G]he’s just the same as me
But a [G]different kind [D]of sentence put [G]me here
{end_of_verse}
