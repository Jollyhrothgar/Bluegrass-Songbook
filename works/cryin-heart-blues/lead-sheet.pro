{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Crying the blues
I’m [G]crying because I have [D]lost you
Blues I can’t lose
I guess it’s too late now to [G]try
I’ve tried to chose another to love but it’s [D]no use
Crying heart blues there’s nothing that’s left but [G]to cry
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I’ll [D]always remember [G]I love you
My [D]teardrops won’t let me [G]forget
Each [D]tear is a wish to be [G]near you
They [A7]started the day that [D]we met
A trail of [G]tears will lead you to me if you [D]want me
And from my hopeless my crying heart [G]flees
{end_of_verse}
