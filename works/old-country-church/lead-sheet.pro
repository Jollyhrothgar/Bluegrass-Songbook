{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
There’s a [D]place dear to me where [G]I’m longing [D]to be
With my friends at the old country [A7]church
There with [D]mother we went, [D/F#]and [G]our [D]Sundays were spent
With my friends at the old country [A7]church
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Precious years precious years, sweet memory
Oh what [A7]joy they bring [D]to me
How I long once more to [G]be
With my friends at the old country [A7]church
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
As a [D]small country boy, how [G]my heart beat [D]with joy
As I knelt at the old country [A7]church
There [D]with Jesus above in [G]his [D]wonderful love
Saved my soul at the [A7]old [D]country church
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
How I [D]wish that today all [G]the people [D]would pray
As they did at [A7]the old [D]country church
If they’d [D]only confess, [G]Jesus surely [D]would bless
As he did at the [A7]old [D]country church
{end_of_verse}
