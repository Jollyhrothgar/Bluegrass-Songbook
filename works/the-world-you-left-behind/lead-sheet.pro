{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I try to sleep to kill the pain  
When I wake it's still the [C]same
Cause I'm [G]living in this world you left [D7]behind
Just like a broken piece of [G]glass  
You have swept me aside to [C]pass
Leaving [G]shattered dreams with a [D7]lonely heart and [G]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Well here I go again (Here I go [C]again)
It's just like yesterday (Just like [G]yesterday)
The pain is deep [C]within 
My heart to [D7]stay
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G]I'm just a fool to sit and cry
Wasting years before I [C]die
In this lonely [G]world
This [D7]world you left [G]behind
{end_of_verse}

[G]I'm just a fool to sit and cry
Wasting years before I [C]die
