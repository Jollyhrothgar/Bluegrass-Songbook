{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I try to break the habit 
But [G7]somehow I keep waking up [C]alone
And there's something deep inside me 
That [G7]refuses to believe you've really [C]gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And [F]every night I fall asleep 
On [G7]your side of this great big double [C]bed [F]
[C]Remembering that the worst you ever [G7]gave me 
Was the best I ever [C]had
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
How I [F]miss your tender kisses 
And the [G7]gentle arms that used to [C]hold me tight
And the [Dm]gone but not forgotten way we [G7]use to 
Come together in the [C]night
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Yes they [F]say that all good things must end 
But [G7]endings always leave somebody [C]sad[F]
When I [C]remember that the worst you ever [G7]gave me 
Was the best I ever [C]had [G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I'm [C]wondering if you're sleeping like a [G7]kitten 
In somebody else's [C]arms
While I lie awake remembering all the [G7]ways 
We use to keep each other [C]warm
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Oh I [F]know that nothings perfect 
But we [G7]came so close how could it turn out [C]bad [F]
But [C]even so the worst you ever [G7]gave me 
Was the best I ever [C]had
Even so the worst you ever [G7]gave me 
Was the best I ever [C]had
{end_of_verse}
