{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Woke up this mornin' in a terrible mood
Now [F]you talk about a woman treatin' a [C]good man rude
She [F]left me talkin' to myself just a gazin' at that mean old [C]wall
She [G7]had another daddy waitin' down at the end of the [C]hall
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
She changes with the weather like the leaves I recall
She [F]blossoms in the spring but then she's [C]gone in the fall
A [F]two timin' woman with a heart of solid [C]stone
She [G7]tells me that she loves me but her heart's a little under [C]grown
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
She said she'd never leave me but she got that urge to roam
Now she [F]drifts around the country like a [C]stream boat on the foam
Never [F]changes course just travels along that same old [C]way
I [G7]hope she goes a-drift and rolls along back home some[C]day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Now if I ever find her gonna chain her to the floor
Then [F]tell her now sit there woman cause you [C]ain't leavin' no more
I'm [F]gonna tame you woman till you're eatin' from my [C]hand
It [G7]ain't that I don't love you honey it's just to make you under[C]stand
{end_of_verse}
