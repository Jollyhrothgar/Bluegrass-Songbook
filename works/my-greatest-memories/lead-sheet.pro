{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Oh I built so many [F]temporary [C]bridges
That would only hold your [F]love for just a [G7]day
I can [C]see there's nothing [F]I can do to [C]hold you
But there's [F]one thing you can [G7]never take [C]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And you'll go down as my [F]greatest memo[C]ry
Today's the day I always prayed I'd never live to [G7]see
Oh you [C]built me up then [F]tore me down and [C]now you're leaving [F]me
But you'll go [C]down as my [G7]greatest memo[C]ry
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Oh I hope you find some[F]one to paint your [C]rainbow
And all the dreams you [F]pictured in your [G7]mind
Oh I [C]still don't know the [F]reason why you're [C]leaving
But [F]every trace of [G7]you that's left [C]behind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Will go down as my [F]greatest memo[C]ry
Today's the day I always prayed I'd never live to [G7]see
Oh you [C]built me up then [F]tore me down and [C]now you're leaving [F]me
But you'll go [C]down as my [G7]greatest memo[C]ry
[F]Yes you'll go [C]down as my [G7]greatest memo[C]ry 
{end_of_verse}
