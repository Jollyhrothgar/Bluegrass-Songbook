{start_of_verse}
I didn’t know
You’d be in this place tonight
Then again I thought you might
Now I don’t know what to do
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Does it show
When my poor heart skips a beat
Each and every time we meet
‘Cause I’m still in love with you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
There you are
Right across the room from me
Just the way I knew you’d be
Lookin’ lonesome wild and blue
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I’m alright so far
Just as long as you don’t speak
That’s what makes my knees go weak
‘Cause I’m still in love with you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
I’ve done everything I know
To get you off my mind
But sometimes I can’t help but hope
That you won’t walk away this time
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
Then I
Wouldn’t have to watch you go
Wouldn’t have to miss you so
‘Cause I’m still in love with you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
If I knew what I know now
I’d never let you leave
I’d make it up to you somehow
And darlin’ you’d come back to me
{end_of_verse}
