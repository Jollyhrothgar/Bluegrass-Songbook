{start_of_verse}
While you are out beneath the moonlit sky
I sit here and stare at the wall
I think of you sweetheart and days gone by
And I know two more years is all
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Two more years is all and I’ll be free
And then we can start our lives anew
I’ve held your memory so close to me
Two more years and I’ll be free
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
I’ve been in this old prison for nineteen years
It seems like ninety to me
Only twenty-four months of tears sweetheart
Two more years and I’ll be free
{end_of_verse}
