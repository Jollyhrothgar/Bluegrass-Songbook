[C]She's here in the morning when the sun comes up
She's [F]here when the sun goes [C]down
Sweet little woman that makes my world go [G7]round

And her [F]love is my night[C]cap
And there ain't no man can [G7]ask much more than [C]that

Woman [F]pleasin' my [C]woman
Is the one thing that's [D7]always on my [G7]mind

So she will never [G7]ever leave my [C]side
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
She knows when I troubled so when trouble comes
She [F]just doubles up on [C]love
And in her lovin' arms they don't hurt near as [G7]much

Then I [F]start believin' [C]too
There ain't no limit on [G7]what a good woman can [C]do
