{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
There’s an old old house that once was a mansion
On a [G]hill overlooking [A]the town
But time made a wreckage where once there was beauty
And soon the old [A]house had [D]tumbled down.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But when the leaves start to [G]fall [D]in autumn
And the rain starts [G]to drip from [D]the trees
There’s an old old man who walks through the garden
And [G]his head [A]is bowed [D]in memory.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well they say he built [G]that mansion for the love of [D]a woman
And they planned to [G]be married in [A]the fall
But [D]her love [D]faded with the last rose [D]of summer
And the house stood [A]empty after [D]all.
{end_of_verse}
