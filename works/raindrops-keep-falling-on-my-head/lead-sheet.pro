{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Raindrops keep falling on my head
And [C7]just like the guy whose feet are [F]too big for his [Em]bed 
[A7]Nothing seems to fit  those  [Em]raindrops are [A7]falling on my [Dm]head 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
They keep falling  so I just did me [G7]some talking to the [C]sun
And [C7]I said I didn't like the [F]way he got things [Em]done
[A7]Sleeping on the job  those  [Em]raindrops are [A7]falling on my [Dm]head 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
They keep falling  but [G7]there's one thing  I [C]know
The [F]blues they send to meet [G7]me won't defeat [Em]me
It won't be long till [A7]happiness steps [Dm]up to greet [F]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]Raindrops keep falling on my head
But [C7]that doesn't mean my eyes will [F]soon be turning [Em]red
[A7]Crying's not for me  cause  I'm never [Em]gonna stop [A7]the rain by [Dm]complaining
[G7]Because I'm [C]free  [G7]nothings worrying [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
It won't be long till [A7]happiness steps [Dm]up to greet [F]me
[C]Raindrops keep falling on my head
But [C7]that doesn't mean my eyes will [F]soon be turning [Em]red
[A7]Crying's not for me  cause  I'm never [Em]gonna stop [A7]the rain by [Dm]complaining
[G7]Because I'm [C]free  [G7]nothings worrying [C]me
{end_of_verse}
