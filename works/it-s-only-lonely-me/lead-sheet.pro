[G]If you hear some footsteps [C]walking close [G]behind you in the night
And [D7]you look around and no one do you [G]see
If you feel someone is [C]watching you and [G]there's no one in sight
Have no fear [D7]it's only lonely [G]me

It's only lonely me I want you back [C]again
So I'll [D7]send my memory to haunt you now and [G]then
It follows you around wherever you may [C]be
The [D7]ghost of love that's gone it's only lonely [G]me

If sometimes you have the [C]feeling there is [G]something you forgot
Though [D7]you try you can't remember what it [G]was

It was me that [D7]you forgot to [G]love
