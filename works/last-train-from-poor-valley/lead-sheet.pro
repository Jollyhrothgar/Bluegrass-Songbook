{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Well [D]it was good [A]one time [G]everything was [D]mighty fine
The [D]coal tipples [A]roared day [D]and night
But [D]things they [A]got slow for [G]no reason that [D]I know
And ill [D]winds they [A]hove [D]into sight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The [D]mines all closed [A]down [G]everybody [D]laid around
There [D]wasn’t very [A]much that you [D]could do
Except [D]stand in [A]that line to get [G]your ration script [D]on time
And [D]woman I could [A]see it [D]killin’ you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now the [D]soft new snows of [A]December[D]
Lightly [Bm]fall [G]my [D]cabin ’round
So that [D]last train from [G]Poor Valley
Takin’ [D]brown [G]haired [A]Becky [G]Richmond [D]bound
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
It’s [D]been a [A]comin’ on I knew [G]soon you [D]would be gone
Leavin’ [D]crossed your [A]mind [D]every day
Then [D]you said [A]to me things [G]are bad at home [D]you see
I [D]guess I’d [A]better be on [D]my way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I [D]should blame you [A]now [G]but I never could [D]somehow
A [D]miner’s wife you [A]weren’t cut out [D]to be
It [D]wasn’t what you [A]thought just some [G]dreams Lord that [D]you’d bought
When you [D]left your home [A]and ran away [D]with me
{end_of_verse}
