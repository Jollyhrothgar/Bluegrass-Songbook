{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
One [A]evening getting dark, [D]we first met at [A]the park
Sitting [A]by the fountain all [E]alone;
I [A]lifted up my hat, [D]and then began [A]to chat
She [A]said she’d love [E]to see me at [A]her home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Such a star I’ve never seen, she’s as pretty as a queen
She’s as perfect as an angel from [E]above,
If she’ll only be my wife, I’ll live happy all my life
With that [A]aggravating [E]beauty, [A]Lulu Walls
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
If [A]she were only mine, I [D]would build a house [A]so fine
Around [A]it so many fences [E]tall,
It would [A]make me jealous free, [D]that no one else [A]but me
Could [A]gaze on that [E]beauty, [A]Lulu Walls
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
One [A]evening getting late, I [D]met her at [A]the gate
I [A]asked her if she’d wed me in [E]the fall,
She [A]only turned away, [D]and nothing would [A]she say
That [A]aggravating [E]beauty, [A]Lulu Walls
{end_of_verse}
