Just a few chords on the banjo that was [F]all he knew
But in the [C]eyes of a child man his [G7]fingers flew

I will [F]honor my father with these [C]words I write down
And as [F]long as I remember him he'll [C]always be [G7]around

I learned a few [C]chords on the [G7]banjo was the key to [C]life
{end_of_verse}
