{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[D7]You know you [G]won my heart baby right at the start
And [C]I was such a fool for [G]you
I used to believe that you cared for me
By [A7]all the little things you [D7]do
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But [G]I've gotten wise to your disguise
And [C]all of your sweet talk [G]too
So listen to me honey and [Em]hear what I say
Cause [A7]I'm all [D7]through with [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]I should've left my [G]heart at home
When [D7]I went out with [G]you
If [C]I'd been smart baby [G]I would've known
That you'd [A7]take it and break it in [D7]two
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
You know [G]I've got a hunch and I'll bet a bunch
That [C]you'll be kinda lonely [G]too
And you'll sit around and you'll wonder why
I [A7]never come to call on [D7]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
And [G]one of these days baby you'll change your ways
When [C]all of your dreams turn [G]blue
But right now baby you [Em]better believe
That [A7]I'm all [D7]through with [G]you
