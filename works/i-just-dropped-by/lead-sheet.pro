{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G7]I just dropped [C]by [E7]to see the [G7]house [C]I used to [F]live in
I hope that [G7]you don't mind I won't stay very [C]long[C7]   [Dm]   [G7]
[C]So long [E7]ago [G7]someone [C]I lived [F]here together
And then [D7]so suddenly I found myself [G7]alone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]I couldn't [E7]stand the thought[G7]   [C]of living here with[F]out her
And [G7]so I moved away to let my memories [C]die[C7]   [Dm]   [G7]
[C]But [E7]my memories [G7]outlived [C]my better [F]judgement[D7]
This [C]may sound strange to you 
[G7]But I just thought I'd drop [F]by [C]  [G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The very [C]door [G7]you're standing in [C]she used to [F]stand there
And [D7]wait for me to come home every [G7]night
[C]And when [E7]I'd see her standing [G7]there [C]I'd run to [F]meet her
[C]These things were on my mind [G7]so I just thought I'd drop [F]by [C]  [G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I guess that [C]I should leave[E7]   [G7]   some[C]one just might [F]not understand
And [G7]I'm aware of how the neighbors like to [C]pry[C7]   [Dm]   [G7]
[C]But you can [E7]tell them all [G7]today [C]a most [F]unhappy man
Was in the [C]neighborhood [G7]and he just thought he'd [C]drop by
{end_of_verse}
