{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I was born in a Cabin on the [C]Mountain,
[G]60 years ago I left for [D]city life
[G]I moved job to job and soon I [C]prospered
[G]And married Cindy [D]Lou, my faithful [G]Darlin’ wife
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G]Now Cindy Lou is singin’ with the angels,
[C]My sons have wives and children of their [G]own.
[G]Time to pack my clothes, my savings, and my memories,
[G]and retire to that [D]mountain cabin [G]home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
[C]My Mountain cabin home is now a [G]Walmart
[G]There’s condos in the hills I used to [D]roam
[G]There's a apple store, a target, and a [C]costco
[G]But not a Trace of my [D]Mountain Cabin [G]Home
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G]No more hunting, no more fishing, no more logging
[C]Bring your credit card or iphone, no more [G]cash

[G]I pondered in the food court over pizza,
[C]This wasn’t the retirement I [G]planned,

[G]To learn how we were [D]kicked off our [G]land
{end_of_verse}

{chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[G]Two hundred years we lived up the mountain,
[C]Our title to the land was lost in [G]time,

[G]We never saw a [D]dollar or a [G]dime

{end_of_verse}

{chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
[G]Our mountain cabin home was cold and drafty
[C]The winter snow would freeze you to your [G]bones
[G]Now the whole wide world is hot and getting hotter,
[G]Wish I were freezing in our [D]mountain cabin [G]home
{end_of_verse}

{chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
[G]So, I’ll go back to the comforts of the city,
[C]To my power, shower, microwave and [G]phone,
[G]But late at night my mind will go on wandering,
[G]Oh how I miss that [D]old mountain cabin [G]home.
