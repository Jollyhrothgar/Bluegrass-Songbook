{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G7]She only [C]wanted the love [F]that she never [C]had
Just a few of the good times to go with the [G7]bad
While her [C]hungry eyes begged [F]I just didn't [C]see
I was killing the feeling that [G7]she had for [C]me  [G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
When she [C]reached out for me [F]I never was [C]there
And I guess she grew tired of thinking I didn't [G7]care
Now [C]she goes through the motions [F]but she ain't really [C]alive
And I wonder oh how I wonder where [G7]love goes when it [C]dies
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now it's [F]gone that feeling's gone and she [C]can't get it back
She can't love me no matter how hard she [G7]tries
[C]With each passing day [F]her love faded [C]away
And I wonder oh how I wonder where [G7]love goes when it [C]dies
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Now [C]she goes through the motions [F]but she ain't really [C]alive [G7]
And I wonder oh how I wonder where [G7]love goes when it [F]die[C]s
{end_of_verse}
