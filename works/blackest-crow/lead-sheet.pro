{start_of_verse}
As time draws near my dearest dear when you and I must part
How little you know of the grief and woe in my poor aching heart
Each night I suffer for your sake, you’re the girl I love so dear
I wish that I was going with you or you were staying here
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I wish my breast were made of glass wherein you might behold
Upon my heart your name lies wrote in letters made of gold
In letters made of gold my love, believe me when I say
You are the one that I will adore until my dying day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
The blackest crow that ever flew would surely turn to white
If ever I prove false to you bright day will turn to night
Bright day will turn to night my love, the elements will mourn
If ever I prove false to you the seas will rage and burn
And when you’re on some distant shore think of your absent friend
And when the wind blows high and clear a light to me pray send
And when the wind blows high and clear pray send your love to me
That I might know by your hand light how time has gone with thee
{end_of_verse}
