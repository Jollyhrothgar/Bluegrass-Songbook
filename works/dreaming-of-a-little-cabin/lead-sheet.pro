{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]In dreams of yesterday I wander back [C]to my little cabin [G]door
I strolled beside an old rock garden and saw familiar scenes once [D7]more
I [G]heard the organ softly playing [C]its music came so sweet and [G]low
And I heard my mother sweetly singing as oft I did so [D7]long a[G]go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I heard her sing the Rock of Ages [C]and Silver Threads Among the [G]Gold
She told me once again of Jesus within the little cabin [D7]fold
She [G]opened up a faded Bible where [C]the family record used to [G]be
And I knew it was the same sweet mother when years ago had [D7]cradled [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I was dreaming of a little cabin when I [C]heard somebody call my [G]name
I looked and saw a sweet old lady and it seemed I was a child [D7]again
She [G]gently put her arms around me and [C]kissed her little boy once [G]more
And I knew it was the same sweet mother 
That had kissed me many [D7]times be[G]fore
{end_of_verse}
