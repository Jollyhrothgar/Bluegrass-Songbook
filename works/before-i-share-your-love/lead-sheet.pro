{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I learned before we met that love was [G7]blind
And sometimes it leaves a broken heart [C]behind
We loved and lost before and now you [F]know
And [G7]before I share your love[F]  I'll let you [C]go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I'd [F]do most anything to make you [C]happy
But to [F]share your love would drag me down to [G7]low
And I'd [F]rather lose the love we have com[C]pletely
Yes [G7]before I share your love[F]  I'll let you [C]go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
