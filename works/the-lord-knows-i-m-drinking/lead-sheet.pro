{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Hello Mrs. Johnson you self-righteous woman
Sunday School teacher what brings you out [C]slumming
Do you reckon the [G]preacher would [G7]approve where you [C]are
Standing here [G]visiting with a back-sliding [D7]Christian
In a neighborhood [G]bar
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Well yes that's my bottle and yes that's my glass
And I see you're eye balling this pretty young [C]lass
It ain't none of your [G]business but [G7]yes she's with [C]me
And we don't need no [G]sermon you self-righteous [D7]woman
Just let us [G]be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The Lord knows I'm [C]drinking and running [G]around 
And He don't need your [C]loud mouth informing the [D7]town
The Lord knows I'm [C]sinning  and sinning ain't [G]right 
But me and the Good Lord's gonna have us a good [D7]talk
Later [G]tonight

Goodbye Mrs. Johnson you self-righteous biddy
I don't need your preaching and I don't need your [C]pity
So go back to [G]whatever you [G7]hypocrites [C]do
And when I talk to [G]Heaven be nice and I'll put [D7]in 
A good word for [G]you
