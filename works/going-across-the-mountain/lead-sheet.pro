{start_of_chorus}
Going across the mountain
Oh fair ye well
Going across the mountain
Hear my banjo tell
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
Going across the mountain
Join the boys in blue
When this war is over
I’ll come back to you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Got my rations on my back
My powder it is dry
Going across the mountain
Crissie don’t you cry
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Waitin’ ‘fore it’s good daylight
If nothin happens to me
I’ll be way down yonder
In old Tennessee
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
‘Spect you’ll miss me when I’m gone
But I’m going through
When this fightin’s over
I’ll come back to you
{end_of_verse}
