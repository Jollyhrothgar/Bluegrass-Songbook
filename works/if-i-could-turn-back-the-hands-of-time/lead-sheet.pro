{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Well I packed up my old clothes and drove on down the road
Four hunderd miles or more until I reached my next show.
The wind was blowing cold and brother don’t you know
This pain inside my heart just won’t let go.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I never was one to follow a straight and narrow path
But I would now if it would lead me to my past.
Back to her loving arms is where I want to go
To the one who left me out in the cold.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
If I [G]could turn back the [Em]hands of [C]time
To the day when she was mine
If she’d take me back right now
I would walk the line
If I [G]could turn back the [Em]hands of [C]time.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
She never wanted me to leave her all alone
She needed someone there to keep her warm at home
Her words now are so clear in my mind
If I had only read between the lines.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I’ll play another smoke filled bar for tips in a jar
Another lonely night just me and my guitar
But if she would open up her heart to me again
I’d stop running down this road that has no end.
{end_of_verse}
