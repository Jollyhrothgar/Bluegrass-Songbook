{start_of_verse}
He was the blessed father of Abraham
Brought his people to the promised land
Poured milk and honey at their feet
Told them to ask they shall recieve
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Do you know the father son and the holy ghost
The prince of peace and the heavenly host
He delivered us from sin and he’ll come this way again
Do you know the father son and the holy ghost
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
He cured the blind the sick and the deaf
He raised poor Lazarus up from the dead
Turned pure water into wine
And sent his only son to die
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
When you know these miracles to be true
Trust what the Lord has in store for you
Believe me my friend you best get right
Cause this could be the night we all take flight
{end_of_verse}
