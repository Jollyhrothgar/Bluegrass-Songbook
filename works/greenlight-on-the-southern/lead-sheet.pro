{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Standing on the sidetrack at the [A]south end [D]of town
on a hot dry dusty august day the [A]steam pipe pouring down
the [D]fireman with his long oil [A]can oiling the old [D]valve gears
waiting for the semaphore the fast [A]mail train [D]to clear
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The engineer in the old high cab his [A]gold watch in [D]his hand
looking at the waterglass and [A]letting down the sand
rolling [D]out on the old main [A]line taking up [D]the slack
gone today so they say but [A]tomorrow he’ll [D]be back
{end_of_verse}

oh if I [A]could [G]return[D]
to those [G]boyhood days [A]of mine
and the [D]greenlight on the southern southern railroad line
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
creeping down the rusty rails of the [A]weed grown [D]branch line
the section houses gray and white by the [A]yard limit sign
the [D]hoggers call the old high [A]ball no more time [D]to wait
rolling down to birmingham with a [A]10 car load [D]for freight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
the whistle scream with a hiss of steam the [A]headlight [D]gleams clear
the drivers roll on the green and go [A]getting mighty near
handing [D]up the orders to [A]the engine crew [D]on time
it’s the Alabama great southern [A]AGS [D]railroad line
{end_of_verse}
