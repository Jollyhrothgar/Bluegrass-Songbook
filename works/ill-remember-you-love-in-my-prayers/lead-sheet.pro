{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
When [G]the curtains of night are pinned back by the stars
And the beautiful moon sweeps the [C]sky
When [G]the dew drops of heaven are kissing [F]the rose
It [G]is then that [D]my [G]memory flies
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Upon [G]the wings of some beautiful dove
To hasten the message of [C]cheer
I’ll [G]send you a kiss of affection [F]and say
I’ll [G]remember [D]you, Love, in [G]my prayers
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
When [G]the angels of heaven are guarding the good
As God has ordained them to [C]do
In [G]answer to prayers that I offered [F]to Him
I [G]know there’s [D]one waiting [G]for you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Go [G]where you will on land or on sea
I’ll share all your sorrows and [C]cares
And [G]at night when I kneel by my bedside [F]to pray
I’ll [G]remember [D]you, Love, in [G]my prayers
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
May the angels be with you and guard you through life
And guide you up Heaven’s bright stairs
And know that I love you wherever you roam
I’ll [G]remember [D]you, Love, in [G]my prayers
{end_of_verse}
