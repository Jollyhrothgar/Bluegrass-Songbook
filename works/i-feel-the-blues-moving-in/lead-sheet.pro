{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Though the [G]miles are between us, [G]I thought our love would strengthen
As [G]it [D]had, so [G]many times before
But [G]something has happened, I [G]can see it in your writing
I [G]can tell my world is [D]crumbling and the [G]blues are at my door
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
The [G]last letter that you wrote was on [G]a blue piece of paper
That [G]old [D]feelings [G]back, [G]the clouds are moving in
The [G]beginning of the end is near [G]I feel your love is fading
In [C]the darkness, it seems I have [C]no friend
I [C]feel [D]the [G]blues [G]moving in
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh it’s [G]not the words you wrote that left [G]me sad and broken hearted
Or [G]put me [D]in [G]this sad shape I’m in
Between [G]the lines and mixed emotions are the [G]teardrops on the paper
You [G]said that’s all I write [D]you now I’ll [G]close for now old friend
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
My [G]state of mind is desperate as [G]the hole that I’m sinking in
Gets [G]deeper [D]while [G]I’m digging to get out
Oh [G]please give me the right answer to [G]the question I’m asking
Tell me you still love me it would turn my world around
{end_of_verse}
