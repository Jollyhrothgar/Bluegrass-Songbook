[G]This lonely old room is about to get [C]me
Empty [D7]bottles all over the [G]floor
You just don't know how much it upset [C]me
When you [D7]said you didn't love me [G]anymore

[C]Some lonely [D7]times I've had [G]before
Would hang around for a [A7]while but wouldn't [G]stay
But the [C]loneliness [D7]I feel [G]today
Lord I can't even [D7]drink it [G]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I've been known to turn to the [C]bottle
When [D7]my problems seemed to much to [G]bear
But that old friend ain't helping much this [C]time
Since you [D7]said that you no longer [G]care
