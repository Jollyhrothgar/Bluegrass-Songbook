{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Well you [G]said you wouldn’t leave me ’cause you didn’t want to grieve me
And you couldn’t stand to see tears in my [D]eyes
But you said you loved another and it [D]ain’t like he’s your brother
So I guess it’s time for me to [G]realize
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Don’t worry ’bout the mule just load the [D]wagon
I can make it baby and I ain’t [G]bragging
If you think I’m going to cry your feet are [C]draggin’
Don’t worry ’bout the mule just load the [D]wagon
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well I [G]think that I’ll surrender you keep looking out the windows
And it’s plain that you don’t love me any [D]way
All you do is walk and piddle while I’m [D]playing second fiddle
I don’t think that I can stand another [G]day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Don’t worry ’bout the mule just load the [D]wagon
I can make it baby and I ain’t [G]bragging
If you think I’m going to cry your feet are [C]draggin’
Don’t worry ’bout the mule just load the [D]wagon
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
For a [G]long time I’ve been knowin’ in your eyes it’s all been showin’
And I knew some day someone would take [D]my place
These cold kisses you’ve been givin’ and the [D]way that we’ve been livin’
There’s enough to make a man start turning [G]grey
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Don’t worry ’bout the mule just load the [D]wagon
I can make it baby and I ain’t [G]braggin’
If you think I’m going to cry your feet are [C]draggin’
Don’t worry ’bout the mule just load the [D]wagon
{end_of_verse}
