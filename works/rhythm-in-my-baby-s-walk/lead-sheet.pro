{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I've traveled across this country been in every town
[C7]I looked through those catalogs until I finally found
[F]A girl with a study eye the kind that really talks
[G7]I haven't time to make a rhyme of the rhythm that's in my baby's [C]walk
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I've been from California back through Tennessee
[C7]I've searched on nooks and corners you suit me to a tee
[F]The way you carry your little head the little slang you talk
[G7]I haven't time to make a rhyme of the rhythm that's in my baby's [C]walk
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]The twinkle in your pretty eyes thrills me through and [C]through
[F]I had to take a second look to [D7]see if it was [G7]true
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]My roaming days are over I know I'll settle down
[C7]In some secluded rendezvous away out way from town
[F]The love-light tells the answer her eyes began to talk
[G7]I haven't time to make a rhyme of the rhythm that's in my baby's [C]walk
