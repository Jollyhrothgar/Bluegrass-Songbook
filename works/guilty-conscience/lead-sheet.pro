[C]Oh does a guilty conscience [F]make you rule the [C]day
You let another take you from my [G7]side

Or does a guilty [G7]conscience hurt your [C]pride

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G7]Does he take you to the same old [C]places 
Does he kiss you like I used to [G7]do
[C]When you see the old familiar [F]faces 
[C]Does a guilty [G7]conscience bother [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Have you kept my letters and [F]my [C]photograph
Have they faded like the love we [G7]knew
[C]When you read them over does [F]your heart [C]regret
And does a guilty [G7]conscience make you [C]blue
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[G7]When the day is done and night is [C]falling 
And you see that big moon in the [G7]sky
[C]When you lay your head upon your [F]pillow 
Does a guilty [G7]conscience make you [C]cry
{end_of_verse}
