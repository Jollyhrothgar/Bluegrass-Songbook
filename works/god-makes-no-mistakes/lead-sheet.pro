[G]Why I've heard people say [C]why is this tree [G]bent
Why they don't have God enough to know that's the way that it was [D7]meant
[G]Why is this little baby born all [C]twisted and out of [G]shape
[C]We're not to [G]question what He does cause [C]God makes no mis[G]takes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Why I've heard people say [C]why is my child [G]blind
[C]Why is that old [G]drunk still living when a daddy like mine is [D7]dying
Our [G]blessed Father gives us life has the [C]power to take it [G]away
[C]There's a reason for[G] what He does cause[D7] God makes no mi[G]stakes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Why I've heard people say [C]God cannot be [G]alive
And [C]all the things that people [G]say has to be a [D7]lie
When they're [G]down and out and they need a hand 
And their [C]very souls at [G]stake
If they'll [C]call on Him [G]and just believe [D7]God makes no mis[G]takes
{end_of_verse}
