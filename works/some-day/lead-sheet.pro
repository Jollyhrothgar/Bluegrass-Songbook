{start_of_verse}
Some day when my last line is written
Some day when I’ve drawn my last breath
When my last words on earth have been spoken
And my lips are sealed in death
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Don’t look on my cold form in pity
Don’t think of me as one dead
It’ll just be the house I once lived in
My spirit, by then, will have fled
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I’ll have finished my time here allotted
But I won’t be in darkness alone
I will have heard from Heaven
The summons to come on home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
And when my body is in the grave
Don’t think that I’ll be there
I won’t be dead, but living
In the place Jesus went to prepare
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
And after all is said and done
Know that my last earnest prayer
Is that my loved ones be ready
Someday to meet me thereBl
{end_of_verse}
