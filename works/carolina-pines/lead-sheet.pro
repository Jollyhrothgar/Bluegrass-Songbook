{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Just an [G]old house with the roof [C]fallin’ in
Standin’ [G]on the edge of [D]the field
Watching [G]the [G7]crops grow like [C]its always [Cm]done before
Nobody [G]lives [C]here [Em]anymore[D]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The [C]sun’s [D]going down on [G]the [Em]Carolina pines
I’m a long way from home
I miss that love of mine broken windows empty doors
Nobody [G]lives [C]here [Em]anymore[D]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Old memories come whistling like the [C]wind
Through the [G]walls and the cracked [D]window panes
And the [G]grass is [G7]growing [C]high around the [Cm]kitchen door
Nobody [G]lives [C]here [Em]anymore[D]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Once there were children and a [C]few hired hands
A [G]hard working woman and [D]a bone tired man
Now [G]that [G7]old sun [C]steals across a [Cm]dusty floor
Nobody [G]lives [C]here [Em]anymore[D]
{end_of_verse}
