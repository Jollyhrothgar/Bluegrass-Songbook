{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I've never been to heaven and [G7]walked those streets of [C]gold
I haven't seen the [G]pearly gates or heard them call the [D7]roll
I've [G]never heard an angel band or [G7]trumpets when they [C]blew
But I see an angel [G]everyday when [D7]I come home to [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
They [D7]say an angel's body is [C]one thing you can't [G]touch
But [A7]they don't know about the one that [D7]touches me so much
[G]They say angels can't be seen [G7]but I know that's not [C]true
I see an angel [G]everyday when [D7]I come home to [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
An angel's not supposed to wear [G7]cowboy boots and [C]jeans
Or ride around in [G]pickup trucks they fly around with [D7]wings
[G]Someone left the gates to heaven [G7]open wide one [C]day
And I'm the lucky [G]man who found [D7]the one that got [G]away
