{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Just last night my love [G7]said she was [C]leaving
I sat right there and [G7]cried until the [C7][C]dawn
Then [F]booze was added to the pain and [C]heartbreak
The combination equaled [G7]trouble from then [C]on
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Blues plus [F]booze means I [C]lose
Not a [F]right combination for anyone to [C]choose
[F]Nobody knows the feeling till he's been in my [C]shoes
Blues plus [F]booze means I [C]lose 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Tonight I'm fast [G7]forgetting how she left [C]me
But tomorrow pain will [G7]come on twice [C]as [C7]strong
I [F]order stronger booze and louder [C]music
Like I'm happy for [G7]tonight but not for [C]long
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
