{start_of_verse}
The postman came and brought a letter
It was from her boy who went away
She gave him up to join the colors
Each time he writes I hear her pray
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Dear God watch o’er my boy in service
Help him win his victory
And when this cruel war is over
Bring him safely back to me
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
Then came the day they walked together
To the train that took him away
She knew her boy would be a hero
Her smilin eyes just seemed to say
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Now soldier boy don’t e’er forger her
She prays to God for you each day
That harm may never overtake you
While you are fighting far away
{end_of_verse}
