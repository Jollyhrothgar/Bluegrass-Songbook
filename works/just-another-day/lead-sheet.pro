{start_of_verse}
Just another day how can I stand it
Without my baby by my side
This empty feeling now inside me
Is bound to show but I can’t cry
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Just make mine straight without a chaser
And let me drown my blues this way
The seat beside me now is empty
Nothing to live for just another day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
A thief could rob and take my money
If death was pending I could pray
I’m helpless now what can my fate be
Everything is gone just another day
{end_of_verse}
