[C]Not long ago this heart of mine was [F]broken

Then [G7]I met you that's when I knew the wall would [C]fall

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
This [G7]wall is falling from around this [C]heart of mine
I [F]can't resist your tender kiss [G7]that's all divine
To [C]lose you now would be my big [F]downfall
So [G7]please don't make me build another [C]wall
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I'm free now from the prison built by [F]heartbreak
Where [C]memories from your love have kept me [G7]bound
But i[C]n your arms I've found true love and f[F]reedom
I'm [G7]glad you crumbled my wall to the [C]ground
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
The [G7]wall has fallen from around this [C]heart of mine
I [F]can't resist your tender kiss [G7]that's all divine

So [G7]please don't make me build another [C]wall
