{start_of_verse}
All alone down on my luck
I was down to my last buck
I’d do anything for money
Short of stealin’
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
So I get up from my bed
Shake the memories from my head
And look out through the window pane
On Wheeling
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
In this same old room last night
Two loving arms held me so tight
And the words she said
I found myself believing
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Ah but this morning she’s gone
Left me to face the lonely dawn
Gonna bid farewell to that lyin’ gal
In Wheeling
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
That old memory sure looks cold
This old town is covered with snow
And the way I feel Lord
Life ain’t worth living
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I’m gonna cross that big old bridge
Gonna climb that Ohio ridge
Gonna turn my back on this lonesome town
Called Wheeling
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Wheeling Wheeling
Your’e a lonesome town Wheeling
But I’m leaving just like I come
Broke and hungry and on the bum
But I won’t forget the girl I met
In Wheeling
{end_of_verse}
