{start_of_verse}
Now you can take my money and you can take my pride
You can take that long road down the mountain side
Go downtown and fool around but you’re not fooling me
I’m not the one you love so don’t come home to me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
I’m tired of being lied to tired of growing old
Tired of living my life for  love grown cold
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
Now you can catch a wild bird and you can set it free
But you can’t turn loose the pain that’s trapped inside of me
You can teach the cheating kind to live the golden rule
My mama didn’t raise me to be a dog-gone fool
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Now you can take your whiskey and you can take your wine
And I might spend some lonely nights but I’ll just take my time
There comes a time a broken heart just has to close it’s door
Tired of giving part, just can’t give no more
{end_of_verse}
