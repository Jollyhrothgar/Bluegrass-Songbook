Mothers [D]not dead, she’s only a [A]sleeping
Just patiently waiting for Jesus to [D]come
The birds will be singing while Mother is [A]sleeping
They will sing o’er as the grave sinks [D]away[D][G]

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Well [D]I left my old home way back in [A]the mountains
For mother and father had both passed [D]away
We followed our mother up to the [A]graveyard
For mother was called to heaven that [D]day[D][G]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh [D]how we miss her around the old [A]home place
Everything seems so lonesome since she went [D]away
Mother [D]is sleeping way back the [A]mountains
Yes mother is sleeping way back in the [D]hills[G][D]
{end_of_verse}
