Love is a [G]precious [D]thing [G]I’m told

There [G]ain’t no [D]ash [G]will burn

You say this [G]life [D]is not [G]your lot
Well I can’t [G]be [D]something that [G]I’m not

There [G]ain’t no [D]ash [G]will burn
{end_of_verse}

In every [G]life [D]there comes [G]a time

There [G]ain’t no [D]ash [G]will burn
{end_of_verse}

There is [C]one lesson I [G]have learned
There [G]ain’t no [D]ash [G]will burn
