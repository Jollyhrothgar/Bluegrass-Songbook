{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]If you should meet some lonely soul
Who on this [C]earth can't reach his [G]goal
And he's travelin' down the road so dark and [D7]dim
Lend a [G]hand say a prayer
Give a [C]smile that he might [G]share
But for the grace of God it could be [D7]you instead of [G]him
(But for the grace of God it could be [D7]you instead of [G]him)
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Befriend each stranger in the night
Help to [C]make his burdens [G]light
Lift up the fallin' ones and be a [D7]friend
Shed a [G]tear share a sigh
Share his [C]fears don't pass him [G]by
But for the grace of God it could be [D7]you instead of [G]him
(It could be [D7]you instead of [G]him)
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Shed a tear share a sigh
Share his [C]fears don't pass him [G]by
But for the grace of God it could be [D7]you instead of [G]him
(It could be [D7]you instead of [G]him)
