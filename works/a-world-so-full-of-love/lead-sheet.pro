{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I know how it feels to be alive with no desire to live
I know how it feels to never take and [F]always have to give
And the [C]day I found [E7]out was on the day [F]you let me [C]down
In this world so full of love with not [G7]enough to go [C]around
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I was once so proud to have your love that I could burst with pride
But you took that away and now I'm breaking [F]up inside
It's [C]enough to make me [E7]wish that I could hide [F]and not be [C]found
In this world so full of love with not [G7]enough to go [C]around
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
For days and nights I wonder and the reason I can't find
There's so much love around [F]me and no love to call mine
It's [C]enough to make me [E7]wish that I could hide [F]and not be [C]found
In this world so full of love yet not enough [G7]to go [C]around
{end_of_verse}
