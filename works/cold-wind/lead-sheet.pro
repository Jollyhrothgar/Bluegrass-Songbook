{start_of_chorus}
What’s that knockin’ at my door
Hard times (hard times) (hard times)
What’s that blowin’ in my window
Cold wind (cold wind) (cold wind)
Let the cold wind blow and the hard times roll
Ain’t gonna worry no more.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
Now summer’s gone and winter times a’ comin’
And the cold winter winds gonna blow
You should come on home and 1 wouldn’t be alone
Wouldn’t have to worry any more.
{end_of_verse}
