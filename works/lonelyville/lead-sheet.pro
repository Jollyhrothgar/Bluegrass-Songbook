[C]Well I'm moving from the [F]bright lights of the [C]city
To a place where the sun don't shine and it never [G7]will
A [C]town where no one [F]knows the popu[C]lation
I'm moving to a [G7]place called Lonely[C]ville
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The [F]street lights there are black as the bottom of a [C]coal mine
And the faces you see there will make you [G7]chill
The [C]dark and lonely [F]sidewalks of that [C]city
Are waiting now for [G7]me in Lonely[C]ville
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
This town's changed a [F]lot since my love left [C]here
Her love left my world so cold and [G7]still
So [C]I'm moving to a [F]place where no one [C]knows me
A dark and lonely [G7]place called Lonely[C]ville
{end_of_verse}
