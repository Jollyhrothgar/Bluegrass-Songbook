[G]All my life was a paper 
Once plain pure and [C]white 
Till you moved with your [G]pen

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Changing moods now and then
Till the balance was [C]right

Then you added some [G]music 
Every note was in [C]place 
And anybody could [G]see

All the changes in me
By the [C]look on my [D7]face

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
And [G]y-ou  [C]decorated my [G]life 
Created a [C]world  [G]where dreams are a [D7][C]p-art 
And [G]y-ou  [C]decorated my [G]life 
By painting your [C]love  [G]all over my [D7][C]he-art 
You decorated my [G]life

In an unfinished [C]song

Life meant nothing to me
Until you came [C]along 
{end_of_verse}

What a gentle [C]surprise 
Now I'm able to [G]see

All the things life can be
Shining [C]soft in your [D7]eyes 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Then you added some [G]music 
Every note was in [C]place 
And anybody could [G]see 
{end_of_verse}
