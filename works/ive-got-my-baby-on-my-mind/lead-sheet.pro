{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Slowly one by [F]one the memories [C]start
And softly she walks across my [G7]heart
[C]Now I don’t care if [F]it rains or [C]shines
[F]I’ve got my [G7]baby on my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

[F]A telephone call brings me back to [C]earth
[F]But I don’t want to talk to no one  less it’s [G7]her
[C]Someone else would [F]only waste my [C]time
[F]I’ve got my [G7]baby on my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}
