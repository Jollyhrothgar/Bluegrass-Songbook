{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[F]These [C]hands you can hold 'em [F]all night if you [C]want to
And these lips won't mind your [F]kisses no they don't [G7]care
You can [C]lay your head on my [F]shoulder 
Maybe [C]even get a [G7]little [F]bolder
But when it [C]comes to my heart [G7]don't touch me [C]there
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]Oh these [C]arms you can [F]wrap 'em round you [C]gently
And your fingers you can [F]run 'em through my [G7]hair
But there's [C]one place that's off [F]bounds 
From the [C]last time [G7]love came [F]round
When it [C]comes to my heart [G7]don't touch me [C]there
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Last time I gave my heart so sweetly 
It [F]broke he broke it so completely
[C]That even now it's more than I can [G7]bear
Now some[C]day I know I'll try again some[F]day but until then
When it [C]comes to my heart [G7]don't touch me [C]there
