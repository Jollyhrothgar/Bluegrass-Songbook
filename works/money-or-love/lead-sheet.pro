{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]There's every kind of definition
But it's [F]something you can't [C]put your finger [G]on
There's a [C]constant exhibition
You [F]explore the propo[C]sitions then you're [G]gone
It's [A]either money or love that's [F]in your catch
[C]Seldom those two [G]ever match
And then [F]lines will all be [D7]blurred before too [G]long
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Now there is a slight deception
As [F]you look for all the [C]reasons not to [G]run
And [C]without any exception
Every [F]possible [C]exemption can be [G]done
It's [A]either money or love you're [F]digging for
[C]Seldom love is [G]valued more
But [F]only love can [D7]tell you who's the [G]one
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
There is a [C]lot you can do with money sometimes
It seems like a [F]blessing from [G]above
In the [C]day you might be shopping
But in the [D]nighttime you [D7]better make sure it's [G]love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
To get your satisfaction
You might take [F]any guaran[C]tee that comes [G]along
But [C]without the main attraction
Though It's [F]merely a [C]distraction then [G]again you're gone
It's [A]either money or love you're [F]diggin' for
[C]Seldom love is [G]valued more
But [F]only love can [D7]tell you who's the [G]one
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
There is a [C]lot you can do with money sometimes
It seems like a [F]blessing from [G]above
In the [C]day you might be shopping
But in the [D]nighttime you [D7]better make sure it's [G]love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
You better make [D7]sure it's [G]love
You better make [D7]sure it's [G]love
I said you better make [D7]sure it's [G]love
Well you [F]better make [C]sure it's [G]love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
(Money or love) you better make [F]sure
[G](Money or love) you better make [D7]sure
[G](Money or love) you know you better make [D7]sure it's [G]love
{end_of_verse}
