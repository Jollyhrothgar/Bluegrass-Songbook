[G]Now some folks use a motor car to end it all you see
While others jump off buildings to [A7]reach eterni[D7]ty

But I would pick a sweeter way when it [D7]comes my turn to [G]go

Wanna be [C]squeezed and teased and [G]tortured

I’d never wreck my motor car or jump off buildings too
If I could have the pleasure of [A7]just one look at [D7]you

I’d think of far more pleasant ways to [D7]leave this world [G]behind
