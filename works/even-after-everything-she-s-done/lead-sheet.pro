{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Yesterday tomorrow seemed a [F]million years [C]away
But here [F]it is just twenty four hours [C]later
And I [F]find that [G7]I still miss some[C]one
I said I could despise her by the [F]dawn of another [C]day
But there's the [F]sun and I don't [C]hate her
[F]Even after [G7]everything she's [C]done
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [F]convince myself I'd get her off my [C]mind
A good night [G7]sleep and things would be all [C]right
[F]When I woke up this morning and now I [C]realize
That I [D7]can't forget her over [G7]night
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]I've tried to make myself believe that [F]I'm much better [C]off
I've told [F]myself she's nothing [C]special
And [F]still I find [G7]that she's the only [C]one
And if I lived a million years I [F]know I'd never [C]change
I'd take her [F]back and I'd for[C]give her
[F]Even after [G7]everything she's [C]done
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
