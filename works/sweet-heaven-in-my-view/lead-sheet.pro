{start_of_chorus}
Got [D]sweet heaven in my view hallelujah
On my [G]journey I press on praise [D]the [D]lord
For [G]I’m bound for that [D]holy city
Got sweet [A]heaven in [D]my view
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Oh my [D]mother she died and left me
I’m [G]alone in this world I’m alone [D]all alone
And [G]my father he [D]wont own me
Got to [A]find me [D]another home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh you need not talk about me
Just because I am crippled and blind
For I’ve got my ticket purchased
I’ll reach heaven  on time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And [D]when I get to heaven
Take [G]a seat and [D]sit right down
Looking [G]up to my [D]heavenly father
Looking [A]for a robe and [D]a crown
{end_of_verse}
