{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Today I'm like a leaf in [D7]autumn 
Never again to know the [G]spring
Today my heart is at rock [D7]bottom 
Sorrow [A7]nothing else could [D7]bring
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But those [G]words you told [D7]me just [G]today 
You said I'm [D7]only in your [G]way
You left me and what could I [D7]say 
For my world ended [G]today
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I turned and gazed into the [D7]darkness 
But no tomorrow could I [G]see
And I remember your remark [D7]yes 
I [A7]recall our used to [D7]be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I [G]have a [D7]treasure [G]yesterday 
Something [D7]you can't take [G]away
I'm lost I'll never find my [D7]way 
For my world ended [G]today
{end_of_verse}
