{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]A violet fell in love with a [G7]rose 
And started it blushing from its head to its [C]toes
Then one day the rose was [C7]kissed by the [F]dew
A new love was [C]born and the [G7]violet turned [C]blue
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Roses are red [C7]violets are [F]blue 
I'm sending [G7]red   red roses to [C]you
If you care to send [C7]some flowers to [F]me 
Then send me some [C]violets I'm [G7]blue as can [C]be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I wanted my love to bouquet with [G7]you 
But just like the rose you've proven [C]untrue
A flower that's wild [C7]they say has no [F]home 
And just like the [C]violet  I'm left [G7]all [C]alone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Roses are red [C7]violets are [F]blue 
I'm sending [G7]red   red roses to [C]you
If you care to send [C7]some flowers to [F]me 
Then send me some [C]violets I'm [G7]blue as can [C]be
