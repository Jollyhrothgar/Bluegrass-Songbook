{start_of_verse}
Well it’s Friday night at the Legion hall in some Alberta town
And from the stage I see you as you look me up and down
Later on you’ll ask me if I’ll share some time with you
I’ll say sorry honey not tonight I’m just a passin’ through
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Now I may be a stranger to this little country town
But in your eyes I recognize a man who gets around
You say you want to be with me and make my dreams come true
But I pay no mind I know your kind and I’m just a passin’ through
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
They tell me that they’ve never heard a singer quite so sweet
And when I play the fast ones it just knocks them them off their feet
Well I don’t mind the compliment but I’m nobody’s fool
I don’t pay no mind they’re not my kind
and I’m a just a passin’ through
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Well I don’t know how many times before I’ve met a man like you
Who thinks I’m something special on account of what I do
I can tell you I’m no different from the girl who cooks for you
I’m just cookin’ on this old guitar and I’m singin’ songs for you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Don’t think that you’re the only one it happens all the time
You cowboys think you’ll win my prize by handing me a line
Why don’t you let me sing my songs there’s other girls to woo
And I’ll make a bet you you won’t regret that I was just a passin’ through
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Well nobody told me this is how I’d have to pay my dues
But I’ll be long gone before too long ’cause I’m just a passin’ through
{end_of_verse}
