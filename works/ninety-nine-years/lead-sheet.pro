{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]My mama always told me better than to [D7]play with a loaded gun
If I'da just listened to her she'da never had a [G]prisoner for a son
The picture's still in front of my eyes the [C]echo in my [G]ears
When the [D7]jury said he's guilty and the judge said ninety-nine [G]years
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh for ninety-nine years I'll watch the sun rise [D7]over that same old sea
Ninety-nine years nothing but an empty [G]cell for company
Yet there's not very much that stands between me 
And the [C]freedom I hold [G]dear
Just a [D7]thousand bars a big brick wall 
And a sentence of ninety-nine [G]years
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I kissed my darling on her tender lips and they [D7]took me by the hand
I had a nice little ride on a ferry boat 
To the [G]rock where the prison stands
The warden said as he locked the door I [C]hope you'll like it [G]here
Just [D7]make yourself at home you're gonna be with us ninety-nine [G]years
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I've almost forgotten what my real name is been a [D7]number for so long
Making little bitty rocks out of great big rocks 
Gets [G]old as the days wear on
But I'll do my best for ninety-nine years just [C]try to stay [G]alive
Cause the [D7]Governor said if I'd be good I'd get out in ninety-[G]five
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh for ninety-nine years I'll watch the sun rise [D7]over that same old sea
Ninety-nine years nothing but an empty [G]cell for company
Yet there's not very much that stands between me 
And the [C]freedom I hold [G]dear
Just a [D7]thousand bars a big brick wall 
And a sentence of ninety-nine [G]years
{end_of_verse}
