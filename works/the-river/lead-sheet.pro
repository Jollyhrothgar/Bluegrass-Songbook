{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]You know a dream is like a river 
Ever [F]changing as it [C]flows
And a [F]dream is just a [C]vessel 
That must [Am]follow where it [G7]goes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Trying to [C]learn from what's [G7]behind you 
And never [Am]knowing what's in [F]store
Makes each [C]day a constant battle 
Just to [G7]stay between the [C]shores
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And I will sail my vessel 
Till the [F]river runs [C]dry
Like a [F]bird upon the [C]wind 
These [Dm]waters are my [G7]sky
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I'll never [C]reach my destination 
If [F]I never try
So I will [C]sail my vessel 
Until the [G7]river runs [C]dry
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Too many times we stand aside 
And let the [F]waters slip [C]away
Till what we [F]put off till [C]tomorrow 
Has [Dm]now become [G7]today
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
So don't you [C]sit upon the shoreline 
And [Am]say you're satis[F]fied
[C]Choose to chance the rapids 
And [G7]dare to dance the [C]tide
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And I will sail my vessel 
Till the [F]river runs [C]dry
Like a [F]bird upon the [C]wind 
These [Dm]waters are my [G7]sky
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I'll never [C]reach my destination 
If [F]I never try
So I will [C]sail my vessel 
Until the [G7]river runs [C]dry
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Well [Am]there's bound to be rough [F]waters 
And [C]I know I'll take some [F]falls
But with the good [Dm]Lord as my [C]captain 
I can [F]make it through them [G7]all
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And I will sail my vessel 
Till the [F]river runs [C]dry
Like a [F]bird upon the [C]wind 
These [Dm]waters are my [G7]sky
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I'll never [C]reach my destination 
If [F]I never try
So I will [C]sail my vessel 
Until the [G7]river runs [C]dry
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
[F]Yes I will [C]sail my vessel 
Until the [G7]river runs [C]dry
Until the [G7]river runs [C]dry
{end_of_verse}
