[G7]But the path of that lone [C]Galilean
[G7]With joy I will [D7]follow [G7]today
[C]And the toils of the road will seem [F]nothing
[G7]When I get to the end of [C]the [G7]way
[C]And the toils of the road will seem [F]nothing
[G7]When I get to the end of the [C]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}

[G7]Knows just what is needful and [C]best

[C]And the toils of the road will seem [F]nothing
[G7]When I get to the end of the [C]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[F]When the last feeble step has been taken
[G7]And the gates of that city [C]appear
[F]And the beautiful songs of the angels
[G7]Float out on my listening [C]ear
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
[G7]When all that now seems so [C]mysterious
[G7]Will be bright and [D7]as clear as the [G7]day
[C]And the toils of the road will seem [F]nothing
[G7]When I get to the end of [C]the [G7]way
[C]Then the toils of the road will seem [F]nothing
[G7]When I get to the end of the [C]way
{end_of_verse}
