{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I've heard all your answers but there's one thing I wish you'd [F]explain[C]  [F]
[G7]How you sign a few papers and wash seven years down the [C]drain [G7]    [C]
Pack up a few things and just walk away from it [F]all[C]  [F]
[G7]You with your freedom and me with my back to the [C]wall [F]   [G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [C]suppose in my mind I could find things that I didn't [F]do [C]  [F]
[G7]But I heard it said somewhere that hindsight's a fool's point of [C]view [G7]   [C]
And the point is it's over and you've walked away standin' [F]tall[C]  [F]
[G7]You with your reasons and me with my back to the [C]wall [G7]    [C]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And [F]you're leavin' me with a mind full of dreams made of [C]sand
Headache and heartbreak and all kinds of time on my [G7]hands
[C]I just sit in the back row and wait for the curtain to [F]fall [C]  [F]
[G7]You've got the future and I've got my back to the [C]wall [F]   [G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]But you can't pick a wild flower and not have it wither and [F]die [C]  [F]
[G7]Or build a sand castle that won't wash away with the [C]tide [G7]    [C]
And you can't keep a wild bird from leavin' at the first signs of [F]fall[C]  [F]
[G7]You've got your freedom and I've got my back to the [C]wall [G7]    [C]
[G7]You've got your freedom and I've got my back to the [C]wall
{end_of_verse}
