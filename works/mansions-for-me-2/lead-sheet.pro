{start_of_verse}
There’s folks building homes as sweet as can be
They’re leveling their yards they’re planting their trees
But my little hut I’ll just let it be
For Jesus is building a mansion for me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Mansion for me (mansion for me)
A mansion for me (a mansion for me)
Built by my Lord beyond Calvary
But my little hut I’ll just let it be
For Jesus is building a mansion for me
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
Each day I am getting more ready to go
I’m cleansing my sins more whiter than snow
I’m packing my troubles bound with his love
Getting ready to move to heaven above
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
To you who have homes in this world below
Driving fine cars wherever you roam
There’s coming a time when we’ll all pass away
Get ready to move with me on that day
{end_of_verse}
