[C]I hear your new love sends you [F]pretty 
Something [C]different each [G7]day
And [C]he never for[F]gets to call when[C]ever he's [G7]away
He sends [C]you candy and flowers [C7]tied in ribbons of [F]blue
Why didn't [G7]I think of that before I lost [C]you

He takes you [F]dancing [C]out with the [G7]crowd
And when [C]you walk be[F]side him [C]he looks so [G7]proud
He does [C]thoughtful little things [C7]that I didn't [F]do
Why didn't [G7]I think of that before I lost [C]you

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]I was [G7]afraid if you [F]looked at someone [C]else
You'd [F]leave me for [G7]him and [C]I'd be by my[G7]self
Jealou[C]sy made me blind too late [C7]I know that it's [F]true
Why didn't [G7]I think of that before I lost [C]you
