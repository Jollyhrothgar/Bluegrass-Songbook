{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Whenever I go out anywhere in town
I look for a crowd where you're not hangin' [G7]round
Say that I won't [C]give your memory any [D7]room but every time I [G]do
Just when I think I can take another's hand
Get on with my life won't look back [G7]again
Promise I won't [C]keep comparin' them to [D7]you but every time I [G]do [C]

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G]Every time I [Em]do I wish I didn't try to [G]tell myself 
But I just don't listen it's a [A7]fool who just goes on missin'
What he [C]can't have back he [D7]never learns his lesson
I [C]say I'll forget her oh but [D7]I know better
Cause I [G]know by now we don't [A7]belong together
Shouldn't get the [C]blues when I think of [D7]you but every time I [G]do
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}

Keep both hands on the wheel don't even make that [G7]turn
Swear that I won't [C]go down Maple [D7]Avenue but every time I [G]do
