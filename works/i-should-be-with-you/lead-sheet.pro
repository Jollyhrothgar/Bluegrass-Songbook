[G]Last night I met an old love
[C]And just to pass the [G]time
[D7]We did some of the things we used to do
[G]But as I held her in my arms
[C]This thought ran through my [G]mind
[D7]Oh I should be with [G]you

[C]I held her close but that old thrill
[G]I used to know was gone
[C]I kissed her lips and then I knew

[G]I couldn't win my conscience
[C]This thought kept coming [G]through
[D7]Oh I should be with [G]you
