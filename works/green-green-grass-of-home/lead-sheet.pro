{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]The old home town looks the same
[F]As I step down from the [C]train
[G7]And there to meet me is my mama and my papa
[C]Down the road I look and there runs Mary
[F]Hair of gold and lips like cherries
[C]It's good to touch the [G7]green green grass of [C]home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The old house is still standing
[F]Though the paint is cracked and [C]dry
[G7]And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
[C]Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary
[F]Hair of gold and lips like cherries
[C]It's good to touch the [G7]green green grass of [C]home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Yes they'll all come to see me
[F]Arms reaching smiling sweetly
[C]It's good to touch the
[G7]Green green grass of [C]home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Then I awake and look around me
[F]To the cold gray walls that surround [C]me
[G7]And then I realize that I was only dreaming
[C]For there's a guard and there's a sad old padre
[F]Arm and arm I'll walk at daybreak
[C]Again I'll touch the [G7]green grass of [C]home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Yes they'll all come to see me
[F]In the shade of the old oak tree
[C]As they lay me beneath
[G7]The green green grass [F]of [C]home
{end_of_verse}
