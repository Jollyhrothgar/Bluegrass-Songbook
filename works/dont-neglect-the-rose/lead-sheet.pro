{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
There [G]stands a rose down in your garden
You left [D7]it there so [G]all alone
It’s been neglected feels unwanted
Since [D7]no love to it [G]is shown
It’s beauty now is fastly fading
Once [D7]it was the [G]brightest red
It’s withering fast its head is bowing
And no [D7]kind words to it [G]are said
Please don’t neglect the rose in your garden
Show it [D7]your love [G]every day
Then it will bloom for you in all its beauty
And [D7]it will not [G]fade away
I guess by now you know my story
Don’t [D7]neglect a love [G]that’s true
For it may prove to be the sweetest flower
That [D7]will ever [G]bloom for you
It could be a mother sister or brother
A [D7]husband wife or [G]little child
Or it may be your own true lover
That [D7]you’ve neglected [G]all the while
