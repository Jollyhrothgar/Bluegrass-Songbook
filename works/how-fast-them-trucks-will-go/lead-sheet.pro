{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]You know a lot of folk stop at truck stops
They just [F]naturally think they should
Well they [G7]figure any place that a truck driver eats
The [C]food's just gotta be good
So they go there amongst all them truckers
Sittin' and [F]talkin' about their loads
Talkin' [G7]'bout women and stuff like that
And how [C]fast them trucks'll go [F]   [G7]    [C]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
There's a little old place on I-76
Where a [F]lot of them drivers stop and get their kicks
[G7]Reckless eye-balling this waitress they got called [C]Flo
Now there's always a bunch and they're a-hangin' out
Just [F]cuttin' up and talkin' about
How she [G7]wiggles when she walks and stuff like that
And how [C]fast them trucks'll go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
It's a wonder a fella can sit down and eat
His [F]ham an' eggs or his bread and meat
With a [G7]good lookin' woman like that around on the [C]go
First thing you know you start to fidget and fussin'
[F]Nudgin' one another instead of discussin'
Just [G7]how she wiggles when she walks and stuff like that
And how [C]fast them trucks'll go [F]   [G7]    [C]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Well old Flo just takes it all in stride
And [F]swells all up with her woman pride
She's tickled all [G7]plum pink y'all come in just to see her [C]show
Yeah she throws in an little extra little wiggle in her walk
And [F]you just sit there and grin and gawk
About [G7]homemade lovin' and stuff like that
And how [C]fast them trucks'll go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Now I can't explain it how it makes you feel
But you [F]tip her five bucks on a two dollar bill
Get [G7]yourself an' start headin' out kinda [C]slow
When you're pushin' that diesel on down the line
And you get to [F]thinkin' 'bout the woman you've left behind
How she [G7]wiggles when she walks and stuff like that
And just how [C]fast them trucks'll go [F]   [G7]    [C]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Ah them trucks'll go a little faster
When you get to thinkin' 'bout that woman you've left behind [F]
[G7]Goodbye officer and [C]Smokey
Just how fast will them [F]trucks go
{end_of_verse}
