{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Come [G]all ye [C]fair and [G]tender ladies
Take [G]warning [C]how you court [D]your men
They’re [D]like [Am7]a star on a [G]summer morning
They [G]first [Am7]appear and then [D]they’re gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
They’ll [G]tell [C]to you some [G]loving story
And [G]they’ll make you [C]think that they love you [D]well
And [D]away [Am7]they’ll go and [G]court some other
And leave you there in grief to dwell
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I wish I was on some tall mountain
Where the ivy rocks were black as ink
I’d [D]write [Am7]a letter to my [G]false true lover
Whose cheeks are like the morning pink
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I [G]wish [C]I was a little [G]sparrow
And I had wings to fly so high
I’d [D]fly [Am7]to the arms of my [G]false true lover
And [G]when [Am7]he’d ask, I [D]would deny
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Oh love is handsome, love is charming
And love is pretty while it’s new
But love grows cold as love grows older
And fades away like morning dew
{end_of_verse}
