{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Back [G]in the days of [C]my childhood
In the [G]evening when everything [D]was still
I [G]used to sit and listen to [C]the fox hounds
With my [G]dad in [D]the old [G]Kentucky hills
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
I’m [G]on my way back to [C]the old home,
That road winds on up the hill
But [G]there’s no light in the [C]window,
That [G]shined long [D]ago where I [G]lived
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Soon [G]my childhood [C]days were over
I had [G]to leave my old [D]home
For [G]my mom and dad [C]were called to heaven
I was [G]left in [D]this world all [G]alone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
High [G]in the hills of [C]old Kentucky
Stands [G]the fondest part of my [D]memory
I’m [G]on my way back to [C]the old home
That [G]light in the [D]window I [G]long to see
{end_of_verse}
