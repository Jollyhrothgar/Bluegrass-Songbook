{start_of_verse}
Now I was a stranger in love and in town
You set me up then you put me down
You had your way with me every time
But leaving would take that load off my mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
You wanted love and you wanted more
People and places like never before
You ran around like you thought I was blind
But leaving would take that load off my mind
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
Now you had me fooled from the day that we met
Sweet lies you told me I’ll never forget
But you can’t keep lying and love and you’ll find
Cause leaving will take that load off my mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Now don’t you be waiting for my knock on your door
That kind of loving I don’t need no more
You had your day until it came time
For leaving will take that load off my mind
{end_of_verse}
