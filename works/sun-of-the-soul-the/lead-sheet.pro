{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
When the [G]sun of your life has gone down
And the [D]clouds in the west turn [G]to gold
Endless death will to you then have [C]come
If the [D]light has gone out in [G]your soul
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Oh just [G]think how in death you would feel
With the [D]light growing dim in [G]your soul
Oh how long it will be oh how [C]still
If the [D]light has gone out in [G]your soul
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
When you [G]come to the end of the way
And life’s [D]story for you has [G]been told
Oh how sad all to you will [C]appear
If the [D]light has gone out in [G]your soul
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
When the [G]chilly winds of death around you steal
And the [D]sweat upon your brow is damp [G]and cold
What a dread in your life you would [C]feel
If the [D]light has gone out in [G]your soul
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
When [G]before the judgment trial you shall stand
And the [D]deeds of your life have [G]been told
Good and evil appears oh what [C]then
If the [D]light has gone out in [G]your soul
{end_of_verse}
