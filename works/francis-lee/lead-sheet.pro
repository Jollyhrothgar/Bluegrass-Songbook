{start_of_verse}
In the evening by the moonlight
Down beside the silver sea
We strolled hand in hand together
You and I my Francis Lee
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Please forgive me little darlin
If you set my conscience free
My lonely heart is broken
Over you my Francis Lee
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
Francis Lee I dearly love you
Though I said that we must part
Many times I have regretted
That I broke your lovin’ heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I’m alone now sad and lonely
Oh how grave my sorrow be
Your sweet memory still haunts me
And my conscience bothers me
{end_of_verse}
