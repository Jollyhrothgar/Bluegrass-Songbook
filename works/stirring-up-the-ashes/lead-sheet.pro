{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I’m stirring up the ashes of [E7]an old flame of [C]mine
[D7]Stomping any ember that may [G]still be left [D7]behind
[G]If I find the spark still glowing from the love that we once [C]knew
[D7]Then I’ll keep stirring ashes till I’ve forgotten [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[D7]When flames of love are leaping they seem to seek the [G]sky
[A7]But a wisp of wilting water was your each and every [D7]lie
[G]The flame that once was raging has simmered to the [C]ground
[D7]And I’m stirring ashes to be sure you’re not [G]around
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[E7]I’m stirring up the ashes from an old love [C]affair
[D7]To be certain nothing lingers to be [G]sure that I don’t [D7]care
[G]A coal left unattended may be tempted by the [C]wind
[D7]To flame up in a romance that I never want [G]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[D7]I was just a sacrifice to your lover’s [G]power
[A7]A lamb led to the slaughter as my hopes reach high and [D7]higher
[G]Something subtle may be buried in those ashes deep and [C]gray
[D7]So I’ll keep stirring ashes to be sure you stay [G]away
{end_of_verse}
