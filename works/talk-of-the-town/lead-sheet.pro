{start_of_verse}
Now people seem to watch my footsteps as I go by
They shake their heads and say I’m riding high
But this thing has done drove me wild and now it’s got me down
And made me the talk of the town
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
I’ll go down to the river and slowly walk around
And if my thoughts don’t change a lot I’ll jump right in and drown
For after what you’ve done to me I know I’ve grown to be
The laughing stock the talk of the town
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
I used to think this couldn’t happen to a guy like me
As nightfall finds me headed to your door
Now you don’t seem to want me since a new love you have found
And now I am the talk of the town
{end_of_verse}
