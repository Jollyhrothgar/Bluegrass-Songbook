{start_of_chorus}
All [A]my ex’s live [E]in [E7]Texas
And [E]Texas is [Bm7]the place I’d [Bm7]dearly [Bb7]love [A]to be
But [A]all my ex’s live [E]in [E7]Texas
And that’s [E]why I hang [E7]my hat in [A]Tennessee.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Rosanna’s [A]down in [Bm]Texarcana wanted me to push her broom
And [E]sweet Arlene [E7]in [E]Abilene she forgot I [A]owned the moon
And [A]Allison in Galviston [Bm]somehow lost her sanity
And [B7]Dimples who now lives in Temple’s got [E]the law looking for me.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [A]remember that old Rio [Bm]river where I learned to swim
But [E]it brings to [E7]mind another time [E]when I wore my [A]welcome thin
My [A]transcendental [Bm]meditation I go there each night
But [B7]I’ll always come back to [E]myself long before daylight.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Some [E]folks think I’m [D]hiding[D#][E]
it’s been rumored that I [D]died[D#][E]
But I’m alive and well in [A]Tennessee.[D][A6][D#][E]
