{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Have you ever stopped and listened at the way that a city sheds its [C]tears
At the [D7]streams of the junky who needs nothing more than just a needle [G]by
I can smell a grass a burnin' some fool next door wants to charge his [C]mind
These [D7]apartment walls are thin and the sound just walks right in
Tells me how the city cries at [G]night
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Some drunk he stumbles from the curb and mumbles and he tries to hail a [C]cab
Some [D7]woman runs out from a bar a shoutin' that her lover's in a [G]fight
That old meat wagon's rollin' I guess somebody's either heard her [C]died
The [D7]corner preacher just begins to tell us all about our sins
That's another way the city cries at [G]night
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I hear a siren whinin' and that sound don't help to lift a lonely [C]soul
I [D7]smell the rubber burnin' two cats are draggin' out from light to [G]light
Some wino walks along the curb and drinks his empty bottle in the [C]street
These [D7]apartment walls are thin and the sound just walks right in
Tells me how the city cries at [G]night
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
The jet eats up the runway as it moans and groans and reaches for the [C]blue
My [D7]baby rides her wings she's got a lovin' with some swingin' disco [G]guy
She left her screamin' heart behind when her lips made the sound of [C]goodbye
These [D7]apartment walls are thin and the sound just walks right in
Tells me how the city cries at [G]night
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
The [D7]walls of my heart are thin and the hurt it just walks right in
Tells me how the city cries at [G]night
{end_of_verse}
