Standing with the angels on [A7]the golden [D7]stair

I heard the angels singing [C]songs of peace and [G]rest
And then there was a silence each [A7]eye looked toward the [D7]west
[G]There sat my Savior on His [C]golden [G]throne
Last [C]night I dreamed of [G]heaven my [D7]eternal home sweet [G]home

Last [C]night I dreamed of [G]heaven [D7]the land of eternal [G]life
