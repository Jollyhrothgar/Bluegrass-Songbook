{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
You [C]have heard of little Moses in the bulrush
You have heard of fearless David and his [G7]sling
You have heard the story told of dreaming [G7]Joseph
And of Jonah and the whale you often [C]sing
There [C]are many, many others through the Bible
I should like to meet them all I do [G7]declare
By [G7]and by the Lord will surely let us meet them
At that [G7]meeting in [C]the air
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
There [C]is going to be a meeting in the air
In the sweet sweet bye and [G7]bye
I [G7]am going to meet you, meet you over there
In that home beyond the [C]sky
Such [C]singing you will hear—never heard by mortal ear
‘Twill be glorious I do [F]declare
And God’s own son will [C]be the leading one
At the [G7]meeting in [C]the air
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Many things there will be missing in that meeting
For the mourner’s bench will have no place at all
There will never be a sermon preached to sinners
For the sinners had refused to heed the call
There will be no mourning over wayward loved ones
There will be no lonely nights of pleading prayer
All our burdens and our anguish will be lifted
At that [G7]meeting in [C]the air
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
There the doubters will be missing altogether
All the skeptics will be absent on that day
There will be no grumblers present to disturb us
And the Achans will be busy far away
There the saints will have His seal upon their foreheads
Dressed in raiment none but ransomed ones can wear
All who have the wedding garment will be present
At that [G7]meeting in [C]the air
{end_of_verse}
