And you [D7]feel that there's no use to carry [G]on

And [G]careth [D7]for His [G]own
So [D7]trust in Him and faith will lead you [G]on

Standing somewhere in the [C]shadows you'll find [G]Jesus

And you'll [D7]know Him by the nail prints in His [G]hands

Old Satan often [C]tempts you and [G]tries to make you doubt

He'll [D7]comfort you and give you grace to [G]stand
