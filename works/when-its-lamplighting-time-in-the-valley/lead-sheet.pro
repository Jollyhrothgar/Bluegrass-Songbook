{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
There’s a [E]lamp [A]shining bright in [E]a cabin
In the window it’s shining [B]for me
And I [E]know that [A]my mother [E]is praying
For the [B]boy she is longing [E]to [E7]see
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
When it’s [A]lamp lighting time in [E]the valley
Still in dreams I go back to [B]my home
I can [E]see that [A]old lamp in [E]the window
It [B]will guide me wherever I [E]roam.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
In the [A]lamplight tonight I [E]can see her
As she rocks in her chair to and [B]fro
Though she prays that I’ll come back to see her
Still I know that I never can go.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
When it’s [A]lamp lighting time in [E]the valley
Still in dreams I go back to [B]my home
But I’ve sinned ‘gainst my home and my loved ones
And now i must ever more roam
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
So she [E]lights up [A]the lamp and [E]sits waiting
For she knows not the crime i have [B]done
So I’ve  [E]changed all [A]my ways  and [E]I’ll meet her
Up in [B]heaven when life’s race [E]is run.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
When it’s [A]lamp lighting time in [E]the valley
Still in dreams I go back to [B]my home
Oh I [E]can see that [A]old lamp in [E]the window
It [B]will guide me wherever [E]I roam
{end_of_chorus}
