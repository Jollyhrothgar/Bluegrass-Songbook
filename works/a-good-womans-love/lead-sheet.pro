{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I [G]was a rover, on land and [Em]on sea
’til a good woman’s [G]love made [D]a new man [G]of me
Life had no meaning, it was so [Em]incomplete
’til a good woman’s [G]love put [D]me back on my [G]feet
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Still [C]a-roamin’ I go home in the evening and she’s [G]waiting there
and I know that no [C]matter what happens she’ll always [D]care
and when [G]night falls and the moon shines [Em]above
I’m a man with a [G]dream and a good woman’s love
{end_of_chorus}
