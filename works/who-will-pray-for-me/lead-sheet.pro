{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]My rough and [F]rowdy [C]ways have kept me [F]from His [C]grace
But there's hope for [F]me cause [C]momma‘s faith is [G7]strong
[C]She’s the only [F]hope I’ve [C]got to keep me [F]in touch with [C]God
But who’ll [F]pray for [C]me when [G7]momma’s [C]gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Who’ll pray for [F]me when momma’s [C]gone
Who’ll ask his forgiveness from then [G7]on
[C]Who’ll care enough to talk to God
[F]When her pleading [C]voice has stopped
Who’ll [F]pray for [C]me when [G7]momma’s [C]gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I guess [F]I’m just too [C]weak to fall [F]down on my [C]knees 
And talk to God [F]like a [C]man on my [G7]own
[C]He knows [F]who I [C]am she mentions [F]me to [C]Him
But who’ll [F]pray for [C]me when [G7]momma’s [C]gone
{end_of_verse}
