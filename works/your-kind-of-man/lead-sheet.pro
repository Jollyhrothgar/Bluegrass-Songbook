{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]With a heavy [F]heart I write this [C]letter
To let you know [F]exactly where I [C]stand
Things have [F]gotten worse instead of [C]better
And now the [G7]situation's out of [C]hand
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You brought dis[F]honor to the ring you're [C]wearin'
Be kind enough to [F]take it from your [C]hand
Inside my heart I [F]feel like something’s [C]tearin'
Cause [F]I know I [G7]can't be your kind of [C]man
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I [G7]never filled a dream lost that [F]you ever tried to [C]share
I don't [F]think that I [G7]ever fit your [C]plans
Cause [G7]you always walked on me [F]just like I wasn't [C]there
And I [F]know I [G7]can't be your kind of [C]man
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Some morning if the [F]sun should catch you [C]cryin'
And there's not a soul [F]around who [C]understands
When you hurt so much your [F]only hope is [C]dyin'
Only [F]then will you be [G7]hurting like I [F]am[C]
{end_of_verse}
