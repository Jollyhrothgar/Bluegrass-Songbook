{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]He's Cadillac Jack Favor and the name rings true
If [C]he's got a ride any stranger would too
The [G]one bad habit that his ponder would say
Is [D7]sure gonna put him through the trials one day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And [G]that's just what happened he took pity on two men
Headin' [C]down to Louisiana he stopped and let 'em in
And the [G]thanks he'd get for helpin' them
Would [D7]make him wish he was bustin' broncs [G]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
He dropped 'em [C]off in Bossier City where they [G]met up with a man
Now that [F]vagabond committee barely [D7]even had a plan
It [G]was just a simple robbery turned double homi[C]cide
And they got [G]away with murder it'd be [D7]someone else's [G]hide
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Almost two years come and gone they never solved that crime
Till they [C]found one of our vagabonds already doing [G]time
And when that jailbird started singing 
They know all the words were wrong
But the [D7]sheriff and the DA and the judge all sang along
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
They [G]pinned it on Jack Favor gave him life without parole
Gave Jack's [C]freedom to the jailbird payment on the lies he told
And it just so [G]happens that election year 
[D7]Everybody made out at the [G]polls
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Cadillac's no [C]fallen hero and he's [G]never gonna break
When it [F]comes to prison rodeo there'll [D7]be no easy eight
And if you [G]want the definition of a picture perfect [C]frame
It be [G]in the dictionary [D7]underneath Jack Favor's [G]name
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Cadillac's no [C]fallen hero and he's [G]never gonna break
When it [F]comes to prison rodeo there'll [D7]be no easy eight
And if you [G]want the definition of a picture perfect [C]frame
It be [G]in the dictionary [D7]underneath Jack Favor's [G]name
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
Yeah it's the world's most crooked picture 
And when it comes to being [C]framed 
[G]Cadillac Jack Favor should be [D7]in the Hall of [G]Fame
{end_of_verse}
