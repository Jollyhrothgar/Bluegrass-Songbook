{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]It must have been an awful thing that someone did to [C]you
[D7]That built the wall around your heart that I can't break [G]through
[C]I can't erase I can't replace the bitter for the sweet
[D7]For I can't find my way behind your wall of [G]memories
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]If you want me why I can't keep you in love with me
[D7]You say you're mine and I'm not blind I know you want to [G]be
[C]And when you're holding me no sweeter love could ever be
[D7]But when I'm gone somehow I can't keep you in love with [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]The worst mistake that you could make the surest way to lose
[D7]Would be to listen and believe the lies they tell to [G]you
[C]There is a way you can repay the one who let you down
[D7]Let me repair your broken heart don't leave it on the [G]ground
