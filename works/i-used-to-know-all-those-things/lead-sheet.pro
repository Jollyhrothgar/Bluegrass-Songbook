{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I used to know all those things 
Like honeymoons and wedding rings
The [G7]happiness that love can bring 
I used to know [C]all those things
A morning kiss an evening touch 
Those hours of doing nothing much
That [G7]special way a heart can sing 
I used to know [C]all those things
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]Our happy home with love inside 
Was weakened soon and [G7]then destroyed
[F]When we made a room for [C]foolish pride there [G7]too
Once [C]happy times were mine to know 
They seem to be so long ago
But [G7]once upon a wedding ring 
I used to know [C]all those things
{end_of_verse}
