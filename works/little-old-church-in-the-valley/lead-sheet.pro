{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G7]In the [C]little old [G7]church in the [C]valley
Where I first learned of [G7]sorrow and [C]joy
I can [F]see mother there 
With her [C]head bowed in prayer
As she [D7]prayed for her wandering [G7]boy
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
It was [C]there that I [G7]first found my [C]Sally
Like an [F]angel on earth so it [E7]seems
When she [A7]sang sweet and low in the [D7]long long ago
In the [C]little old [G7]church of my [C]dreams [G7]
{end_of_verse}
