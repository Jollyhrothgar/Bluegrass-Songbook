[C]Clear creeks and cool mountain mornings
[F]Honest work out in the [C]fields
Cornbread in my momma's kitchen

[G7]Family ties run deep in this [F]land

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I was [F]born [C]country and that's [G7]what I'll always [C]be
Like the [F]rivers and the [C]woodlands wild and [G7]free
I got a [F]hundred years of [C]down home
[G7]Running through my [Am]blood
I was [F]born [C]country and this [G7]country's what I [C]love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Moonlight and you hear beside me
[F]Crickets serenading in the [C]yard

Now [G7]this is where I wanna raise my [F]kids
[G7]Just the way my mom and daddy [F]did [G7]
