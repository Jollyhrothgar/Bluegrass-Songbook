{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]It's a shame we didn't make it
Everybody thought we were the perfect [F]pair
Any[Dm]time I needed someone
I could [F]always turn [G7]around and find you [C]there[Dm]   [G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But a [C]good loves don't come easy
And sometimes the strongest love could fall [F]apart
Now I'm [Dm]looking for some [A7]memories
Going [Dm]through the broken [G7]pieces of my [C]heart[F]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
It's a [C]shame we didn't make it
Heaven knows it's not because we didn't [F]try
But some[Dm]times you just can't help it
And it's [F]best to walk [G7]away and let it [C]die[Dm]   [G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]All I want is some small keepsake
From a love that seemed to have the perfect [F]start
So I'm [Dm]looking for some [A7]memories
Going [Dm]through the broken [G7]pieces of my [C]heart[F]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[C]I'm not looking for the answer
Cause I know that without question
When [Em]love's gone it's [F]gone[Em]    [F]
I just [Dm]thought I might find something
Hidden [G7]somewhere in the pieces
I could [F]take [C]along[G7]
