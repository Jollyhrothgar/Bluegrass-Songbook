{start_of_verse}
Why do you cry little darlin
Why are those tears in your eyes
Why do you weep little darlin
Just when I say goodbye
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
It makes me sad and lonely
To see you feel so blue
What have I done little darlin
I have I been untrue to you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Cause you are called little darlin
To fight for your country true
There’s many a poor girl just like me
Weeping for their sweetheart too
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I’ve tried so hard to be cheerful
But thought of all the long years
You might be gone little darlin
I could not keep back my tears
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
That’s why I cry little darlin
Because you’re going away
Leaving me all broken hearted
To weep for you day after day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Every night I’ll kneel by my bedside
And ask God to guide you each day
Back to your sweetheart that’s waiting
And loves you more than I can say
{end_of_verse}
