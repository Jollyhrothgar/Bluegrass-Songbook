{start_of_chorus}
These old blues they got me down
Since my sweet thing she ain’t around
I’m so blue blue as I can be
Just as blue as the deep blue sea
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
Got up this morning I was feeling blue
Couldn’t sleep last night, just thinking of you
Tossed and turned tears in my eyes
Wondering why you said goodbye
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Now she’s gone what can I do
It’s too late to start anew
For true love is hard to find
It’s too late to turn back the time
{end_of_verse}
