{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]My desire is to speak life as those all [G7]around me are [C]dying
My [D7]desire is to speak peace at a time when the tempest is [G]tossing
I desire most of all to shine in a [G7]world filled with [C]darkness
So [D7]if You'll shine through me Lord together we'll light up the [G]world
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
So shine from the mountains search all the [G7]valleys and [C]hills
[D7]Shine on the water rescue the dying say you [G]will
Sound out the warning [G7]Jesus is coming [C]again
And the [D7]light of His Glorious image is filling the [G]land
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Oh I feel so unworthy I have no [G7]strength of my[C]self Lord  
But [D7]You said to the weak say I'm strong Lord and You are my [G]soul
As the mountains of gloom and despair loom [G7]ahead I will [C]charge them
In the [D7]sweet name of Jesus the mountains will move at Thy [G]voice
