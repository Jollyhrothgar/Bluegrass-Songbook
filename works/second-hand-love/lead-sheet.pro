{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]They tell me that there's someone else [G7]you really truly love
And even when we kiss that she's the [C]one you're thinking of
[E7]I guess it's true cause once or twice you called [Am]me by her name
[D7]I need you so but now I know that you [G7]don't feel the same
It's all over [F]town you've put me [C]down
A second hand [D7]love  a [G7]second hand [C]love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Though late at night I sit alone and [G7]count the tears that fall
I'd rather have this kind of love than [C]not see you at all
[E7]My friends all say I'm better off if [Am]we should drift apart
But [D7]every day I hope and pray I'll [G7]be first in your heart
It's all over [F]town you've put me [C]down
I'm a second hand [D7]love  a [G7]second hand [C]love
Just a second hand [D7]love  a [G7]second hand [C]love
{end_of_verse}
