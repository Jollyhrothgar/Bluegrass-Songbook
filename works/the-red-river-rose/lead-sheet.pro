{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]On a fence line north of Estelline the strangest sight I'd ever seen
Was a [F]note tied with a ribbon to a rollin' tumble[C]weed
Brazos tossed his head and shied the weed got caught upon the wire
I [F]stepped down from my saddle horse and [G7]gave that note a [C]read

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G7]Lines that were written in a [F]fair woman's [C]hand
[G7]Told of her life and the [F]loss of her [G7]man
It's her [Am]heart and her [Em]hopes she has [F]cast in the [C]wind
And it's [F]me that old [Em]tumble[F]weed chose to [G7]find Red River [C]Rose
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
By the time I built a fire that night I'd memorized every line
Felt [F]the silent teardrops that had fallen on that [C]note
I heard a lonesome coyote cry and it was then I realized
[F]Rose and this old cowboy had [G7]been too long [C]alone

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
On the north side of the prairie dog in a dugout built of cedar logs 
Stood a [F]woman in a cotton dress the color of the [C]sod
She said the man she loved had died and so to keep her occupied
He [F]tied notes to the tumbleweeds and [G7]trusted them to [C]God

In a [A]cedar cabin '[C]neath a canyon wall

I love my [G7]Red River [C]Rose
