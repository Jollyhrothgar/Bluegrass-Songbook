{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]If there's water in the desert sand out in the sea
If [C]you were not an angel sweet as you could be
You [G]could turn the night to day make all my dreams come true
Say how [C]far it is to [G]heaven then [D7]I'll stop loving [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
If the earth is up above us stars are down below
If [C]there are daisies in the desert roses in the snow
If [G]today can be tomorrow if old things can be new
If you [C]can live without a [G]heartbeat then [D7]I'll stop loving [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
There's no [D7]daisies in the desert no [G]roses in the snow
The [D7]earth is not above us the [G]stars are not below
Today can't be tomorrow old things can't be new
I can't [C]live without a [G]heartbeat and I [D7]can't stop loving [G]you 
{end_of_verse}
