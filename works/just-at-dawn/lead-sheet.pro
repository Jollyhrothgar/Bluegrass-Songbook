Suddenly [C7]became a living [F]hell
And the things that we felt [C]yesterday
Today don't feel so [G7]well

{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}

But I always put [C]simple minded 
Selfish heart of me  ahead of [G7]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]You know it never crossed my mind 
That someday I [C7]might find myself [F]alone
Until I woke this [C]morning just at dawn 
It dawned on [G7]me that you were [C]gone

[C]You know it never crossed my mind 
That someday I [C7]might find myself [F]alone
Until I woke this [C]morning just at dawn 
It dawned on [G7]me that you were [C]gone
{end_of_verse}
