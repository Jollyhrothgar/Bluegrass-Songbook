{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]My nights have been lonely since I've been [F]in Tulsa [G7]County
And I'm [C]feeling like I [G7]don't know what to [C]do
Guess I'll just mosey down [F]along that southern [G7]border
[C]Anything to get me [G7]far away from [C]you

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Got your note in Charleston saying babe [F]I really need [G7]you
But [C]when I got there  [G7]you didn't need me [C]then
It doesn't take a wise man to [F]know the life you're [G7]living
So I'll [C]just be on my way [G7]now once [C]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well I don't [F]know  [G7]just where I'll [C]go
Gonna head on down to [G7]Mexico  down to [C]Mexico

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Now you say you love me like your [F]feeling   not you're [G7]sorry
But it [C]hurts to much this [G7]time to even [C]cry
So I'll think of the good times  [F]times we almost made [G7]it
Yes I'll [C]think of you   but now  [G7]kiss me [C]goodbye
{end_of_verse}
