{start_of_verse}
You lie in our bed and dream of another
You don’t even know you whisper his name
And now if your heart belongs to another
Oh what will I do, you’re driftin away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Our once happy home is lonely and dark now
Have you went astray and broken your vows
I just can’t believe these things that I’m hearing
You’re breakin my heart is it over now
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
I wish that I knew what happened to you dear
And I only hope we’ll make it somehow
But that doesn’t change the way that I’m feeling
It hurts me to say that it’s over now
{end_of_verse}
