{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I [G]was born in the heart of the country
In a town in the middle of the [G7]land
I grew [C]up in a [G]second city
Since I left my [D]home I’ve been [G]travellin’ back.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
To [G]a time when a family tried to stay together
Back to the time when a love [G7]survived
When a woman and a [C]man built a home [G]forever
And they tied a [D]knot for the rest of [G]their lives.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
My [G]brother’s gone to New York City
And I find myself in a corner of the [G7]west
My mom and [C]daddy left their home and [G]each other
Ten miles [D]apart, more apart than [G]the rest.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I’m [G]singing songs of the poor and the homeless
I’m singing songs of a love that [G7]died
But my saddest [C]song is the song of [G]a family
A million miles [D]apart with a [G]broken tie.
{end_of_verse}
