{start_of_verse}
I never knew how much I miss you
I never knew all the tears that I’d cry
Day after day I learn my lesson
You meant forever when you said good-bye
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Last night I went out walkin’
By the café where I first met you
I sat there in the shadows
Watching young lovers do what we used to do
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I keep a letter you wrote me
Sayin’ that we’d never part
One day when I find another
I’ll tear it to pieces like you did my heart
{end_of_verse}
