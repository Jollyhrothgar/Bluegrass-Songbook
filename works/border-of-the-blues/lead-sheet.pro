{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I stopped into our old hang out
Just [D7]wandered in to look about
Countin' all the faces we once [G]knew
The thrill was gone the place seemed strange
I [D7]looked for you you never came
My heart was on the border of the [G]blues
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
A [D7]friendly smile here and there
A [C]table with an empty chair
A [G]love song I used to dance with [D7]you
But [G]since you're gone there's nothing left
I [D7]couldn't stay the way I felt
My heart was on the border of the [G]blues
{end_of_verse}
