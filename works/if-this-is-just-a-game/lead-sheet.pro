{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]If I give my love to you [F]girl  [G7]will I get love in [C]return 
Or will I just get a [F]fire  [G7]for as long as it will [C]burn
I'm not looking for a [F]lover  [G7]I don't even want a [C]friend 
I want this to last for[F]ever  [G7]and forever never [C]ends 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Don't tell me lies or hypnotize 
Me with your eyes while saying that you [G7]need me 
If this is just a one-night stand 
I'd rather turn around and walk [C]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Don't hold me in your arms 
And run your fingers through my hair if you don't [G7]love me
If this is just a game well honey 
I don't think I really care to [C]play 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I've trusted you before [F]babe  [G7]and you always let me [C]down 
I came back to you be[F]lieving  [G7]I was more than just your [C]clown
You say it will be [F]different  [G7]this time your love is [C]real 
Honey don't make me believe [F]you  [G7]if that ain't the way you [C]feel 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Don't tell me lies or hypnotize
