{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Today while driving home I passed a [D7]mansion on the hill
For a while I felt ashamed of the [C]house where we [G]live
Then you met me with open arms and [C]made my world alright
All the [D7]treasures in that mansion can't match what we'll share [G]tonight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Love don't care whose house it [C]lives in
Four [D7]walls and just two hearts is all it [G]needs
Love don't care whose house it [C]lives in
I'm so [D7]glad that love lives here with you and [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I wish that I could offer more for [D7]you deserve the best
But all my life I've lived from one [C]payday to the [G]next
But sometimes I know I've got to be the [C]richest man on earth
There's no [D7]way that I can measure what you're loving me is [G]worth
