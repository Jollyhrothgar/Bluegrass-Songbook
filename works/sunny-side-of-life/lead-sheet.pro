{start_of_verse}
There’s a dark and a troubled side of life
There’s a bright and a sunny side, too
Though we meet with the darkness and strife
The sunny side we also may view.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Keep on the sunny side alwys on the sunny side
Keep on the sunny side of life
It will help us every day it will brighten all the way
If we keep on the sunny side of life.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus}
The storm and its fury broke today
Brushing hopes that we’ve cherished so dear
Cloud and storm will in time pass away
The sun again will shine bright and clear.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus}
Let us breathe with a song of hope each day
Though the moments be cloudy or fair
Let us trust in our Saviour away
He keepeth everyone in his care.
{end_of_chorus}
