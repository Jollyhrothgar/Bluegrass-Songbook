{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Jim [E]Blake your wife is dying
Went [A]over the [E]wires tonight
The [E]message was brought to the depot
By a [B7]lad all trembling with fright
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
He [E]entered the office crying
His [A]face was [E]terribly white
Send [E]this message to dad and his engine
Mother [B7]is dying [E]tonight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
In [E]something less than an hour
Jim’s [A]message back to [E]me flew
Tell [E]wife I’ll be there at midnight
I’m [B7]praying for her too
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I [E]left my son in the office
Took the [A]message to [E]Jim’s wife
There [E]I found the dying woman
Was [B7]scarce of breath [E]and life
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
O’er [E]hill and dale and valley
Thunders [A]the [E]heavy train
His [E]engine is sobbing and throbbing
And [B7]under a terrible strain
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
But [E]Jim hangs onto his throttle
Guiding [A]her [E]crazy flight
And [E]his voice cries out in the darkness
God [B7]speed the express [E]tonight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
I [E]telephoned the doctor
How [A]is Jim’s wife [E]I asked
About [E]the hour of midnight
Is [B7]long as she can last
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
In [E]something less than an hour
The [A]train will be [E]along
But [E]here I have a message
Oh [B7]god there is [E]something wrong
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 9}
The [E]message reads disaster
The [A]train is in [E]the ditch
The [E]engineer is dying
Derailed [B7]by an open switch
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 10}
And [E]there is another message
To [A]Jim’s wife it is [E]addressed
I’ll [E]meet you at midnight in heaven
Wait [B7]for the fast [E]express
{end_of_verse}
