{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Dear sweetheart as I write to you my heart is filled with pain
For [G]if those things I hear are true I’ll never see you again
They [G]tell me darlin’ that tonight you’ll wed another man
But [C]if you do I’ll tell you [G]true my boat will never land
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You [G]promised that you would wait for me that nothin’ could come between
That [G]in my arms someday you’d be my wife and lovely Queen
I built you that cozy home and made a garden there
And [C]planted too with my own hands [G]sweet flowers rich and fair
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
My [G]future hopes are placed in you you’ve been my guidin’ star
Please [G]write and tell me that you’re true to the sailor who waits afar
Just [G]tell me that you love me yet still long to be my wife
I’ll [C]return and then [G]we’ll wed and live a happy life
{end_of_verse}
