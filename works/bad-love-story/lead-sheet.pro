{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Once again you tried to show me what my eyes [F]refused to [C]see
In the [G7]lines between a painful scene we're [C]in  [G7]
With the [C]silence fallin' cold on a world of [F]make be[C]lieve
In the [G7]ending that I still don't under[C]stand
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
It's a [F]bad love story that I've [C]had to learn by heart
Cause I've [G7]lived these lines so many times [C]before
And it's a [F]shame the way the same old ending [C]still tears me apart
Where the [G7]lady still don't love me any[C]more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I can see the truth before me like a mirror [F]on the [C]wall
With a [G7]crack or two for every fool I've [C]been [G7]
And I [C]see the lady wait for her countdown [F]curtain [C]call
And it's [G7]lookin' like the place that I came [C]in
{end_of_verse}
