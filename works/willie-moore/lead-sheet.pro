{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Willie [D]Moore was a king [G]his age twenty-one
And [D]he courted a damsel fair
Oh her [G]eyes were as bright as the diamonds after night
And [G]wavy black was her hair
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
He [D]courted her [G]both night and day
Till on [D]marry they did agree
But [G]when he came to get her parents’ consent
They [G]said that could never be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
She [D]threw herself [G]in Willie Moore’s arms
As [D]oft time had done before
But [G]little did he think when they parted that night
Sweet [G]Anna he would see no more.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Oh [D]it was about [G]the tenth of May
The [D]time I remember well
That [G]very same night her body disappeared
In a [G]way no tongue could tell
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Sweet [D]Anna was loved [G]both far and near
Had [D]friends most all around
And [G]in a little brook before the cottage door
The [G]body of sweet Anna was found
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
She was [D]taken by [G]her weeping friends
And [D]carried to her parent’s room
And [G]there she was dressed in a shroud of snowy white
And [G]laid in a lonely tomb
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Her [D]parents now [G]are left alone
One [D]mourns while the other weeps
Beneath [G]a grassy mound before the cottage door
The [G]body of sweet Anna sleeps
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
Willie Moore scarcely spoke to his friends they say
And at last from them all he did part
And the last heard from him he was in Montreal
Where he died of a broken heart
{end_of_verse}
