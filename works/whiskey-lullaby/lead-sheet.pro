{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]She put him [G7]out like the [C]burning end of a midnight ciga[Em]rette
She broke his [G7]heart he [C]spent his whole life trying to [D7]forget
We [Em]watched him drink his [D7]pain away a [G7]little at a time
But he [Em]never could get [D7]drunk enough 
To [G7]get her off his mind until the [D7]night
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
He put that [G7]bottle to his head and pulled the [D7]trigger
And [Em]finally drank away her memo[C]ry
[G7]Life is short but this time it was [D7]bigger
Than the [Em]strength he had to get up off his [C]knees
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
We [G7]found him with his face down in the [D7]pillow
With a [Em]note that said I'll love her till I [C]die
And [G7]when we buried him beneath the [D7]willow
The [C]angels sang a whiskey lulla[Em]by

The rumors [G7]flew but no[C]body knew how much she blamed her[Em]self
For [D7]years and [G7]years she [C]tried to hide the whiskey on her [D7]breath
She [Em]finally drank her pain [D7]away a [G7]little at a time
But she [Em]never could get drunk [D7]enough 
To [G7]get him off her mind until the [D7]night
{end_of_verse}

While the [C]angels sang a whiskey lulla[Em]by
