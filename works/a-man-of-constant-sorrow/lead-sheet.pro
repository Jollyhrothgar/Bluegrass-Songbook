{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I [A]am [A]a man of [D]constant sorrow
I’ve seen [E7]trouble all [A]my days
I [A]bid [A]farewell to old [D]Kentucky
The place where [E7]I was born [A]and raised
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
For [A]six [A]long years I’ve been [D]in trouble
No pleasure [E7]here on [A]earth I find
For [A]in [A]this world I’m bound [D]to ramble
I have no [E7]friends to help [A]me now
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
It’s [A]fare thee [A]well my own [D]true lover
I never [E7]expect to see [A]you again
For I’m bound to ride that Northern railroad
Perhaps I’ll die upon this train
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
You can bury me in some deep valley
For many years where I may lay
Then [A]you may [A]learn to [D]love another
While I am sleeping in my grave
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
It’s fare [E7]you well to a native country
The places I have loved so well
For I have seen all kinds of trouble
In this cruel world no tongue can tell
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Maybe your friends think I’m a stranger
My face your’ll never see no more
But [A]there is one promise that is given
I’ll meet you on God’s golden shore
{end_of_verse}
