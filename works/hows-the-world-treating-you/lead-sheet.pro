{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I’ve [D]had nothing but sorrow
Since you said [A]we were through
There’s no hope for tomorrow
How’s the world [D]treating you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Every sweet thing that matters
Has been broken [G]in two
All my dreams have been [D]shattered
How’s the world [D]treating you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Got no plans for next Sunday
Got no plans [A]for today
Every day is blue Monday
Every day [D]you’re away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Tho’ our pathways have parted
To your  memory [G]I’m true
Guess I’ll stay [D]broken hearted
How’s the world [D]treating you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Do you wonder about me
Like I’m hoping [A]you do
Are you lonesome without me
Have you found someone [D]new
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Are you burning and yearning
Do you ever get [G]blue
Do you think of [D]returning
How’s the world [D]treating you
{end_of_verse}
