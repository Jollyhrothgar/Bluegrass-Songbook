{start_of_verse}
I’ve slipped around, dear, two-timing you
Having fun now, like some guys do
But now I’m sorry and now I’m true
Forgive me, darling, its up to you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Well I don’t blame you if you two-time, too
Because I’m guilty for the things I do
I’ve slipped around, love, played every game
And if you leave me I’ll take the blame
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
I ain’t got much money, I’m just a pauper guy
Trying to go on, dear without your love, I’ll die
So please don’t leave me, whatever you do
Just squeeze me, darling, while I’m loving you
{end_of_verse}
