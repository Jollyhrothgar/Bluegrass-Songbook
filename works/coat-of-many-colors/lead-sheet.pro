{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Back through the years I go wondering once again
Back to the seasons of my [C]youth
I recall a box of rags that [G]someone gave us
And how my momma put these rags to [C]use
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
There were rags of many colors and every piece was [G]small
And I didn't have a coat and it was way down in the [D7]fall
Momma [G]sewed the rags together sewing ever piece with [C]love
She made my [G]coat of many colors [D7]that I was so proud [G]of
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
As she sewed she told the story from the bible she had read
About a coat of many colors Joseph wore and then she [D7]said
Perhaps [G]this coat will bring you much love and [C]happiness
And I just couldn't wait to wear [G]it
And momma [D7]blessed it with a [G]kiss
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
My [C]coat of many colors that my momma made for [G]me
[C]Made only rags but I [G]wore it so [D7]proudly
[G]Although we had no money oh I was rich as I could [C]be
In my [G]coat of many colors [D7]my momma made for [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
So with patches on my breaches and holes in both my shoes
In my coat of many colors I hurried off to [D7]school
Just to find [G]the others laughing and making fun of [C]me
In my [G]coat of many colors [D7]my momma made for [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Oh I couldn't understand it for I felt I was rich
And I told them of the love my momma sewed in ever [D7]stitch
And I told [G]them all the story momma told me while she [C]sewed
And how my coat of many [G]colors
Is [D7]worth more than all of their [G]clothes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
They [C]didn't under stand it and I tried to make them [G]see
[C]That one is only poor [G]only if they choose to [D7]be
Now I know [G]we have no money but I'm as rich as I could [C]be
In my [G]coat of many colors [D7]my momma made for [G]me
{end_of_verse}
