{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I was hanging around town just spending my [G7]time
Out of a job not earning a [C]dime
A feller steps up and he said I [F]suppose 
[G7]You're a bronc fighter from looks of your [C]clothes
You figures me right I'm a good one I [G7]claim
Do you happen to have any bad ones to [C]tame
Said he's got one a bad one to [F]buck
At [G7]throwing good riders he's had lots of [C]luck
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I gets all het up and I ask what he [G7]pays
To ride this old nag for a couple of [C]days
He offered me ten I said I'm your [F]man
[G7]A bronc never lived that I couldn't [C]fan
He said get your saddle I'll give you a [G7]chance
In his buckboard we hopped and he drives to the [C]ranch
I stayed till morning and right after [F]chuck
I [G7]stepped out to see if this outlaw can [C]buck
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Down in the horse corral standing [G7]alone
Is an old Caballo a Strawberry [C]Roan
His legs are all spavined he's got pigeon [F]toes
[G7]Little pig eyes and a big Roman [C]nose
Little pin ears that touched at the [G7]tip
A big 44 brand was on his left [C]hip
U-necked and old with a long lower [F]jaw
I [G7]could see with one eye he's a regular [C]outlaw
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I gets the blinds on 'im and it sure is a [G7]fright
Next comes the saddle and I screws it down [C]tight
Then I steps on 'im and I raises the [F]blinds
[G7]Get outta the way boys he's gonna [C]unwind
He sure is a broad walker he heaves a big [G7]sigh
He only likes wings for to be on the [C]fly
He turns his old belly right up to the [F]sun
He [G7]sure is a sun-fishing [C]son-of-a-gun
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
He's about the worst bucker I've seen on the [G7]range
He'll turn on a nickel and give you some [C]change
He hits on all fours and goes up on [F]high
[G7]Leaves me a spinning up there in the [C]sky
I turns over twice and I comes back to [G7]earth
I lights in a cussing the day of his [C]birth
I know there are ponies that I cannot [F]ride
[G7]There's some of them left they haven't all [C]died
{end_of_verse}

I'll bet all my money the man ain't [G7]alive

That'll stay with Old Strawberry
When he makes his high [C]dive
{end_of_verse}
