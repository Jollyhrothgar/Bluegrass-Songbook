{start_of_chorus}
Plant [A]some flowers by [D]my graveside
Just [A]a little bunch [E]of them
Makes [A]no difference what [D]they are, dear
Since [A]your [E]hand has [A]planted them
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Darlin’, [A]when you pass [D]the graveside
You [A]see my name there on [E]a slab
Won’t [A]you stop a [D]little while dear
For [A]I [E]would be [A]lonesome there
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You [A]will do this won’t [D]you darlin’
You will do this last request
You [A]will do this won’t [D]you darlin’
When [A]they [E]lay me down [A]to rest
{end_of_verse}
