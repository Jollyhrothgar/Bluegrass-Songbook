Pardon [C]me if I’m [E7]sentimental [F]when we say [C]goodbye
Don’t be [C]angry with me [A]darling should I [D]cry[G]
When you’re [C]gone I’ll [E7]dream a [F]little dream as years [C]go by
Now and then there’s a fool such as I
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Now and [F]then there’s a [F]fool such [C]as I am over [C]you
You [G]thaught me how to [D]love and now [G]you say that we [G7]are thru
I’m a [C]fool but I [E7]love you dear [F]until the end of [C]time
Now and then there’s a fool such as I
