{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
If [E]I had [A]my way  [D]I’d leave here [A]today
I’d leave in a [E]hurry[Bm][E]
I’d find me a [A]place [D] where I [A]could stay
And not have to [E]worry[Bm][E]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
A place I could [A]use
A place I [D]could [C#m]lose [Bm]the [E]Tennessee [A]Blues
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus}
I’d [E]find me [A]a spot [D]on some mountain [A]top
With no one around [E]me[Bm7][E]
Valleys [A]and streams, [D]birds in [A]the trees
And hills that surround [E]me.[Bm][E]
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus}
I’d [E]try to [A]forget [D]all [A]my regrets
I’d keep just the good [E]times[Bm][E]
I’d wake and I’d [A]sleep, [D]nothing [A]but peace
Feel free all [E]the [Bm]time.[E]
{end_of_chorus}
