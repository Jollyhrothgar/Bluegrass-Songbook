{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I [G]have changed with changing seasons
I am [C]dimmed with toil [G]and care
When I [G]stand among the angels
Will [G]my mother know me there
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Yes I [C]know that she [G]will know me
In [G]those mansions bright [D]and fair
Mother’s [G]love can n’er forget me
And [G]I’m sure she’ll know me there
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
All for [G]me my mother wrestled
When [C]she used to kneel [G]in prayer
Do [G]you think we have forgotten
Will [G]my mother know me there
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Mothers [G]face has been a beckoned
O’er [C]the sea of deep [G]despair
I [G]shall look for her up yonder
Will [G]my mother know me there
{end_of_verse}
