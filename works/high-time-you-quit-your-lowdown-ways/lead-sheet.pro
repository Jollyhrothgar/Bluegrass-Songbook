[G]Well I'm sick and tired of [D7]waking up sick and [G]tired
As of today there's gonna be some changes [D7]made

Anything to the [D7]talk I hear over [G]town
Is it really true girl that you go on the deck up and [D7]down
Now the word as well as I can [G]recall
Everywhere you've been you've been the belle of [C]the ball
[G]It's high time you [D7]quit your lowdown [G]ways

I remember one time now [D7]way back down on the [G]farm
My daddy had a Dominaker hen but she wouldn't stay [D7]home
Well now she could fly higher than a jet [G]airplane
But not after Daddy clipped her little [C]ol' wings
[G]It's high time you [D7]quit your lowdown [G]ways
