{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I knew there were others [C]after you 
I [G]knew I had compe[D7]tition
But I [G]figured I was way out [C]in the front 
In the [G]number [D7]one po[G]sition
Then someone stole your [C]love from me 
[G]Like a thief so sly and [D7]cunning
Then I [G]realized that [C]all along 
I [G]wasn't even [D7]in the [G]running
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [C]thought the odds [D7]were all with me 
I [C]had a winning combi[G]nation
Then [Em]I received to [D7]my dismay 
Your [C]wedding invi[D7]tation
We [G]were sweethearts [C]for so long 
The [G]sudden loss was [D7]stunning
But [G]here's the catch coming [C]down the stretch 
I [G]wasn't even [D7]in the [G]running
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I was the favorite [C]for so long 
That [G]folks just took for [D7]granted
That [G]you and I would [C]tie the knot 
And in a [D7]love nest we'd be [G]planted
But there was a dark horse [C]in the race 
From [G]nowhere he came [D7]gunning
And the [G]way he won your [C]love from me 
I [G]wasn't even [D7]in the [G]running
