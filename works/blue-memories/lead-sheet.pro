{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]When I close my eyes I almost see
The [G7]way you looked when you were standing next to [C]me
And I still feel you holdin' me tight
Oh I can [D7]hear the laughter and [G7]all the words 
You whispered in the [C]night

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]Picture this and paint it blue 
A [C]photograph of me and you
The [F]smile has faded with the years 
[G7]Washed away by all the tears
And [F]when I look all I see are [G7]blue memo[C]ries
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Oh how I remember the time 
[G7]There was love in your heart and that love was [C]mine
If I could turn it all around again
[D7]We'd be lying side by side and [G7]things would be 
The way they were back [C]then
