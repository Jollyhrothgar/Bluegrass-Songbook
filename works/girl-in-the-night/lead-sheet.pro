{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]She lives her life in honky tonks and the crowded backstreet [C]bars
A [D7]world of make believe that knows no sun no moon or [G]stars
Just the glitter of the great white way and the glare of city [C]lights
Where the [D7]music’s loud she’s in the crowd a lonely girl in the [G]night
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [C]wonder if she’s thinking of dreams that didn’t [G]last
I [C]wonder if she’s haunted by [A7]heartaches from the [D7]past
[G]Perhaps there is a story of a love that wasn’t [C]right
Now the [D7]shadows hide her foolish pride a lonely girl in the [G]night
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
spoken:
I watch her sit there so lonely as she lights a [C]cigarette
And the smoke [D7]rings rise but in her eyes there seems to be such [G]regret 
Is she there to tempt a lover in that dress that hugs her [C]tight
With a [D7]glass of wine to pass the time a lonely girl in the [G]night
{end_of_verse}
