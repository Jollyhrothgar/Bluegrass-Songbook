{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Deep in the heart of the in[F]finite darkness
A [C]tiny blue marble is [D7]spinning through [G7]space
[C]Born in the splendor of [F]God's holy vision
And [C]sliding away like a [G7]tear down his [C]face
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The [F]closer you see the whole [C]wide holy wonder
Of oceans and mountains and [D7]rivers and [G7]trees
And the [C]strangest creation of [F]many the human
A [C]creature of laughter and [G7]Freedom and [C]dreams
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now the warriors are waving [F]their old rusty sabres
[C]And preachers are preaching [D7]the gospel of [G7]hate
[C]By their behavior they're [F]determined to teach us
A [C]lesson we're soon to be [G7]learning too l[C]ate
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Look [F]closer my brother we're [C]killing each other
And we'd better stop and get [D7]started to[G7]day
Because [C]life is the question and [F]life is the answer
And [C]God is the reason and [G7]love is the [C]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Because life is the question and [F]life is the answer
And [C]God is the reason and [G7]love is the [C]way
{end_of_verse}
