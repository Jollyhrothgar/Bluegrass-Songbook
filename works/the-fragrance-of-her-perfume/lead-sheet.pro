{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]There she goes [G7]she slowly walks [C]away
With her [D7]head held in that old familiar [G]way
Here I stand [G7]there's a teardrop in my [C]eyes
While the [D7]fragrance of her perfume starts to [G]die
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Here I stand [G7]I'm a loser once [C]again
It [D7]seems to me that things have been [G]unkind
And there she goes [G7]she didn't even say [C]goodbye
Now the [D7]fragrance of her perfume starts to [G]die
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I know my thoughts [G7]of her will linger [C]on
Her [D7]memory will haunt me night and [G]day
Why can't her love [G7]that had to come my [C]way
Be [D7]like her perfume just fade [G]away
Be [D7]like her perfume and fade [G]away
{end_of_verse}
