{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Once [C]my soul was astray from [G7]the [C]heavenly way
I was wretched and [G7]blind as [C]could be
But my Savior in love [F]gave me peace [C]from above
When he reached down [G7]his hand [C]for me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
When the Savior reached down [G7]for me
When he reached down [G7]his hand [C]for me
I [C]was lost and [F]undone without God or [C]his Son
When he reached down [G7]his hand [C]for me
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
How my heart does rejoice when I hear his sweet voice
In a tempest to him I can cling
I can lean on his arm safe and sure from all harm
When he reaches down [G7]his hand [C]for me
{end_of_verse}
