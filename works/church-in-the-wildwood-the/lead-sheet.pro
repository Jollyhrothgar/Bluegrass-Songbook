{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
There’s [C]a church in the valley by the [G7]wildwood
No [G7]lovelier place in [C]the dale
No [F]spot is so dear to [C]my childhood
As the [G7]little brown church in [C]the dell
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Oh, [C]come to the church by the [G7]wildwood
Oh, [G7]come to the church in [C]the dale
No [F]spot is so dear to [C]my childhood
As the [G7]little brown church in [C]the dell
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
How [C]sweet on a clear Sabbath [G7]morning
To [G7]list to the clear [C]ringing bell
It’s [F]tones so sweetly [C]are calling
Oh, [G7]come to the church in [C]the dell
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
There, [G7]close by the church in [C]the valley
Lies one that I love so well
She [F]sleeps, sweetly sleeps, neath [C]the willow
Disturb [G]not her rest in [C]the dell
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
There, [C]close by the side of that [G7]loved one
Neath the [G7]tree where the wild [C]flowers bloom
When the farewell hymn shall be chanted
I shall rest by her side in the tomb
{end_of_verse}
