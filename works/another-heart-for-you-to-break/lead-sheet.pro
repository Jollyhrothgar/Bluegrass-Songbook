[C]I [G7]wish I [C]had another heart for you [C7]to [F]break
[C]For my heart's out of [F]style and hurt so much [G7]that I can't [C]smile
[G7]I may be [C]a fool that's not my first or [C7]last [F]mistake
[C]And I wish I had [G7]another heart for you to [C]break
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C7]When your love for me died you left that an empty shell [F]inside
[D7]An endless memory where my heart used to [G7]be
[C]You may hurt me again but that's the chance [C7]I'll gladly [F]take
[C]I wish I had another [G7]heart for you to [C]break
[F]I wish I [C]had another [G7]heart for you to [C][F]break
{end_of_verse}
