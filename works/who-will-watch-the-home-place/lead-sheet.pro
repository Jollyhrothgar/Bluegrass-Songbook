{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Leaves [G]are falling and turning to showers of gold
As [G]the postman climbs up our [D]long hill
And there’s [G]sympathy written all over [C]his face
As he [Am]hands me a couple [D]more bills
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Who will watch the home place
Who [C]will [G]tend [C]my hearts [D]dear space
Who [G]will [C]fill [G]my [C]empty place
When [G]I [D]am gone [G]from here
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
There’s [G]a lovely green nook by [C]a [G]clear-running stream
It [G]was my place when I was quite [D]small
And it’s [G]creatures and sounds could soothe my [C]worst pains
But [Am]today they don’t ease me [D]at all
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
In [G]my grandfather’s shed there are [C]hundreds [G]of tools
I [G]know them by feel and [D]by name
And like [G]parts of my body they’ve patched this [C]old place
When I [Am]move them they won’t be [D]the same
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Now [G]I wander around [C]touching each [G]blessed thing
The [G]chimney the tables the [D]trees
And my [G]memories swirl ’round me like birds on [C]the wing
When I leave here oh who will [D]I be
{end_of_verse}
