[C]You left me with the hurt that grows with [G7]each new day

Each day brings more grieve and pain and [G7]misery
From your love I know I'll never [C]be set free

It seems that nothing's been the same since [G7]you're not here
The things that once brought laughter now they're [C]only tears
This old heart feels like it's gonna [F]break in two
I've [C]let you intro[F]duce me [G7]to the [C]blues
