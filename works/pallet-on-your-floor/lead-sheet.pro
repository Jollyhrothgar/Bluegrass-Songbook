{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Make [F]me a pallet on [C]your [C7]floor
Make [F]me a pallet on [C]your [C7]floor
When I reach Atlanta and got no place to go
Make [F]me a pallet on [C]your [C7]floor
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
These blues are every where I see
weary blues are every where I see
Blues are all around me every where I see
Nobody’s had these blues as bad as me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Come on all you good time friends of mine
Ooh Come on all you good time friends of mine
When I had a dollar you treated me so fine
Where’d you go when I only have a dime
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I’d be more than satisfied
To hop on a old freight train and ride
But when I reach Atlanta and got no place to go
Won’t [F]you make me a pallet on [C]your [C7]floor
{end_of_verse}
