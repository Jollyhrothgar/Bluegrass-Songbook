[G]I'm always second choice I'm never first with [C]you
Oh [D7]how it hurts to see you out with someone [G]new

Just when I think I'm number one I find I'm number [C]two
I [D7]feel the pain and hide the hurt that I go [G]through
I live on dreams my precious dreams that never will come [C]true
How [D7]long will I be second choice and love you like I [G]do

Though second choice is hard to take I'll never change [C]sweetheart

I'll swallow pride and lock inside the heartaches that I [C]feel
How [D7]long will I be second choice with the love so [G]real
