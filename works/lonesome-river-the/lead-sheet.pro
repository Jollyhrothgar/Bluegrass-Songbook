{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I [A]sit here alone on the banks of the river
The lonesome [D]wind blows the water [A]rolls high
I hear a voice [D]calling out there in the [A]darkness
I sit here [E]alone too lonesome to [A]cry
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Oh [A]the water rolls high on the river at midnight
I sit on the shore to grieve and to cry
The woman I love she left me this morning
With no one to [E]love or kiss me [A]goodnight
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
We met there one night by the banks of the river
Sat there holding hands and making our vows
Swore we’d never part and be happy together
But a new love she’s found she’s gone from me now
{end_of_verse}
