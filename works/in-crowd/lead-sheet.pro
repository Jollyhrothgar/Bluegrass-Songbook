And I leave my worries far behind 
And [D7]wonder what the in crowd might be [G]doing

Farther down the road a pretty [C]woman's waitin' with a drink [G]for me
There's a lot of woman there [C]pretty soon that's where I'm gonna [D7]be
[C]I'm the only one that's missing I'm the one the in crowd's waitin' [G]for
As I drive around the back and leave the [D7]car and I open up the [G]door
