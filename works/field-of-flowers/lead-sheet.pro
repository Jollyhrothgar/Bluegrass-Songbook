And she put all the flowers to shame
[D7]Roses the poppies the [G]violets the daisy's 
Will [A7]never again be the [D7]same

Are just [D7]what I need near my [G]heart 
{end_of_verse}

But [C]then I went wondering
But I miss her more and more every [G]day
And [A7]while I was wondering 
Her heart was breaking and she was pinning [D7]away
{end_of_verse}

As she [G]lies in that field of flowers
Her smile I will never more see
[D7]Roses the poppies the [G]violets the daisy's
Have [D7]taken my baby from [G]me
