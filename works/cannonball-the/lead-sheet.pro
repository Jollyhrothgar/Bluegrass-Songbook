{start_of_verse}
You can wash my jumper starch my overalls
Catch that train they call the Cannonball
From Buffalo to Washington
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Yonder comes the train coming down the track
Carrying me away but it aint gonna carry me back
My honey babe my blue eyed babe
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
My baby left me she even took my shoes
Enough to give me the doggone worried blues
She’s gone she’s solid gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I’m going up north I’m going up north this fall
If my luck don’t change I wont be back at all
My honey babe I’m leaving you
{end_of_verse}
