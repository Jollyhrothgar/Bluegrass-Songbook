{start_of_verse}
Friends tell me that told you wed another
They say you look so happy all the time
I just can’t realize that I have lost you
Somehow I thought you always would be mine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I’ve love you since the day that I first met you
I thought no one could ever come between
Those promises you made have all been broken
And all I have to live for now is grief
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Somehow I can’t believe that you’ll be happy
With memories to haunt you night and day
But only time can make you learn your lesson
I’m sure you think you’ve reached your goal today
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I never thought someday that I would lose you
You’re just the kind that never could be true
You only wanted me just for a while dear
Just long enough to break my heart in two
{end_of_verse}
