{start_of_verse}
I remember very well on one dark and dreary day
Just as I was leaving home for a distant land to roam
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Mother said (mother said) my dear boy (my dear boy)
I hope to see you next year again
Fare you well (fare you well) fare you well (fare you well)
So I left my dear old home for a distant land to roam
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
Now I wandered far away from my home I’ve gone astray
Now I’m coming coming home never more from thee to roam
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
And these words she said to me as she took me by the hand
If on earth we meet no more may we meet at God’s right hand
{end_of_verse}
