{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Baby I couldn't [F]hide no matter how hard I [C]tried
Was foolish to have [G7]begun to believe I'd ever out[C]run
And honey I had no [F]call to try and escape at [C]all

{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Baby I used to have [F]ways to avoid any[C]place
That even had half the [G7]chance to cut in on my [C]dance

But showed up permanently [G7]when love caught up to [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[E7]The fascinations of each [F]lie 
[E7]I told myself were reasons [F]why

[G]Sound faded worn and all out[G7]grown
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]Hey I could never [F]afford honey all it would [C]cost
To replace what you [G7]do if it ever got [C]lost
But baby I'd beg and [F]steal just to keep how I [C]feel
A way I never did need [G7]till love caught up to [C]me
