{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Don't you dare put a quarter in the [D7]jukebox 
If you don't intend to play a country [G]song 
When you punch those buttons just make sure it's [D7]Merle or Moe or Willie 
Some[C]one that I can [D7]cry with all night [G]long 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
It's [C]not that I don't like the jazz on [G]Bourbon Street 
And [C]it's not that I don't care for rock and [D7]roll 
But [G]tonight I'm in the mood for country [D7]music 
Just a [C]heart breaking [D7]three chord country [G]song
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
No other kind of music tells a [D7]story 
Like Lonesome 7720[G]3 
And The Keys In The Mailbox paints a [D7]picture in my mind 
Cause [C]I keep hoping [D7]she'll come back to [G]me
