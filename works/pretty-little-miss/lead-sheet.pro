{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Pretty little [C]miss out in the [G]garden
Strange young man came riding [C]by
Down at the [C]gate he did [G]address her
Saying pretty little [G]miss won’t you [C]marry me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh no my love is on the ocean
Seven years out on the sea
And if he sails seven years longer
No man on earth can marry me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Perhaps your loved one he is drowned
Perhaps he’s in some battle land
Perhaps he stole some girl and married
You’ll never see your love again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
If he is drowned I hope he’s happy
Or if he’s in some battle land
Or if he stole some girl and married
I’ll love the girl that married him
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
He pulled his hand out of his pockets
His fingers being keen and small
This is the ring you placed upon here
Down by his feet she did fall
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
He picked her up in arms so tender
Kisses he gave her one two three
This is your little single soldier
Returning home to marry thee
{end_of_verse}
