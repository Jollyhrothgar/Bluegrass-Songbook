{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
A [Bb]house not a home was the picture Satan painted
For [Eb]sweet little sister [Bb]and me
Our daddy would frown while mother was praying
His heart was so hardened that [F]he would [Bb]not believe
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
In anger he’d [Bb7]swear [Eb]his voice [Bb]cold and loud
His [Bb]Sundays were spent out with the [F]gambling crowd
I’ve [Bb]never seen my [Eb]daddy inside a [Bb]house of God
For Satan held his hand down the [F]path of sin [Bb]he trod
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Not [Bb]long ago our circle was broken
When [Eb]God called on mother [Bb]one night
In [Bb]a voice sweet and low her last words were spoken
Asking our daddy to [F]raise her [Bb]children right
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
The [Bb7]angels rejoiced [Eb]in heaven [Bb]last night
I [Bb]heard my daddy praying til God made [F]it right
He [Bb]was smiling and singing [Eb]with tears in [Bb]his eyes
While [Bb]mother with the angels [F]rejoiced [Bb]last night
{end_of_verse}
