{start_of_verse}
When first unto this land I came
She was a virgin paradise
The truth was there for all to see
No falsehood and no lies.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
She was overflowing
With everything we need
We took so much we never saw
The forest for the trees.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
This land she is my lover
She fills me with desire
Seasons come and seasons go
Earth water wind and fire.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I cleared this land with my bare hands
She gave me everything so free
She gave so much I couldn’t see
The forest for the trees.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I’m an addict with a habit
I’m kept so well supplied
With all my greed and hope and love and fear
1 can’t be satisifed.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I took my young son up on a clear cut mountain
I fell down on my knees
I prayed that he would someday see the forest for the trees
I pray that we might someday see the forest for the trees.
{end_of_verse}
