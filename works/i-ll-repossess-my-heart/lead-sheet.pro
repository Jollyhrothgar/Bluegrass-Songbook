{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I'm walking in to repossess my [C]heart
Just [D7]can't believe you treated me this [G]way
You've had it much too long now [C]all our love is gone
I'll [D7]repossess my heart and love [G]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I still [C]dream of you each [D7]night and [C]long to hold you [G]tight
And [A7]I can't even get you off my [D7]mind
True [G]love is hard to find and you [C]never wanted mine
I'll [D7]repossess my heart and love [G]again
