{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I [G]once had a dark haired true lover
She was [D]all this world [G]to me
She [C]promised herself to [G]another
Now [D]don’t you think this [G]was mean
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Take [G]back every word you have spoken
Let it [D]be as though we [G]never met
For [C]tonight I’m a poor boy [G]heartbroken
I’ll [D]forgive but I’ll never [G]forget
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [G]was young when I wrote my first letter
I [D]blotted the lines [G]with tears
But [C]now I am old I [G]know better
We [D]parted for many [G]long years
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Oh Ruth, Oh Ruth how I love you
You just seem to me like a bird
Although you went back on your promise
Although you went back on your word
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
We [G]parted in the month of September
Some [D]said we parted [G]for life
But I [C]hope someday or [G]another
I’ll [D]call you my sweet [G]darling wife
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I [G]wish I had someone to love me
Someone [D]to call me [G]their own
For I’m [C]out in this wide world [G]a wandering
I’m [D]tired of living [G]alone
{end_of_verse}
