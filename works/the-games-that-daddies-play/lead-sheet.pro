{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]He put his arms around her shoulder and with a voice that sounded older
He said mom I got something on my [G7]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I don't wanna bother you but I sure need to talk to you
If you can only spare the [C]time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And Mom I hope you understand how much I love and need you
And I [C7]don't want you to take this the wrong [F]way
But [C]don't you think I'm old enough and big enough and strong [G7]enough
To play the games that daddies [C]play
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
My friend Billy Parker's dad came by today to see me
And he wondered if I'd like to [G7]go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
With him and Billy on a hike and maybe camp out overnight
The way I've seen 'em do in picture [C]shows
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
And there's one thing I'd like to do and maybe if I ask him to
He'd [C7]sit and talk with me man to [F]man
We'd only [C]be gone overnight and I could find out what it's [G7]like 
To play the games that Daddies [C]play
{end_of_verse}

She quickly turned to hide the tears from her son of seven years
He didn't know she'd read between the [G7]lines
{end_of_verse}

He'd never really known his dad and although he'd never ask
She knew exactly what was on his [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 9}
She searched her mind in desperation six long years of separation
[C7]Dimmed the words she knew she had to [F]say
I hope you're never big enough or old [C]enough or bold enough
To [G7]play the games that daddies [C]play
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 10}
I know you need and want his [G7]love but son you're the victim of
Another kind of game that daddies [C]play
{end_of_verse}
