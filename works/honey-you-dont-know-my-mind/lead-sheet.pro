{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Honey [G]you don’t know my mind I’m lonesome all [C]the time
Born to [D7]lose a drifter [G]that’s me
You can travel for so long then a rambler’s heart goes [C]wrong
Baby [D7]you don’t know my [G]mind today
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Heard the music of a rail slept in every old dirty [C]jail
And [D7]life’s too short for you to [G]worry me
When I find I can’t win I’ll be checking out [C]again
Baby [D7]you don’t know my [G]mind today
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I’ve been a hobo and a tramp my soul has done [C]been stamped
Lord [D7]things I know I learned the hard [G]hard way
I ain’t here to judge or plea but to give my poor heart ease
Baby [D7]you don’t know my [G]mind today
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Honey [G]you don’t know my mind I’m lonesome all [C]the time
Born to [D7]lose a drifter [G]that’s me
You say I’m sweet and kind I can love you a [C]thousand times
Baby [D7]you don’t know my [G]mind today
{end_of_verse}
