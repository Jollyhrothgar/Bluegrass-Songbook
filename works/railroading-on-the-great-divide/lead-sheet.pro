Nineteen [G]and sixteen [C]I started [G]to roam
Out [G]in the West no money no [D]home[Dsus4]

I [G]landed on the [C]Great [G]Divide

Railroading [G]on [C]the [G]Great Divide,
Nothing [G]around me but Rockies and [D]sky[Dsus4]
There [G]you’ll find me [C]as years [G]go by
Railroading [G]on [C]the [G]Great Divide

Ask [G]any old-timer from [C]Old [G]Cheyenne,
Railroad [G]in Wyoming the [G]best [Gsus2]in [G]the [D]land[Dsus4][D]
The [G]long steel rails, [C]the short [G]cross ties
I [G]laid across the [C]Great [G]Divide.

As [G]I looked [C]out across [G]the breeze
Number [G]Three coming, the [G]fastest [Gsus2]on [G]wheels[D][Dsus4][D]
Through old Laramie (Lamar) she glides with pride
And [G]rolls across [C]the [G]Great Divide
{end_of_verse}
