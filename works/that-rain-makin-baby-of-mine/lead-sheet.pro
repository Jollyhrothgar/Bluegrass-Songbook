[C]I've been leaning on the wine
To [F]keep my truthful mind from [C]falling
I've been trying to relieve the [F]broken heart

But I'm [C]still not strong enough
To [F]resist the haunting memories
That [C]keeps calling
Has anybody seen that [G7]rain making baby of [C]mine

[G7]I should have known by now
That all she ever brings is [C]rainy weather
And I [F]know that she'll abuse my [C]love for her

But the [C]rain can't stop a fool
Who's [F]been swimming back and forth [C]across the river
Has anybody seen that [G7]rain making baby of [C]mine
