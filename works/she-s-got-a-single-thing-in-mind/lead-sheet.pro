{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]She can't find the words to break [Am]it to me
Cause she always [F]was the gentle [C]kind
She's hoping I'll hear it from a [Am]friend somewhere
She's hoping I'll [F]read between the [C]lines
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[Am]But it comes as no sur[G7]prise
Cause she [Am]told me with her [G7]eyes
So watch her [C]untie the ties that [Am]bind
She's got a [F]single thing in [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
She's already gone except in [Am]body
It's just a [F]matter now of [C]time
But I should have seen the storm clouds [Am]gathering
But he who won't [F]look is just as [C]blind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
So there's [Am]only me to [G7]blame
When my [Am]woman drops my [G7]name
So watch her [C]untie the ties that [Am]bind
She's got a [F]single thing in [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
So watch her [C]untie the ties that [Am]bind
She's got a [F]single thing in [C]mind
{end_of_verse}
