{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]As you sit there in your [F]loneliness  [C]confused as you must [G7]be
[F]I'm sure a dozen [C]questions come to [G7]mind
[C]And if you're wondering [F]why I left [C]you  after all you've done for [G7]me
[F]I guess you'll have to [G7]blame it on the [C]times
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]The many times you had your way no matter what the [C]cost
[F]And the many times you took for granted [C]love you now have [G7]lost
[C]And if I've hurt [F]you darling  I don't [C]mean to be [G7]unkind
[F]I guess you'll have to [G7]blame it on the [C]times
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]That small conceited world [C]of yours  could never [G7]understand
[F]That to want to stand [C]alone is not a [G7]crime
[C]And if for one time [F]in my life  [C]I'm acting like a [G7]man
[F]I guess you'll have to [G7]blame it on the [C]times
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[F]Blame it on the many times a hiding place I'd [C]seek
[F]Afraid to say what's on my mind and [C]ashamed for being [G7]weak
[C]So if at last [F]I'm seeing  [C]after so long being [G7]blind
[F]I suppose you'll have to [G7]blame it on the [C]times
{end_of_verse}
