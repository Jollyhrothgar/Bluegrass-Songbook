{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Deep in my [Em]Christmas [C]memor[D7]ies
[G]Is the angel that [Em]flew to the [C]top of our [D7]tree
She [Am]guarded the [C]presents that [D7]lay beneath
And when [Am]no one was [G]lookin' she [D7]smiled down at me
I [G]stared up in [C]wonder at [G]her tender [D7]eyes
I [G]wanted to [C]touch her but [G]she was too [D7]high
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G]An[Em]gel my [D7]ang[Bm]el [C]dream that I [D7]wish would come [Bm]tru[Em]e
[C]All I [D7]ever [Bm]wanted [C]was an [G]ang[D7]el like [G]you[Em]   [C]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[D7]Now the [G]years they will [Em]make a [C]boy a [D7]man
But there [G]still are some [Em]mysteries I [C]don't under[D7]stand
How the [Am]moment we [C]met I knew [D7]you would be mine
I [Am]felt like I'd [G]known you a [D7]long long time
It was [G]just around [C]Christmas and [G]I felt [D7]alone
I [G]looked in your [C]eyes and I [G]knew I'd come [D7]home

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[D7]Now we [G]tucked our [Em]angels [C]in up[D7]stairs
And [G]heard them [Em]say their [C]Christmas [D7]prayers
We [Am]put all their [C]presents under the [D7]tree
As I [Am]reached for your [G]hand do you [D7]see what I see
That [G]shiny old [C]angel is [G]smiling at [D7]you
Like [G]this was the [C]secret that [G]she always [D7]knew
