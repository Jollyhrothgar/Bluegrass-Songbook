{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
All [C]my life I’ve wondered [F]if what I done [C]was wrong
All [C]I ever cared to do [G7]was ride my pony on
I [C]never had no [C7]heartache [F]was always happy [C]and gay
Until [C]I met a Texas girl [G7]who stole my [C]heart away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Where [C]the sleepy Rio Grande [F]goes slowly to [C]the sea
It was [C]there she promised to be mine [G7]throughout eternity
But the [C]angels they grew [C7]jealous of [F]her beauty and [C]her smile
And [C]came along one stormy night [G7]and stole away [C]my bride
The [C]birds have hushed their [C7]singing [F]sadness is over [C]the land
The [C]birds miss my darling by [G7]the sleepy [C]Rio Grande
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Her [C]lips were like the Russian wine [F]her hair it hung [C]in curls
Her [C]cheeks were like the dawn of day [G7]that breaks upon the world
She’s [C]gone and left me [C7]lonely I [F]miss the touch of [C]her hand
Tonight [C]while I am walking by the [G7]sleepy [C]Rio Grande
{end_of_verse}
