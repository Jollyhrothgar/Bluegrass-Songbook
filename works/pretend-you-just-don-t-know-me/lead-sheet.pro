{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]The next time that you see me please don't even [C]speak
I don't even want you [D7]walking down the same side of the [G]street
That's what she said the day she left and walked away from [C]me
Pretend you just don't [G]know me if we [D7]ever chance to [G]meet
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But [C]she knows I couldn't cause she [G]takes along my heart
And [A7]if we ever meet again I'll [D7]beg for another start
[G]I didn't mean to cheat on her but I cheated just the [C]same
To pretend I just don't [G]know her is like [D7]forgetting my own [G]name
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
What she said the day she left and walked away from [C]me
Pretend you just don't [G]know me if we [D7]ever chance to [G]meet
But [C]she knows I couldn't cause she [G]takes along my heart
And [A7]if we ever meet again I'll [D7]beg for another start
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[G]I didn't mean to cheat on her but I cheated just the [C]same
