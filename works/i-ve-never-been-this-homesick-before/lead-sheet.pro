And the table's set in splendor

So I [C]must be near for[F]ever
Lord I've [C]never been this [G7]homesick be[C]fore

See the bright light shine
It's just about [F]home time
I can [C]see my Father standing by the [G7]door
This world has [C]been a wilderness
I'm ready for [F]deliverance

I can see the family gather
Sweet faces there all familiar
But [F]no one's old or feeble any[C]more

Think I'll [C]spread my wings for [F]flyin'
Lord I've [C]never been this [G7]homesick be[C]fore
