{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]When our love was [C7]young it was [F]honest and true
Like [G7]livin’ in a fairytale [C]world [G7]
A [C]prince and a [C7]princess in a [F]dream made for two
Never [G7]dreaming that our love could [C]fail [G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
When the [C]walls of a [C7]dream world starts [F]shaking they’ll fall
Leaving [G7]pieces of nothing [C]behind [G7]
And it’s [C]easy to [C7]see that it’s [F]over 
Cause you’ve got that [G7]I’m leavin’ look in your [C]eyes [G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I [C]suppose we’re both [C7]lookin’ for [F]someone to blame
The [G7]truth is that it’s nobody’s [C]fault [G7]
Now [C]there’s no way of [C7]knowing what [F]happened to us
We [G7]just slowly drifted [C]apart [G7]
