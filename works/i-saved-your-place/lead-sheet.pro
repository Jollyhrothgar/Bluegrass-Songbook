{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Each night I fluff your pillow [G7]up beside [C]me
Lay out your favorite gown all [G7]trimmed with [C]lace
It may not cross your [G7]mind to wonder [C]how things are [F]without you
But [G7]if it ever does I saved your [C]place
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I hold on to [G7]how you used to [C]touch me
When I close my [G7]eyes I see your [C]face
It breaks my heart that [G7]someone else [C]could make you feel more [F]wanted
But [G7]if he lets you down I saved your [C]place
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G7]There may come a time when this is [F]all just some old [C]memory
But [D7]time's not movin' very fast these [G7]days
[C]With all you've got you [G7]may not need a [C]fool who really [F]loves you
But [G7]if you ever do I saved your [C]place
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
When he's holding you you [G7]may not need a [C]fool who really [F]loves you
But [G7]if you ever do I saved your [C]place
But [G7]if you ever do I saved your [C]place
{end_of_verse}
