She [C]moves along like a cannonball
Like a [F]star in it’s [C]heavenly flight

As [C]she [G]travels through [C]the night
{end_of_chorus}

I [C]can see a smile on the engineer’s face
And [F]although he’s old [C]and gray
A [C]contented [F]heart [C]the waits for [Am]his call
On the [C]streamline [G]cannonball[C]
