{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]There's a reason for the sunshiny sky
There's a reason why I'm feeling so high
Must be the [G7]season when those love lights shine all [C]around us
So let that feeling grab you deep inside
And send you reeling where your love can't hide
And then go [G7]stealing through the moonlit night with your [C]lover
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Just let your [F]love flow like a mountain stream
And let your [C]love grow with the smallest of dreams
And let your [G7]love show and you'll know what I mean it's the [C]season
Let your [F]love fly like a bird on the wind
And let your [C]love find you to all living things
And let your [G7]love shine and you'll know what I mean that's the [C]reason
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
There's a reason for the warm sweet nights
And there's a reason for the candle lights
Must be the [G7]season when those love lights shine all [C]around us
So let that wonder take you into space
And lay you under its loving embrace
Just feel the [G7]thunder as it warms your face you can't hold [C]back
{end_of_verse}
