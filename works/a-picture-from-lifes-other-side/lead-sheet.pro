Then there's [D7]pictures of peace and of [G7]strife
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
There hang [C]pictures of youth and of beauty
Of old [F]age and the blushing young [C]bride
They all [F]hang on the wall but the [C]saddest of all
Are the [G7]pictures from life's other [C]side
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Just a picture from life's other side
Some[F]one has fell by the [C]way 
A life has gone out with the tide
That [D7]might have been happy some [G7]day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
There's a [C]poor old mother at home
She's [F]watching and waiting a[C]lone

{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}

That she [D7]wore long ago on her wedding [G7]day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
It's his [C]last earthly treasure but he stakes it
Then he [F]bows his head that his shame he may [C]hide
But when [F]they lifted his head they [C]found he was dead
That's just a [G7]picture from life's other [C]side
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Now the last scene is that by the river
Of a [F]heartbroken mother and [C]babe
As the harbor lights shine and they shiver
On an [D7]outcast whom no one will [G7]save
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
And yet [C]she was once a true woman
She was [F]somebody's darling and [C]pride
God [F]help her she leaps for there's no [C]one to weep
It's just a [G7]picture from life's other [C]side
{end_of_verse}
