{start_of_verse}
Jesus come and hold my hand
While I walk this rocky road
Travellin’ to a better land
Where my friends will meet me I know
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Oh I’ll soon (yes I’ll soon) be on my way (be on my way)
Seems every time (seems every time) I kneel to pray
I hear my friends a’callin me
In the home above (in the home above) happy I’ll be
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
I’m so tired and all alone
But I must keep travellin’ on
I‘ll keep goin’ until I die
I’ll meet my friends (I’ll meet my friends) up there on high
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
When I reach that home on high
And bid my troubles on earth goodbye
I’ll be glad this life is o’er
This rocky road (this rocky road) I’ll walk no more
{end_of_verse}
