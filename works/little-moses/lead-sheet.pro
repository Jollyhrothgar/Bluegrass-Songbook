{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Away by the [E]waters [A]so blue
The ladies were [E]winding [A]their way
While [E]Pharaoh’s little daughter went down to the water
To [A]bathe in [E]the cool of [A]the day
Before [A]it was dark she opened the ark
And [E]found the sweet babe that [A]was there
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And away by the [E]waters [A]so blue
The infant was [E]lonely [A]and sad
She [E]took him in pity and thought him so pretty
And it [A]made [E]little Moses [A]so glad
She [A]called him her own, her beautiful son
And she [E]sent for a nurse who [A]was near
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And away by the [E]waters [A]so blue
They carried that [E]beautiful [A]child
To [E]his tender mother, to his sister and brothers
Little [A]Moses [E]looked happy [A]and smiled
His [A]mother so good did all that she could
To [E]raise him and teach him [A]with care
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
And away by the [E]sea that [A]was red
Little Moses the [E]servant [A]of God
While [E]in him confided, the sea was divided
As [A]upwards [E]he lifted [A]his rod
And [A]the Jews safely crossed while Pharaoh’s host
Was [E]drownded in the waters [A]and lost
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
And away on a [E]mountain [A]so high
The last that [E]he ever [A]did see
With [E]Israel victorious, his hopes were most glorious
That [A]soon all [E]the Jordan [A]be free
When [A]his spirit did cease, he departed in peace
And [E]rested in the Heavens [A]above
{end_of_verse}
