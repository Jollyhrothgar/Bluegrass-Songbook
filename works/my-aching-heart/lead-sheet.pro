{start_of_verse}
In time my aching heart will mend
Through all the sorrow that I’m in
And then I’ll see the light sweetheart
For someone new will take your place
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
So I’ll stand up and be brave
I’ll grieve each minute of the way
And on the day my tears will dry
I’ll forget I’ve ever lived this life
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
I’ve paid the price for loving you
And lived in dreams that could not be
I never thought it’d end this way
But I will smile again someday
{end_of_verse}
