{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I [D]just found out today the little game you play
I’ve been sleeping all my life away
You’ve [D]been stepping so they say between midnight and day
So I’m gonna sleep with one eye open from now on
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
From [G]now on (from now on) [D]all night long (all night long)
You won’t have a chance to treat your daddy wrong
You’ve [D]been stepping so they say between midnight and day
So I’m gonna sleep with one eye open from now on
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
There’s [D]honky tonk down the road just a mile or so
I understand that’s where you spend your time
Baby [D]I got news for you your little game is through
From now on baby you’re gonna toe the line
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
You [D]thought you were being wise running around with other guys
And leaving me to spend my time alone
But [D]you’ll find out today it don’t work out that way
You started a little game that two can play
{end_of_verse}
