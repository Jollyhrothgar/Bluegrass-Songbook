{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Along came the F15 the [D]swiftest on [A]the line
Running o’er the C&O road just [E]twenty minutes behind
Running [A]into Cevile [D]head porters on [A]the line
Receiving their strict orders from a [E]station just [A]behind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Georgie’s mother came to him with a [D]bucket on [A]her arm
Saying my darling son be [E]careful how you run
For [A]many a man has lost his life [D]in trying to make [A]lost time
And if you run your engine right you’ll [E]get there just [A]on time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Up the road he darted [D]against the rocks [A]he crushed
Upside down the engine turned and [E]Georgie’s breast did smash
His [A]head was against the firebox door [D]the flames are [A]rolling high
I’m glad I was born for an engineer to [E]die on the [A]C&O road
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
The doctor said to Georgie my [D]darling boy [A]be still
Your life may yet be saved if it [E]is God’s blessed will
Oh [A]no said George that will not do [D]I want to die [A]so free
I want to die for the engine I love one [E]hundred and [A]forty three
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
The doctor said to Georgie your [D]life cannot [A]be saved
Murdered upon a railroad and [E]laid in a lonesome grave
His [A]face was covered up with blood [D]his eyes they could [A]not see
And the very last words poor Georgie said was [E]nearer my God [A]to thee
{end_of_verse}
