{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
It [D]was on one dark and starless night
I [D]heard [G]and saw an [D]awful sight
The [D]lighting [G]flashed and the [D]thunder roared
All [D]around [A]the [D]drunkard’s feet
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [D]started home to change my life
To [D]see [G]my long [D]neglected wife
I [D]found [G]her kneeling by [D]her bed
She [D]said [A]our darling baby [D]was dead
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I [D]took her by her trembling hand
She [D]was [G]so weak she could [D]not stand
On [D]bended [G]knees I prayed [D]a prayer
That [D]God [A]might save and protect [D]us there
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Who [D]preached like Paul who once did say
Our [D]sins [G]have all been [D]washed away
That [D]whiskey [G]stay as far [D]from me
as [D]the [A]mountains are from the deep [D]blue sea
{end_of_verse}
