{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Dusty old farmer out working your fields
Hanging down over your tractor [D7]wheels
The sun beatin' down turns the red pain to orange
And rusty old patches of [G]steel
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
There's no farmer songs on that car radio
Just cowboys truck drivers and [C]pain
Well this is my [D7]way to say [G]thanks for the [Em]meal
And I [Am]hope there's no [D7]shortage of [G]rain
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Straw hats and old dirty hankies
Moping a face like a [D7]shoe
Thanks for the meal here's a song that is real
From a kid from the city to [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Straw hats and old dirty hankies
Moping a face like a [D7]shoe
Thanks for the meal here's a song that is real
From a kid from the city to [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
The combines gang up take most of the bread
Things just ain't like they used to [D7]be
Though your kids are out after the American dream
And they're workin’ in big facto[G]ries
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
If I come by when you're out in the sun
Can I wave at you just like a [C]friend
These days when [D7]everyone's [G]taking so [Em]much
There's [Am]somebody [D7]giving back [G]in
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Straw hats and old dirty hankies
Moping a face like a [D7]shoe
Thanks for the meal here's a song that is real
From a kid from the city to [G]you
{end_of_verse}
