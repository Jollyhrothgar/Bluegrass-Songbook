{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Mid [A]the green fields of Virginia
In the [D]veil of Shenandoah
There’s an [E]ivy covered homestead that [A]I love
With [A]it’s white old fashioned chimney
And it’s [D]simple homelike hours
Tis the [E]home of my dear parents now [A]above
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
There’s [A]a peaceful cottage there
A happy home so [A]dear
My [E]heart is longing for them day [A]by day
Where [A]I spent life’s golden hours
In the [D]veil of Shenandoah
Mid the [E]green fields for Virginia far [A]away
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Mid [A]the green fields of Virginia
Stands an [D]old mill by the stream
I once [E]wondered to that spot to sing [A]and play
And [A]how often I would throw the stone
Into [D]the pebbling brook
I would [E]dream someday it’d carry me [A]away
{end_of_verse}
