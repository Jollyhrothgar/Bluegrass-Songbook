{start_of_verse}
I needed you when I met you
You were just playing around
While I painted dreams of our everlasting love
You were just painting the town
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Then when you said it was over
I found the heart good and true
Now that it’s too late you’ve discovered
You needed me like I needed you
{end_of_verse}
