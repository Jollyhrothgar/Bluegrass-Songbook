{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Tonight [G]I’m [C]alone without you [G]my dear
It [Em]seems there’s [A7]a longing for [D7]you still
All [G]I have to do now [C]is sit alone [G]and cry
In our [Em]little [D7]cabin home on [G]the hill
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Now [C]someone [D7]has taken [G]you from me
And [Em]left [A7]me here [D7]all alone
Just [G]listen to the [C]rain beat on my [G]window pane
In our [Em]little [D7]cabin home on [G]the hill.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I hope you are happy [C]tonight as [G]you are
But [Em]in my heart there’s [A7]a longing for [D7]you still
I’ll [G]just keep it [C]there so I won’t [G]be alone
In our [Em]little [D7]cabin home on [G]the hill
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now when you have come to [C]the end of [G]the way
And [Em]there’s no more [A7]happiness [D7]for you
Just [G]let your heart drift (turn) [C]back once more, if [G]you will
To our [Em]little [D7]cabin home on [G]the hill.
{end_of_verse}
