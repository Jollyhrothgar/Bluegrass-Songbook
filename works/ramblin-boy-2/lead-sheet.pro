{start_of_verse}
He was a friend and a pal always
He stuck with me in the hard old days
He never cared if I had no dough
We rambled round though the rain and snow
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
In Tulsa town we chanced to stray
We thought we’d try for work one day
The boss said he had room for one
Said my old pal we’d rather bum
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Here’s to you my ramblin’ by
May all your ramblin’ bring you joy
Here’s to you my ramblin’ by
May all your ramblin’ bring you joy
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Late one in a jungle camp
The weather it was cold and damp
He got a chills and he got ’em bad
They took the only pal I had
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
He’s left me here to ramble on
My rambling pal he’s dead and gone
If when we die we go somewhere
I’ll be you a dollar he’s ramblin’ there
{end_of_verse}
