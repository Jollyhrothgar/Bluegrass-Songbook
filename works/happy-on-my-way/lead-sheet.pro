{start_of_verse}
I want to thank Jesus for the way that I feel
I’m so full of religion I just can’t be still
I want to sing it and shout it and let the people know
That I’m saved by his mercy and I’m ready to go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
(That’s why I’m Happy) Yes I’m happy happy on my way
(Rejoicing and singing) His praises everyday
For Jesus is near me and there he will stay
(That’s why I’m happy) Yes I’m happy happy on my way
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
I just can’t see why you sinners go on
Livin’ in sorrow doin’ so wrong
Hidin’ your face from the savior above
Denying yourself his wonderful love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
What a wonderful feeling just to know I am saved
And the Savior will guide me ’til I enter the grave
And then he will greet me at heaven’s open door
And I’ll live in glory with Him forever more
{end_of_verse}
