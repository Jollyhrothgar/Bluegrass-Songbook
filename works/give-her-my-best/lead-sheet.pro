{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I don't wanna fight about it [F]we've been friends too long
[G7]Someone ought to tell you [F]buddy [G7]you've been [C]wrong
You know that I stepped aside so [F]you and she could wed
[D7]You've spent half your married life [G7]in someone else's bed
[C]Just tell her that you met someone you [F]used to know before
Give her my best [G7]you never gave her [C]yours
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
There's nothing I can tell you [F]that you don't already know
[G7]You two people made your choice [F]a long [G7]long time [C]ago
I'm not bitter it just hurts when [F]someone lets you down
[D7]I just feel she ought to know [G7]that I am still around
[C]She might need to talk to me and [F]that's what friends are for
Give her my best [G7]you never gave her [C]yours
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I wonder if you know the way I [F]feel about her now
[G7]You're like the dog that sleeps on hay and [F]keeps it [G7]from the [C]cow
She's not mine but if she were [F]she wouldn't be alone
[D7]For what it's worth she's worth more love [G7]than you have ever shown
[C]You've got my word I wouldn't know [F]what happens behind your door
Give her my best [G7]you never gave her [C]yours
{end_of_verse}
