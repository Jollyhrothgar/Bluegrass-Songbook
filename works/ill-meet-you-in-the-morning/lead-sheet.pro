I’ll meet you in the morning by the [D]bright [A]riverside

At the [B]close of life’s long [E]weary day

I’ll [A]meet you in the morning [D]with a how do [A]you do
And we’ll sit down by the river and when all the rapture is [E]renewed
You’ll [A]know me in the morning by [D]the smile that [A]I wear
When I meet you in the morning In the city that is [E]built [A]four square
{end_of_verse}

There will be no disappointments and [D]nobody [A]shall die
In that [B]land when life’s sun [E]goeth down
