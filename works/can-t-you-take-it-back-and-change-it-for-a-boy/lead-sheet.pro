{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]From the nursery creepin' a little boy came peepin'
Shyly peepin' through a golden [G7]curl
At a tiny bundle such a funny bundle
[D7]Was a tiny little baby [G7]girl
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]Came to town that mornin' as the day was dawnin'
Mother thought t'would [C7]fill his heart with [F]joy
But he shook his little head [C]and to his mammy said
[D7]Gee I wish that you had bought a [G7]boy
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]Can't you take it back and change it for [D7]another
I [G7]don't want no little sister don't you [C]see
Cause I'd rather have a little baby [G7]brother
Who could [D7]play a game of ball with [G7]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]For it ain't no fun to play with dolls and [D7]such things
A [G7]girl you know could never fix a [C]toy
So I'll tell you what to do if it's [F]just the same with you
Can't you [G7]take it back and change it for a [C]boy
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Now ain't it awful funny did it cost much money
Won't it be an awful lot of [G7]care
It t'ain't a good one mother you'll have to get another
[D7]Can't you see it hasn’t any [G7]hair
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
[C]Don’t its teeth come with it will its nose grow will it
Don't it make an [C7]awful lot of [F]noise
Take it back today [C]take it right away
And [D7]buy one where they only sell just [G7]boys
{end_of_verse}
