{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
If you’re traveling in the [A]north [E]country fair
Where the wind blows cold on the [A]borderline[E]
Remember [E7]me to [A]the one who [E]lives there
For she once was a [A]true love [E]of mine.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Well if you’re going in a [A]snowflake [E]storm
Where the rivers freeze and [A]summers [E]end
Will you see that she has a [A]coat [E]so warm
To protect her from the [A]howling [E]wind.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Please see for me if her [A]hair [E]hangs low
And flows in ringlets [A]’round [E]her breasts
Please see for me if her [A]hair [E]hangs low
For that’s the way I [A]remember [E]her best.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Well I wonder if she’ll [A]remember me [E]you know
Many times I’ve [A]often [E]prayed
In the stillness [A]of [E]my night
In the brightness [A]of [E]my day.
{end_of_verse}
