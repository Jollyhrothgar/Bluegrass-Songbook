{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]At the end of a [F]long lonely [C]day without you
When [G7]the world seems to fall in my [C]face
I'm all right through the [F]day but the [C]day fades away
And the [G7]long lonely night takes its [C]place
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
An[G7]other day to wish that [F]you were [C]here
I [G7]dread each lonely night that's [F]filled with [C]fear
Oh I've tried and I've [F]tried these are [C]tears that I can't hide
At the [G7]end of a long lonely [C]day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
At the end of the [F]day I go [C]up to my room
And [G7]I watch while the sun fades [C]away
And the loneliness [F]there brings me [C]grief and despair
At the [G7]end of a long lonely [C]day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
To[G7]morrow means another [F]day to [C]cry
It [G7]makes no difference if I [F]live or [C]die
With a world locked out[F]side I just [C]lay there and cry
At the [G7]end of a long lonely [C]day
{end_of_verse}
