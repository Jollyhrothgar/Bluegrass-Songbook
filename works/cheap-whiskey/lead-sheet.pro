{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]He sits all alone in his [Em]easy chair 
Staring [G]back on his [D7]lost yester[G]days
Long before he encountered the [Em]bottle 
And the [G]demons that [D7]drove her [G]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
In his hand he is holdin' her [Em]photograph 
Her [G]image all [D7]tear stained and [G]worn
Tonight he's embracin' reali[Em]ty 
And he [G]curses the [D7]day he was [G]born
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And the [C]darkness still echoes her [G]warning
You [C]can't have two [G]loves in your [Em]life
Now the [G]things that will haunt him till the day that he [C]dies
Is the [G]smell of cheap whiskey and the [D7]sound of good[G]bye
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Since the hour she left he's been [Em]sober
Each [G]breath that he [D7]draws makes him [G]think
By the love of his life gone for[Em]ever
When he [G]traded her [D7]love for a [G]drink

And the [C]darkness still echoes her [G]warning
You [C]can't have two [G]loves in your [Em]life

Is the [G]smell of cheap whiskey and the [D7]sound of good[G]bye
