{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Tomorrow is uncertain as [C]today was yesterday
But we're [G]granted [C]all [G]assurance
When we [A7]kneel down and [D7]pray
[G]Our Heavenly Father knows the [C]future and the past
He'll [G]see us [C]through what[G]ever comes
We [D7]only have to [G]ask
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
If the [D7]days are filled with sunshine
Or [C]if they're dark and [G]cold
As [C]long as [G]I have [Am]Jesus
[G]I can face [D7]tomorrow all [G]day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Tomorrow's one day closer to [C]heaven's perfect plan
And it's [G]good to [C]know that [G]while we wait
He [A7]holds us in His [D7]hands
No [G]matter is too great no [C]measure is to small
He [G]knows our [C]needs our [G]soul He'll feed
If [D7]on His name we'll [G]call
