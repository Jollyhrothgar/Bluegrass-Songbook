{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
There’s a [G]girl in the mountain that [C]I call my [G]mountain honey
And I love her like the flowers love the [D]dew
All the [G]fellars try to claim her but [C]someday I’m [G]gonna claim her
‘Cause my wild [D]mountain honey loves [G]me to
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
She’s my [C]wild mountain honey and [G]I love her yes I do
She’s as sweet as any honey in the [D]comb
She’s as [G]pretty as the flowers that [C]are blooming in [G]the mountains
And I’m going to marry [D]her and bring [G]her home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Oh I [G]met her in the Smokey [C]Mountains down in [G]Tennessee
When the mountain laurel was blooming in the [D]spring
Everything [G]is bright and sunny and [C]I’m saving up [G]my money
For my wild mountain [D]honey’s [G]wedding ring
{end_of_verse}
