{start_of_chorus}
Blue [A]skies and teardrops got [D]me [A]down
And [A]the [E]wheat straw in the wind keeps [A]blowing round and round.
Miles [A]full of emptiness is [D]all [A]I’ve found
And [E]the road says you’ve got to move [A]along.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Does [A]anybody passing by know [D]how [A]I feel?
As [A]another [E]morning settles like [A]the dust behind my heels
In [A]the shadow of a restless soul [D]born [A]on wheels
I’m [E]bound to sing the highway’s in [A]the song.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Now [A]the wandering song within me is a song [D]I’ve [A]learned
When [A]I [E]heard the freight trains whistle and [A]my head was turned
The [A]carefree chorus of that liner [D]as [A]she burned
Now [E]the lineman says you’ve got to move [A]along.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now [A]I left the years and miles lying [D]where [A]they fell
Among [E]the book my soul was written and the tales [A]my shoes could tell
I [A]left them lying there for someone [D]else [A]to tell
And [E]the road says you’ve got to move [A]along.
{end_of_verse}
