{start_of_verse}
The stars up in the sky remind me of your eyes
And the way they use to gaze into mine
The moon up above brings back memories of love
I thought was true and so divine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
So never again, oh never no more
Never again will I knock upon your door
Never again but these words I can say
I’ll try not to love and stay out of your way
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
We had the greatest start but deep within your heart
You led me on before I knew the score
You cheated and you lied I stayed right by your side
Until one day simply closed the door
{end_of_verse}
