{start_of_verse}
I’m continually amazed with wonder
At all the things you do
There’s no escaping this spell I’m under
That’s all in my love for you.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Now I hold you close and hear you whisper
Your love for me is true
These are the words I try to say
That’s all in my love for you.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
So as I am as we believe
in love songs when they’re new
And I believe in what I feel
That’s all in my love for you.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Those things I said the other night
When you had seen me blue
Your common sense for what is right
That’s all in my love for you.
{end_of_verse}
