{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]We catch our memories wandering through the past from time to time
As mountain family music fills [G7]again inside our mind
We [Am]dream about [C]Allegheny hills and [F]West Virginian [C]land
And an old time family [G7]bluegrass [C]band
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Our God fearing mom and daddy raised us young'uns on a song
By the banks where old new river gently [G7]sways and rolled along
Where [Am]once upon a [C]time there dwelled a [F]close knit mountain [C]clan
An old time family [G7]bluegrass [C]band
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
You [F]never heard the like of melo[C]dies our family played
The guitar kept the [Am]rhythm as the [C]fiddle sawed [G7]away
We [Am]recall a banjo ringing and a [F]singing mando[C]lin
In an old time family [G7]bluegrass [C]band
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Daddy slapped the upright momma strummed the other part
We couldn’t read the music we just [G7]played it all by heart
Lord [Am]hallowed songs just [C]flowed across that [F]fertile mountain [C]land
On the old time family [G7]bluegrass [C]band
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I see us sittin' round the porch on starry summer nights
I remember how the music made my [G7]world seem good and right
When [Am]all the folks [C]would raise their happy [F]voices and join [C]in
With the old time family [G7]bluegrass [C]band
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
You [F]never heard the like of melo[C]dies our family played
The guitar kept the [Am]rhythm as the [C]fiddle sawed [G7]away
We [Am]recall a banjo ringing and a [F]singing mando[C]lin
In an old time family [G7]bluegrass [C]band
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Yes an old time family [G7]bluegrass [C]band
{end_of_verse}
