{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I found her in the morning sunshine [F]standing by the [Dm]road
She [G7]said she was a traveler with no [C]place to go
I told her I was going there and [F]offered her a [Dm]ride
I was [G7]taken with the look in Sarah's [C]eyes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
We laughed and talked and told each other [F]everything we [Dm]knew
And [G7]we made love in the warm sunshine and [C]afternoon
She had no strings or hang ups and we [F]found a natural [Dm]high
When I [G7]made the love light shine in Sara's [C]eyes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I said I am so glad I [G7]found you
She said [Dm]my arms feel [G7]so right [F]around [C]you
I will always [F]love [Dm]you there'll [G7]be no other love in Sarah's [C]eyes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Time sure takes it's time when you got [F]no place else to [Dm]be
And [G7]purpose takes the pleasure out of [C]being free
We travel light and we never once looked [F]back or wonder [Dm]why
Till I [G7]saw a troubled look in Sarah's [C]eyes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Then on a cold night in Chicago she lay [F]crying in my [Dm]arms
Her [G7]fever raged and burned as the new life in her [C]forms  
Then just before she left this world she [F]smiled and said good[Dm]bye
I [G7]watched the soul take flight from Sarah's [C]eyes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
And I cried I will always [G7]love you 
She said [Dm]I'll be [G7]waiting [C]for you
Until we're back [F]toget[Dm]her 
No [G7]life will ever shine in Sarah's [C]eyes
{end_of_verse}
