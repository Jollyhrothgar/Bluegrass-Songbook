{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Sometimes at night [F]when I'm all [C]alone 
The sounds of the day fade [G7]away
[C]Alone in my room [F]with my [C]memories 
The winds of [F]yester[C]day [G7]blow on [C]me 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I hear [F]country music on the [C]radio 
The way that it was a long time [G7]ago 
And the [C]sound of momma singing comes [F]drifting through the [C]trees 
When the winds of [F]yester[C]day [G7]blow on [C]me 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I see a moon so bright over [F]cotton fields of [C]white 
The fragrance of magnolias ride the [G7]breeze 
And that [C]little two room school where I [F]learned the Golden [C]Rule 
When the winds of [F]yester[C]day [G7]blow on [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I see [F]children at the old swimming [C]hole 
And fishing on the river with an old cane [G7]pole
Each [C]memory is so dear each [F]face is so [C]clear 
When the winds of [F]yester[C]day [G7]blow on [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I can [F]hear the choir sing [C]how their voices ring 
I remember the words to each [G7]song 
[C]Oh and that old preacher man [F]once more sets my heart at [C]ease
When the winds of [F]yester[C]day [G7]blow on [C]me 
When the winds of [F]yester[C]day [G7]blow on [C]me 
{end_of_verse}
