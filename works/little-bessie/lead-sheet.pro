{start_of_verse}
Hug me close dear mother closer
Put your arms around me tight
For I am cold and tired, dear mother
And I feel so strange tonight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Something hurts me here, dear mother
Like a stone upon my breast
Oh I wonder, wonder mother
Why it is I cannot rest
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
All the day as you were working
And I lay upon my bed
I was trying to be patient
And to think of what you said
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
How the King, Blessed Jesus
Loves His lambs to watch and keep
Oh, I wish He would come and take m
In His arms that I might sleep
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Just before the lamps were lighted
Just before the children came
While the room was very quiet
I heard someone call my name
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
All at once a window opened
On a field of lambs and sheep
Some far out were in a brook drinking
Some were lying fast asleep
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
In a moment I was looking
On a world so bright and fair
Which was filled with little children
And they seemed so happy there
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
They were singing oh so sweetly
Sweetest songs I ever heard
They were singing sweeter mother
Than our own little birds
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
But I could not see the Savior
Though I strained my eyes to see
And I wonder if He saw me
Would He speak to such as me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
All at once a window opened
One so bright upon me smiled
And I knew it must be Jesus
When He said come here, my child
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Come up here, little Bessie
Come up here and live with me
Where little children never suffer
Suffer through eternity
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Then I thought of all you told me
Of that bright and happy land
I was going when you called me
When you came and kissed my hand
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
And at first I felt so sorry
You had called, I would go
Oh, to sleep and never suffer
Mother, don’t be crying so
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Hug me close dear mother closer
Put your arms around me tight
Oh how much I love you mother
And how strong I feel tonight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
And her mother pressed her closer
To her own dear burdened breast
On the heart so near it’s breaking
Lay the heart so near it’s rest
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
At the solemn hour of midnight
In the darkness calm and deep
Laying on her mother’s bosom
Little Bessie fell asleep
{end_of_verse}
