{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I [C]was born in Dixie in a boomer shack
Just a little shanty by the [G7]railroad [C]track
The humming of the driver was my lullaby
And a freight train whistle taught [G7]me how [C]to cry
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [C]got the freight train blues Lawdy Lawdy
Got them in the bottom of [D7]my [G7]rambling shoes
And [C]when the whistle blows I gotta Oh [C7]Lawdy
Guess I’m never gonna lose the freight train blues
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
My [C]daddy was a fireman and my mammy dear
Was the only daughter of [G7]the [C]engineer
My sweetie is a brakeman and that ain’t no joke
It’s a shame the way she keeps a [G7]good [C]man broke
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Aeroplanes and autos always leave me cold
The moaning of a steamboat never stirs my soul
The only thing that makes me want to navigate
Is a wildcat whistle on a south bound freight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I know I’m old enough to quit this running round
I’ve tried a hundred times to stop and settle down
But every time I find a place I’d like to stay
I hear a freight train holler and I’m on my way
{end_of_verse}
