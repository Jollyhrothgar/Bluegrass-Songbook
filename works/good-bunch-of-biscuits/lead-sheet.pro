{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Back [G]in the days when I was a lad
There [G]was only one thing that could make me glad
A good bunch of [D]biscuits a good batch [G]of biscuits
Mama [G]could make mighty good gravy
And [G]there was never no buts nor maybes
We’d get [D]biscuits a good bunch [G]of biscuits
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Papa [G]didn’t cuss but just a little bit
But if [G]mama didn’t cook ’em he’d throw a big fit
Pass me them [D]biscuits those High [G]Life biscuits
And [G]us little kids all sixteen of us
If [G]mama didn’t make ’em you could hear us fuss
I want another [D]biscuit a good bunch [G]of biscuits
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Three [C]times a day seven days a week
We [G]just couldn’t resist it
Clean [C]up the plate that was our fate;
We [A]didn’t leave a [D]solitary biscuit
I [G]don’t see how mama ever did make ’em
Enough [G]to keep up with the way we ate ’em
A good bunch of [D]biscuits a fine bunch [G]of biscuits
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I [G]love a man sop red-eyed gravy
With a [G]biscuit so light it’ll drive you crazy
A good bunch of [D]biscuits a good bunch [G]of biscuits
Most [G]of us kids had our fingernails nipped
It was [G]caused by grabbin’ them hot-fried biscuits
Goodness [D]gracious they’re [G]good biscuits
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I [G]turned eighteen I got me a wife
Oughtta [G]be slapped for it the rest of my life
But I got [D]biscuits a fine bunch [G]of biscuits
If I [G]ever get rich we’ll have a lot more
But [G]I’ll keep eatin’ just like I was before
Goodness [D]gracious they’re [G]good biscuits
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
A good bunch of [D]biscuits a fine bunch [G]of biscuits
Goodness [D]gracious I got [G]biscuits
{end_of_verse}
