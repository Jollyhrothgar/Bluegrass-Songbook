{start_of_chorus}
Ain’t I been good to you
Done all that I can do
So faithful and so true
Ain’t I been good to you
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
I’ve tried and tried and tried
To keep you satisfied
But you found somebody new
Even though I was good to you.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
It’s causin’ me such pain
Sweetheart, I can’t explain
I can’t believe we’re through
‘Cause I’ve been so good to you.
{end_of_verse}
