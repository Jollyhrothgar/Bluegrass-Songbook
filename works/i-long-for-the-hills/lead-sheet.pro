{start_of_verse}
I saw a man a – walkin’
His hands were in his pocket
His head was hangin’, lookin’ at his feet
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Well he looked up and saw me
And asked me for a quarter
Or if I knew a good cheap place to eat
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Well I just shrugged my shoulders
Said, “If I could help you brother
I wouldn’t be out walkin’ on the street
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
With nothin’ more to say
Just turned and walked away
Hopin’ for a richer man to meet.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
I long for the old home
I long for the hills
Swingin’ on the front porch
Lord knows I ain’t had my fill.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
Well I left home at fifteen
With a guitar and a dream
And a heart that needs learnin’ more of life
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I never had a job long
I never was the kind
To settle down forever with a wife
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I may have met some men
That you read about in books
And there were times that I was livin’ right
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
But I ain’t got much to show
Here livin’ on skid row
No one to help this old man through the night.
{end_of_verse}
