{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Mom says we're too [D7]young for love  [C]dad agrees it's [G]so
But the joy and bliss that I find in [A7]your kiss
Is a thrill they'll never [D7]never know
Oh-oh  [G]they say our love is a teenage [D7]dream
That [C]young love can't be [G]true 
But [A7]come what may we will hope and [C]pray
That our [D7]teenage dream comes [G]true
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Too young to date or [D7]stay out late or [C]know the meaning [G]of
Why should we conceal the [A7]way we feel
There's no certain age [D7]for love
[G]Mom should know that this is [D7]love
And [C]dad should know it [G]too
Don't give [A7]in with faith we [C]win
We'll [D7]make our dream come [G]true
