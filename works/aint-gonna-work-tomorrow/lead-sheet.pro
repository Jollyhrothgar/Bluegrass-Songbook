{start_of_chorus}
I ain’t gonna work tomorrow
Ain’t gonna work today
Ain’t gonna work tomorrow, lord
For that is my wedding day
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
I love my mama and papa too
I love my mama and papa too
I love my mama and papa too
But I’d leave them both to go with you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I’ve been all around this country
I’ve been all around this world
I’ve been all around this country, lord
For the sake of one little girl
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I’m leaving you this lonesome song
I’m leaving you this lonesome song
I’m leaving you this lonesome song
Cause I’m gonna be gone before long
{end_of_verse}
