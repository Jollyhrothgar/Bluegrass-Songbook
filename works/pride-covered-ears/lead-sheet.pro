{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]It sounds like a mad heard of elephants
Just [C]trampled right through our [G]front room
And added to that a wild heard of horses
[A7]Stampeding through the dark dreary [D7]gloom
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But [G]it's only the beating of a sad aching heart
Com[C]bined with the falling of [G]tears
Ain't it [C]strange how the mind exagge[G]rates little sounds 
That [D7]pride covered ears barely [G]hear 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]I hear a [D7]time bomb loudly [G]ticking away
Any [C]minute it's [D7]going to ex[G]plode  
But it's [C]really just the [D7]clock on the [G]wall down the hall 
[A7]Counting seconds till you walk out the [D7]door
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
And it [G]sounds like a man is screaming for his bride
But it's [C]really just me whispering please [G]stay dear 
Ain't it [C]strange how the mind exagge[G]rates little sounds
That [D7]pride covered ears barely [G]hear   
{end_of_verse}
