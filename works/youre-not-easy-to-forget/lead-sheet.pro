{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I [C]make all the honky tonks [F]and taverns
Just [G7]to see who’s [C]hanging ’round
Tryin’ to drown away all my sorrows
Cause my darlin’ let me down
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Oh [F]I could get someone [C]to love me
And I could get someone [G7]to care
But [C]when I need someone [C7]to true [F]love me
You’re [G7]not easy [C]to forget.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Last [C]night while dancin’ with [F]my new love
And [G7]gazin’ into her eyes [C]of blue
I knew that I could have [F]loved her
If [G7]I never [C]dated you.
{end_of_verse}
