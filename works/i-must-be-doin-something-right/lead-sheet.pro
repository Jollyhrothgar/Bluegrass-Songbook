[D7]I can't give [G]her all the things that I [G7]wish that I could [C]give
And [G]Lord she [C]knows there's [G]not much change [D7]in sigh[A7]t  [D7]
She could [G]walk out any time for a [G7]better way to [C]live

If she [G]wanted to be free she could [G7]have most every[C]thing
With [G]me she's [C]only [G]had an uphill [D7]fight[A7]   [D7]
But if [G]my love was a song it's the [G7]only one she'd [C]sing
So I [G]guess I must be [D7]doing something [G]right

Then I give [G]thanks to [B7]Him a[Em]bove[D7] 
Cause He [C]blessed this house with [G]love
