{start_of_verse}
When my Savior calls me over yonder
I’ll have me a mansion on the other side
Gonna tell my neighbor how glad I am to see him
When I get home I’m going be satisfied
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I’ll have me a harp of gold just like David’s
When i get over on the other side
Gonna sing and play with a band of a million angels
When I get home I’m gonna be satisfied
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I’ll have a little talk with Abraham and Isaac
Have a little talk with Peter James and Paul
Gonna sit  and have a talk with dad and mother
Gonna have a talk with Jesus first of all
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Now when I meet my Savior over yonder
I’ll have me a mansion on the other side
I’ll leave my worldly troubles here behind me
When I get home I’m going be satisfied
{end_of_verse}
