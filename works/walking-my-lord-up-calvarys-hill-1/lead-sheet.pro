{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]On the cross as He hung in [F]shame was for[C]saken
As [F]they drove the nails [C]in His [D7]hands and His [G7]feet
As d[C]eath closed His eyes His [F]cries went to [C]heaven
Oh [F]Father for[C]give them I [G7]hear Him re[C]peat

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
One [F]morning past day break as the crowd slowly [C]gathered  
Like a sheep He was humble to His father’s own [G7]will
So sad was His [F]face that the birds hushed their [C]singing
They were walking my Lord [G7]up Calvary’s [C]Hill

In a tomb He was laid but [F]death could not [C]hurt Him
He was [F]God’s only [C]son in [D7]this world be[G7]low

I [F]want to thank [C]Jesus for He’s [G7]coming a[C]gain
