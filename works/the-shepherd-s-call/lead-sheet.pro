{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I wandered far from the fold where I was [C]safe
It wasn't [D7]long till [C]I found I'd lost my [G]way
I cried with fear as the night began to [C]fall
One more lost [D7]lamb but I heard the Shepherd's [G]call
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
He saw my steps as they walked right into the [C]dark
Though I went [D7]astray I never once left His [G]heart
That night long ago how I still [C]recall
When I lost my [D7]way I heard the Shepherd's [G]call
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
He left the fold to search out one that [C]strayed
Left ninety [D7]nine for [C]there was one to be [G]saved
There on that ledge one step would have ended it [C]all
But I felt a [D7]hand and I heard the Shepherd's [G]call
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
That night long ago how I still [C]recall
When I lost my [D7]way I heard the Shepherd's [G]call
{end_of_verse}
