{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]When you went away [G7]I [C]cried
I was [F]hurt down deep [C]inside
Such misery just a broken heart can [G7]tell
Now my [C]lonesome [G7]tears I've [C]shed
And I've [F]said what should be [C]said
I can get along [G7]without you very [C]well
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Down before me [G7]on your [C]knees
[F]Forgiveness dear you [C]plead
You're sorry for the lies you used to [G7]tell
Now [C]you want me [G7]back [C]again
To [F]forgive would be a [C]sin
I can get along [G7]without you very [C]well
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
You don't seem to [C][G7]realize
All my [F]love for you has [C]died
I don't hate you but I'm sorry that I [G7]fell
For your [C]lies and tricks [G7]and [C]schemes
You're no [F]longer in my [C]dreams
I can get along [G7]without you very [C]well
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Now our love is [G7]at an [C]end
And [F]your loneliness [C]begins
How much I've loved you there's no way to [G7]tell
But it's [C]over [G7]now and [C]past
I [F]forgot your love at [C]last
I can get along [G7]without you very [C]well
{end_of_verse}
