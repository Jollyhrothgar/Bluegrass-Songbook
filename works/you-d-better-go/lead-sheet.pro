{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]You'd better go [G7]each moment that you [C]linger
Makes me [G7]forget his ring is on my [C]finger
We [F]love each other but I'm his so we must draw the [C]line
You'd better [G7]go before I change my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You'd better go [G7]for I'm afraid your [C]charms
Will [D7]shatter my resistance and I'll end up in your [G7]arms
He [C]loves me so and dear you [F]know I hate to be [C]unkind
You'd better [G7]go before I change my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
To keep you [G7]here would thrill me beyond [C]measure
But [D7]we're not always free to do the things that bring us [G7]pleasure
He [C]loves me so and dear you [F]know we'd hate ourselves in [C]time
You'd better [G7]go before I change my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}
