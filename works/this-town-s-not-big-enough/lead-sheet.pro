[G7]Today's the day I leave [C]forever
[F]This town where we once loved together
[C]Now that love is gone I guess I'm [G7]free

[C]When there's miles and miles and miles
[G7]Between this town and [C]me

[F]This town's not big enough for both of us to [C]be

[F]In every window pane your face is all I [C]see
[G7]This town's not big enough to hold both you and [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I'll drop the dreams I've held so tightly
[F]Shed my tears and travel lightly
[C]Anything to ease my heavy [G7]load
[C]I'll find a town in far-off places
[F]Where the windows have no faces
[C]Many miles from anywhere [G7]along this lonely [C]road
{end_of_verse}
