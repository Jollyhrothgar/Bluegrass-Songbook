{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Lord [G]I don’t want to do [D]one thing on [G]my own
Put me where you want me Lord  where I belong
Give me the strength Lord [C]to do thy [G]perfect will
And when I’m in the lowest valley I [D]can climb the [G]highest hill
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Lord [G]I want to be what [C]you want [G]me to be
Lord I want to do the things [C]you want [G]me to do
Lord I want to stay in the [C]center [G]of thy will
When I’m in the lowest valley I can [D]climb the [G]highest hill
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
This [G]world gets [D]more wicked [G]every day
People’s hearts have grown cold, forgotten how to pray
But if I live to be a hundred I’ll [C]keep holding to [G]your hand
Until you come and take me home [D]to that [G]promised land
{end_of_verse}
