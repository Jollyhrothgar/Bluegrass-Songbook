{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Daylight comes and bluebirds [F]sing 
[G7]And outside the grass is [C]green
But [F]I don't care if it's [D7]sunshine or it [G7]rain
[C]Cause I'm happy as I [F]can be as long [G7]as you will stand by [C]me
And [D7]nothing this side of [G7]heaven can make me [C]change
Cause y--ou  I love you  I [E7]love you  you make all my dreams come [A7]true 
[D7]You mean [G7]all the world to [C]me 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You start my day with one sweet [F]kiss
[G7]Keep my world turning with [C]tenderness
And you [F]always say the [D7]right things when I'm [G7]blue
When [C]dark clouds threaten to cover my [F]sky
And [G7]temptation looks me straight in the [C]eye
[D7]It all disappears when [G7]you say I love [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Cause y--ou  I love you  I [E7]love you  you make all my dreams come [A7]true 
[D7]You you mean [G7]all the world to [C]me 
{end_of_verse}
