{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]You say that I was all to blame that's untrue because you know
[C]I gave my heart and soul to you a million tears ago
[G]But you were satisfied at least you told me so ho-ho
[D7]That was just a wedding ring [G]ago
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I couldn't offer much to you just a promise to bring you joy
[C]And I was much too young to see you use me like a toy
[G]Then one day a stranger came her name I did not know ho-ho
[D7]That was just a wedding ring [G]ago
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
She was a millionaire it was what you wanted you thought
[C]But much too late you realize happiness could not be bought
[G]You left her now you want me back but another's love I know ho-ho
[D7]I made him mine a wedding ring [G]ago
{end_of_verse}
