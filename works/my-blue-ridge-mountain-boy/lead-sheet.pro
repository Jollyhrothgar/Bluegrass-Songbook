{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]From a shack by a mountain stream 
To a room in [C]New Or[G]leans
So far from my blue ridge mountain [D7]home
The [G]men I meet ain't warm and friendly 
Like the one in [C]old Vir[G]giny[C]
Oh [G]they ain't real like my [D7]blue ridge mountain [G]boy
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I was just a little past eighteen 
When I came to [C]New Or[G]leans
I'd never been beyond my home state [D7]line
There was a [G]boy who loved me dearly 
But I broke his [C]heart se[G]verely [C]
When I [G]left my [D7]blue ridge mountain [G]boy
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Life was [C]dull in my hometown 
Lights were [A#7]out when the [F]sun went [C]down
And I thought the city life was more my [G]style
But nights get lonely way from home 
And it's easy [C]to go [G]wrong[C]
The [G]men ain't kind like [D7]my blue ridge mountain [G]boy
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
New Orleans held things in store 
Things I've never [C]bargained [G]for
Every night a different man knocks on my [D7]door
But late at [G]night when all is still 
I can hear a [C]whippoor[G]will [C]
As I [G]cry for my [D7]blue ridge mountain [G]boy
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Oh but I [C]can't ever go back home 
Since the [A#7]boy I [F]loved is [C]gone
He grew tired of waiting for me to [G]return
They say he'd married last October 
But I never [C]will get [G]over
Oh the sweet love of my [D7]blue ridge mountain [G]boy
{end_of_verse}
