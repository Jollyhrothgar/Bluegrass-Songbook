N:From the playing of James "Skeeter Jim" Walden (1879-1956,
N:Busch, Carroll County, north Arkansas), recorded in the field in
N:1951 by Irene Jones Carlisle. He earned his nickname as a young
N:boy, who, as his permanent teeth had not grown in, garbled the
N:pronunciation of 'skeeter plane' and was teased for it.
