{start_of_verse}
I’m walking the floor with tears in my eyes
I can’t undersand dear why you ever lied
The stars in the skies have tumbled below
Now my heart is breaking it’s beating so low
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
The moment you walked dear into my heart
What a wonderful meeting for two lonely hearts
You gave me your love to have and to hold
But something has happened you took the wrong road
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
You said you would love and you would obey
But the Golden Rule’s broken so go on your way
I’ve lost all the faith that I’ve had in you
So go on away dear you could never be true
{end_of_verse}
