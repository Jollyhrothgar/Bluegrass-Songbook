{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]For years we both have lived on pride [D7]dear
And we agree that love is [G]gone
Why oh why do we keep [D7]trying
A House Without Love is not a [G]home 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The [C]love light in your eyes has [G]faded
And I'm contented just to [D7]roam
We [G]slaved to gain a worthless [D7]treasure
A House Without Love is not a [G]home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
No matter where our footsteps [D7]wander
I know we'll both be all [G]alone
With the pride that came between [D7]us
A House Without Love is not a [G]home 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
The [C]simple things have gone [G]forever 
We wanted wealth to call our [D7]own
And [G]now we've reached the hour of [D7]parting
A House Without Love is not a [G]home
{end_of_verse}
