[G]You're not my [C]same [D7]sweet baby [G]lady
You're not the [C]same [D7]sweet baby I [G]knew
The [D7]world is all wrong girl and [C]I'm not the man
[G]Who can change it for [C]you
I'll just [G]be packing my [D7]bags and silently [G]go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
What's the [D7]good in pretending [C]and watching it [G]drag on and on
The [D7]good is in ending it [C]while there's the time left
To [G]say that your mind is your [D7]own

Now the bright lights faded they've [C]taken the [D7]baby from [G]you

That [G]hard times won't break that [C]too
[G]I'll just be packing my [D7]bags and silently [G]go
