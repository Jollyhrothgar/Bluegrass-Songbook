[C]On top of old [F]Smokey all covered [C]in snow
I lost my true [G7]lover by courting too [C]slow
But courting’s [F]pleasure but parting is [C]grief 
For a false hearted [G7]lover is worse than [C]a thief
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
A thief he will just [F]rob you take what you [C]have
But a false hearted [G7]lover will take you to your [C]grave
A grave will [F]decay you turn you into [C]dust
And there just isn’t [G7]one girl a poor boy can [C]trust
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
So come all you [F]lover’s and listen [C]to me
Don’t place your [G7]affection on a green willow [C]tree       
The leave will all [F]wither the roots will [C]all die
Then you’ll be [G7]forgotten but you’ll never [C]know why
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
On top of old [F]Smokey all covered [C]in snow
I lost my true [G7]lover by courting too [C]slow
But courting’s [F]pleasure but parting is [C]grief 
For a false hearted [G7]lover is worse than [C]a thief
{end_of_verse}
