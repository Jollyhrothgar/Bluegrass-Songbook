{start_of_chorus}
I’m [G]going down this [C]lonesome road
To see my [D]fate or [G]victory
God must help us there to [C]win
I’m coming [D]back but I don’t [G]know when
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I [G]hate to leave my [C]mother dear
My father [D]who is old [G]and gray
But my true love I know you’ll [C]wait
For me to [D]come back to me [G]to stay
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Will you be here when I come home
Or will your [D]love fade like [G]a rose
I [G]could never come back should you [C]be gone
My love for [D]you [G]nobody knows
{end_of_verse}
