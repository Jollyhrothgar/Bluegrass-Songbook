[C]All the neighbors call him Jimmy when his mom and me are [G7]around

Oh you ought to see him running his little seat goes up and [G7]down
Bubble gum will buy the kisses of little baggy britches [C]Brown

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Always hopping never stopping baggy [C7]britches there he [F]goes
Always [G7]busy gosh where is he in his funny little [C]clothes
You can catch him with a cookie in his mouth most any[G7]time
Well they call him baggy britches but I’m glad to call him [C]mine

Just a kid that’s full of mischief when you leave him by his [G7]self
He’s sure to make a bee line for that jam upon the [C]shelf

She knows she’ll tan the seat of little baggy britches [C]Brown
