{start_of_chorus}
I hear a voice calling
It must be our Lord (it [A]must be our [E]Lord)
Its coming from heaven on [B]high
I hear a voice calling
I’ve gained a reward (I’ve [A]gained a [E]reward)
For the land where we never shall [B]die[E]
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
The savior who died, on cruel Calvary
He shed His life blood that the world might be free
So follow His [E]footsteps, up the narrow [A]way[E]
And be ready to meet Him when He calls on that [B]day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The savior has paid a great price [A]for [E]me
He gave His life on [B]Calvary
So I’ll follow His [E]footsteps up the narrow [A]way[E]
I’ll pay my debt on the great [B]judgment [E]day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Then she closed her eyes forever
Never to see us no more
Until we meet our darling
On that bright and peaceful shore
{end_of_verse}
