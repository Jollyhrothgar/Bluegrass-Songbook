{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I could never learn to love somebody [G7]new
You're the only one my dear will ever [C]do

In my [F]heart there is no doubt
You're the [C]only one I'll [G7]ever care [C]about

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Just a letter or a postage card will [G7]do
Won't your write sweetheart and let me hear from [C]you
Since these blues have got me down
There is [F]something I have found
You're the [C]only one I'll [G7]ever want [C]around
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Deep down inside I loved you all [G7]along
I've had time to realize that I was [C]wrong
Please believe me when I say

You're the [C]only one I'll [G7]ever wanna [C]hold
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I know now it was my fault you said [G7]goodbye
And each memory comes back to make me [C]cry
As each day draws to a close
It is [F]you I'm thinking of
You're the [C]only one I'll [G7]ever wanna [C]love
{end_of_verse}
