{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
In [C]this world today while [G7]we’re living
Some folks say the worst of us they [C]can
But when we are dead and in our [F]caskets
They [C]always slip [G7]some lilies in [C]our hand
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Won’t you give me my flowers while I’m [G7]living
And let me enjoy them while I [C]can
Pleae don’t wait till I’m ready to be [F]buried
And [C]then slip [G7]some lilies in [C]my hand
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
In this world is where we need our [G7]flowers
A kind word to help us get [C]along
If you can’t give me flowers while I’m [F]living
Then [C]please [G7]don’t throw them when [C]I’m gone
{end_of_verse}
