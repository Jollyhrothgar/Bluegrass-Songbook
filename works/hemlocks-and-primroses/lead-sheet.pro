{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Thinking [A]of you while out for a ramble
Down [D]by [E]a cold [A]frosty stream
Set [A]down on a bed of hemlocks and primroses
And [D]gently [E]I fell into [A]a dream
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [A]dreamed I saw a pretty fair maiden
Such beauty [D]I’d [E]never saw [A]before
Her [A]dress was bound round with hemlocks and primroses
So green [D]was [E]the mantel [A]she wore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Her [A]hair was of a dark brown color
Her teeth was [D]as [E]ivory [A]so white
Her [A]eyes they shined like sparking diamonds
Or stars than [D]shine [E]on a cold [A]frosty night
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I [A]drew her near then I awakened
With two empty [D]arms [E]and you on [A]my mind
Heaven [A]seemed so near while I was dreaming
It hurts to [D]know [E]you left me [A]behind
{end_of_verse}
