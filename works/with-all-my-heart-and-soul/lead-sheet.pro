{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]With all my [F]heart and [C]soul 
I'll always [F]love you
Although you've [G7]treated me so [C]wrong
With all my [F]heart and [C]soul 
I'll always [F]want you
No matter [G7]where you go 
Or how long you're [F]gone[C]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I've [G7]heard [C]everything happens for the [F]best
This is [D7]hard to believe 
How can losing you be the [G7]best for me
Every time you [C]hurt me 
My love grows [C7]stronger than [F]before
And breaking my [G7]heart only made me love you [C]more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
With all my [F]heart and [C]soul 
I'll always [F]love you
Although you've [G7]treated me so [C]wrong
With all my [F]heart and [C]soul 
I'll always [F]want you
No matter [G7]where you go 
Or how long you're [F]gone[C]
