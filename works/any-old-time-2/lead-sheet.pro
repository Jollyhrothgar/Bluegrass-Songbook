{key: G}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I just received your letter, you're down and [C]out, you [G]say
At [C]first I thought I [G]would tell you to [E]travel on the [A]other [D]way
[G]But in my memory lingers all you [C]once were to me
[C]So I'm gonna give you [G]one more chance to [E]prove what [A]you can [D]be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
[G]Any old time you wanna come back home
[C]Drop me a line and, honey, say no more you'll [G]roam
[D]You had your chance to play the game [G]fair
[A]But when you left me, sweetheart, you only left a love who [D]cared
[G]Now that you're down, I'm gonna stick by you
[G]If you will only tell me that your roaming days are through
[G]You'll find me here, just like the day you left me alone
[G]Any old time you wanna come back home
{end_of_chorus}
