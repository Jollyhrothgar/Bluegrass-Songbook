{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I have [C]heard of a land on the far away strand
‘Tis a [F]beautiful [C]home of [G7]the soul
Built by [C]Jesus on high, there we never shall die
‘Tis a [F]land where [G7]we never [C]grow old
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Never [C]grow [F]old, never [C]grow old
In a land where we’ll never grow [G7]old
Never [C]grow [F]old, never [C]grow old
In a land where we’ll never grow [G7]old
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
In that [C]beautiful home where we’ll never more roam
We shall [F]be in [C]the sweet by [G7]and by
Happy [C]praise to the king thru eternity sing
‘Tis a [F]land where [G7]we never [C]shall die
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
When our [C]work here is done and the life crown is won
And [F]out troubles [C]and trials [G7]are o’er
All our [C]sorrows will end and our voices will blend
With the [F]loved ones [G7]who’ve gone [C]on before
{end_of_verse}
