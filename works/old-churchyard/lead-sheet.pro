{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Come [Db]come with me to [Db]the old churchyard
I [Db]so well know those paths [Db]neath the [Db]soft green sward
Friends [Db]slumber there that [Db]we want to regard
We will [Db]trace out their names in [Db]the old [Db]churchyard
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Mourn not [Db]for them for their trials [Db]are o’er
Why weep [Gb]for those [Db]who will weep no more
For [Gb]sweet [Db]is their [Db]sleep though cold and hard
Their pillows lay [Db]deep in the old [Db]churchyard
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I [Db]know that it’s vain when [Db]our friends depart
To [Db]breathe kind words to [Gb]a broken heart
And I [Db]know that the joy [Db]of life is marred
When [Db]we follow lost friends to [Gb]the old [Db]churchyard
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
But [Db]were I at rest [Db]beneath yonder tree
Why [Gb]would [Db]you [Db]weep my friends for me
So [Gb]weary [Db]and [Db]worn why would you retard
The [Db]peace that I seek [Gb]in the old churchyard
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Why [Ab]weep for [Db]me for [Ab]I’m anxious to go
To the [Db]haven of rest where [Gb]no tears will flow
And I fear not to enter that dark lonely tomb
Where our savior has lain and conquered the gloom
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
I rest in the [Db]hope that on one [Db]bright day
Sunshine [Gb]will burst [Db]through these prisons of clay
And Gabriel’s trumpet and the voice of the Lord
Will wake [Db]up the [Gb]dead [Db]in the old churchyard
{end_of_verse}
