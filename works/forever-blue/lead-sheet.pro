{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Why was I so wrong when [G7]everything was right
I thought that you would long for my arms to hold you [C]tight
You never even called or [G7]stopped to say hello
So now I'm sad and blue while you're just glad to [C]go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Remember all the times when [G7]you were missing me
Cause I'd gone so long but not eterna[C]lly
I always turned around to [G7]find my way back home
But the only thing I found was I found myself [C]alone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And I may [F]never find another one to [G7]hold me
[F]I may never find another [G7]one so true
Maybe [F]I'll just find myself all sad and [G7]lonely
Maybe [F]I'll just never find another [G7]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Forever lonely forever [C]blue forever [G7]knowing that you were [C]true
Forever [G7]thinking you'd love me [C]too
So you've [F]gone and now I don't know what to [G7]do
So I guess I'll always be forever [C]blue
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Will you be so kind as to [G7]leave my heart alone
That's where it needs to be so it won't hurt no [C]more
As long as you're around and [G7]not here with me
My smile will be a frown forever blue I'll [C]be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And I may [F]never find another one to [G7]hold me
[F]I may never find another [G7]one so true
Maybe [F]I'll just find myself all sad and [G7]lonely
Maybe [F]I'll just never find another [G7]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Forever lonely forever [C]blue forever [G7]knowing that you were [C]true
Forever [G7]thinking you'd love me [C]too
So you've [F]gone and now I don't know what to [G7]do
So I guess I'll always be forever [C]blue
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
So you've [F]gone and now I don't know what to [G7]do
So I guess I'll always be forever [C]blue
{end_of_verse}
