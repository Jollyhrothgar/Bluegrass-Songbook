[C]Don't mind the teardrops on the [C7]roses that I [F]sent you
I [C]didn't mean to show my broken heart this [G7]way
No [C]matter what you do you'll [C7]never lose my [F]love dear
As far as [C]I'm concerned [G7]you're in my heart to [C]stay
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And [F]if the teardrops make the red red roses [C]fade and fall apart
[Am]Throw aside the broken petals [D7]like you threw away[G7] my heart
Don't mind the [C]teardrops on the [C7]roses that I [F]sent you
I didn't [C]mean to show [G7]my broken heart this [C]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
You'll [F]find a card among the roses that I [C]sent you
Saying [Am]love like ours should [D7]never die and [G7]I'll be true
Don't [C]mind the teardrops on the [C7]roses that I [F]sent you
I didn't [C]mean to show [G7]my broken heart this [C]way
{end_of_verse}
