{start_of_verse}
I’ll deck my brow with roses the loved ones may be there
And gems that others gave me will shine within my hair
And even those who know me will think my heart in light
Though my heart may break tomorrow, I’ll be all smiles tonight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
I’ll be all smiles tonight, Love, I’ll be all smiles tonight
Though my heart may break tomorrow, I’ll be all smiles tonight
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
Oh when the dance commences, Oh how I will rejoice
I’ll sing the songs he taught me without a faulting voice
When the flattering ones come around me they’ll think my heart is light
Though my heart may break tomorrow, I’ll be all smile tonight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
And when the room he entered with a bride upon his arm
I stood and gazed upon him as though he was a charm
And once he smiled upon her as once he’d smiled at me
They knew not what I suffered, they found no change in me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
And when the dance is over and all have gone to rest
I’ll think of him, dear Mother, the one that I love best
He once did love me dearly and ne’er from me would part
He sought not to deceive me, false friends have changed his heart
{end_of_verse}
