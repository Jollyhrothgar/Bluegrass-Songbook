{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Smokey the bar lights dimly [F]low
It’s [G7]good that way cause heartaches don’t [C]show
Each hand holds a glass  each glass holds a [F]beer
Jukebox records [G7]play amid sorrow and [C]cheer
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]Lots of them are happy they laugh [G7]and tell their [C]jokes
While [D7]lots of them are here because they’re just lonely [G7]folks
And [C]then there are others whose hearts wear a [F]scar
But you can’t see them [G7]crying it’s old Smokey the [C]bar
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Smokey the bar lights glowing [F]dim
They hardly [G7]notice when someone walks [C]in
Order up your drink to the music that’s [F]loud
You’ll find a [G7]friend somewhere in the [C]crowd
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[F]While the ashes are falling from [G7]the smoke that you [C]inhale
There’s an [D7]old dream to recall or a new one that [G7]failed
Should a [C]tear betray your eye if memory slips to [F]far
Don’t tell them that you’re [G7]crying just say Smokey the [C]bar
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Repeat last verse
{end_of_verse}
