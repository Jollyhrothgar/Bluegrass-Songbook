[C]At seven[G7]teen in [Am]faded [C]jeans [F]I was yours and you were [C]mine[G7]
[C]Close [G7]enough to [Am]call it [C]love [D7]but we never crossed the [G7]line
[F]After knowing [C]you love's been nothing new 
[E7]I've had it good and I've [Am]had it [F]bad
[C]But after [G7]all these [C]years you still [F]bring the [C]tears 
You're the [G7]best I never [C]had [G7]

[C]A perfect [G7]start [Am]for virgin [C]hearts [F]but it ended all so [C]fast[G7]
[C]Old [G7]enough to [Am]have been the [C]first [D7]but too young to make it [G7]last
[F]I never let it show [C]ah I should've let you know 
[E7]I never wanted [Am]someone so [F]bad
[C]Looking [G7]back I've learned [C]with every [F]bridge I've [C]burned 
You're the [G7]best I never [C]had [G7]   [Am]   [G7]

[C]The [G7]flame is gone [C]but the fire burns on 
[F]Sometimes sweet and some[C]times sad [G7]
[C]Girl you'll [G7]always be a [C]haunting [F]mystery 
[C]You're the [G7]best I never [C]had [F]
[C]After [G7]all these years [C]you still [F]bring the [C]tears 
You're the [G7]best I never [C]had
