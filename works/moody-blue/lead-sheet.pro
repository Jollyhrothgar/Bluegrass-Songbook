{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Well it's hard to be a gambler betting on the number
[D7]That changes every time
When you think you're gonna win think she's giving in
[G]A stranger's all you find
Yeah it's hard to figure out what she's all about
But she's [C]woman through and through
She's a [D7]complicated lady so color my baby [G]moody blue[D7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh [G]moody blue tell me am I [Am]getting through 
I keep [D7]hanging on trying to learn the song
But [G]I never do[D7]    oh [G]moody blue
Tell me who I'm [Am]talking to
You're like [D7]night and day
And it's hard to say which [G]one is you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[D7]Well when [G]Monday comes she's Tuesday
When Tuesday comes she's Wednesday [D7]into another day again
Her personality unwinds just like a ball of twine
[G]On a spool that never ends
Just when I think I know her well her emotions reveal
She's not the [C]person that I thought I knew
She's a [D7]complicated lady so color my baby [G]moody blue [D7]
