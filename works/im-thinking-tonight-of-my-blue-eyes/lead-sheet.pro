{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
‘Twould been [A]better for us both had [D]we never
In this [E]wide and wicked world had [A]never met,
But the pleasure we both seemed [D]to gather
I’m [E]sure, love, I’ll [A]never forget
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Oh, I’m [A]thinking tonight of [D]my blue eyes
Who is [E]sailing far over [A]the sea
I’m thinking tonight of my blue eyes
And I [E]wonder if he ever thinks [A]of me
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh, you [A]told me once, dear, that [D]you loved me;
You [E]vowed that we never [A]would part
But a link in the chain has been [D]broken
Leaving [E]me with a sad and [A]aching heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
When the [A]cold, cold grave [D]shall enclose me
Will you [E]come near and shed just one [A]tear?
Will you say to the [D]strangers around you
A poor [E]heart you have broken [A]lies here?
{end_of_verse}
