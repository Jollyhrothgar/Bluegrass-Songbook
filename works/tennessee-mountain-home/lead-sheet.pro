{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Sittin’ on the front porch on a summer afternoon
In a [G]straight-back chair on two legs  leaned against the wall
Watch the kids a-playin’ with June bugs on a string
And chase the glowin’ fireflies when evening shadows fall
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
In my Tennessee [C]mountain home
Life [G]is as peaceful as [D]a [G]baby’s sigh
In my Tennessee [C]mountain home
Crickets [G]singing in [D]the fields [G]near by
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Honeysuckle vines cling to the fences along the lane
Their [G]fragrance makes [D]the summer wind [G]so sweet
And on a distant hilltop an eagle spreads its wings
And a [G]songbird on a fence post sings a melody
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Drivin’ home from charch on Sunday with the one you love
Just laughin ‘talkin’ makin’ future plans
And when the folks ain’t lookin’ you might steal a kiss or two
Just [G]sittin’ [D]in the porch [G]swing holdin’ hands
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Pinacle Mountain Boys; The Pinacle Mountain Boys
{end_of_verse}
