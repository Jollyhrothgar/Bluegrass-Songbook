{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Oh I wish I had someone to [C]love me
Someone [D7]to call me [G]her own
Oh I wish I had someone to [C]live with
For [D7]I’m tired of [G]living alone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Oh please meet me tonight in the moonlight
Please meet me tonight all alone
For I have a sad story to tell you
It’s a story that’s never been told
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I’ll [G]be carried to the new jail [C]tomorrow
Leaving [D7]my poor darling [G]alone
With the cold prison bars all [C]around me
And [D7]my head on a pillow [G]of stone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now [G]I have a grand ship on [C]the ocean
All [D7]mounted with silver [G]and gold
And before my poor darling would [C]suffer
Oh [D7]that ship would be anchored [G]and sold
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Now [G]if I had wings like [C]an angel
Over [D7]these prison walls I [G]would fly
And I’d fly to the arms of my [C]poor darling
And [D7]there I’d be willing [G]to die
{end_of_verse}
