{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]A proper lady that’s exactly what I [D7]was
Always careful pretty is as pretty [G]does
I let a stranger talk me into [G7]one little [C]kiss
Oh it [D7]scares me I want some more of [G]this
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I’ve got a husband and he thinks the world of [D7]me
A home and family and everything a home could [G]be
I shouldn’t be here the things he says [G7]I have to for[C]get 
Oh it [D7]scares me I want some more of [G]this
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
If I’m [C]unfaithful on the [D7]days I have to [C]lie [G]about
Then I’m no [A7]better than those women I [D7]talked about
I’m [G]gettin’ weaker I’ve had my first taste of [D7]wine
And now he whispered I’ve lost all track of [G]time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
If he’d stop talking I’d find the [G7]strength to [C]refuse
Oh it [D7]scares me I want some more of [G]this
Yes that’s what [D7]scares me I want some more of [G]this
{end_of_verse}
