{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]The hills were alive with wild [C]flowers and [G]I
Was as wild even [D7]wilder than [G]they
For at least I could run they just [C]died in the [G]sun
And I refused to just [D7]wither in [G]place
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Just a wild [C]mountain rose needing freedom to [G]grow
So I [C]ran fearing not where I'd [D7][G]go-o-o
When a [G]flower grows wild it can [C]always [G]survive
Wildflowers don't [D7]care where they [G]grow
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And the flowers I knew in the [C]fields where I [G]grew
Were content to be [D7]lost in the [G]crowd
They were commonly close I had no [C]room to [G]grow
And I wanted so [D7]much to branch [G]out
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
So I [C]uprooted myself from my home ground and [G]left
Took [C]my dreams and I took to the [D7][G]road-o-oad
When a [G]flower grows wild it can [C]always [G]survive
Wildflowers don't [D7]care where they [G]grow
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I grew up fast and wild and I [C]never felt [G]right
In a garden so [D7]different from [G]me
I just never belonged I just [C]longed to be [G]gone
So the garden one [D7]day set me [G]free
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
I hitched a ride [C]with the wind and since he was my [G]friend
I [C]just let him decide where we'd [D7][G]go-o-o
When a [G]flower grows wild it can [C]always [G]survive
Wildflowers don't [D7]care where they [G]grow
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Just a wild [C]mountain rose seeking mysteries [G]untold
No [C]regrets for the path that I [D7][G]chose-o-ose
When a [G]flower grows wild it can [C]always [G]survive
Wildflowers don't [D7]care where they [G]grow
{end_of_verse}
