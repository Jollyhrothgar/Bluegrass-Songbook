{start_of_chorus}
Rain rain rain
I can feel the clouds of heartache moving in
Rain rain rain
You’ve got leaving on your mind again.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
Your love for me is like the changing weather
With just enough sun to keep me hanging on
And foolish me keeps hoping it’ll get better
But clouds roll in and once more you are gone.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Rainbows that appear are just illusions
That man has looked for since the days of old
And like the rainbow your love’s always moving
But I keep looking for that pot of gold.
{end_of_verse}
