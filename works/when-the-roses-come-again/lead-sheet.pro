{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Neath the [E]shadow down the [B]meadow
Leaves [A]lying on each [E]side
By the [E]river [B]flowers shiver
Fading [A]dying in [B]their pride
Someone [A]straying [E]long delaying
Sad the [C#m]parting down [B]the lane
I must [A]leave you [E]someone’s saying
Till the [B]roses [E]come again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
When the [C#m]roses [B]come again
When the [C#m]roses [B]come again
I will meet you I will greet you
When the [C#m]roses [B]come again
Yodel
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
As I [E]wander I will [B]ponder
On a [A]happy by [E]and by
On a [E]summer [B]over yonder
With [A]joy to you [B]and I
Do not [A]borrow grief [E]or sorrow
In the [C#m]hours [B]that yet remain
We shall [A]know of [E]that tomorrow
When the [C#m]roses [B]come again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Sunshine [E]over [B]clover
Blossom [A]on the [E]meadow wide
Some I [E]finger sweet [B]to linger
Everywhere [A]on [B]every side
Someone’s [A]roaming in [E]the gloaming
Happy [C#m]hearts that feel [B]no pain
All [A]their sadness turned [E]to gladness
Now the [B]roses [E]come again
{end_of_verse}
