[C]In the blue of the evening while shadows [F]still
[C]Filling my poor heart with [G7]fear
Now [C]you're gone forever you'll never [F]return
I'm [C]kissing your [G7]picture counting [C]tears
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Sometimes I wonder why you went [F]away
[C]We've been so happy all these [G7]years
You're my first [C]and my last love that's why I'm [F]blue
I'm [C]kissing your [G7]picture counting [C]tears
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
You're my sweet one and only you'll always [F]be
I'm [C]up in the heavens when you're [G7]near
But with these [C]lonely four walls I'm losing my [F]mind
I'm [C]kissing your [G7]picture counting [C]tears
{end_of_verse}
