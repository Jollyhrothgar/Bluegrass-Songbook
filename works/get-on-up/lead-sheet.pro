{start_of_verse}
Get on up some glad morning
Get on up a new days dawning
Live forever with Jesus by and by
Get on up Heaven’s waiting
Friends and loved ones celebratin’
When I get up to my mansion in the sky
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
This old body’s getting weary
This whole world’s so dark and dreary
I can’t wait to see my new home up on high
Where I’ll rest from all my labor
Paul and Silas gonna be my neighbor
When I get up to my mansion in the sky
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
And if death should overtake me
I know my Lord’s gonna wake me
Gonna get up with a brand new body glorified
With troubles and trials far behind me
Gloryland that’s where you’ll find me
When I get up to my mansion in the sky
{end_of_verse}
