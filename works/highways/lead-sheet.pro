{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Highways take me everywhere I [F]want to go 
With [G7]one exception [C]standing
That road leads in[F]to the quiet [G7]places 
In the shadows of your [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The beaten path of [F]common words 
Can [G7]only lead us to misunder[C]standing
I believe that [F]I can see the [G7]love 
For you that is a greater [C]kind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]Highways take me [C]over the [G7]mountains
Into the valleys [F]and out through the [C]plains
[F]Wanting to be in your [C]heart's understanding
[G7]I travel each highway in [C]vain
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Highways only take me into [F]places 
Where the [G7]average of the crowd [C]goes
Where they affix the [F]standard on the [G7]language 
And emotions of the [C]love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Highways [F]never reach above the [G7]ground 
And cannot know the things a [C]cloud knows
In a [F]million volumes they have [G7]never 
Written to express my [C]love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]Highways take me [C]over the [G7]mountains
Into the valleys [F]and out through the [C]plains
[F]Wanting to be in your [C]heart's understanding
[G7]I travel each highway in [C]vain
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]Highways take me [C]over the [G7]mountains
Into the valleys [F]and out through the [C]plains

[G7]I travel each highway in [C]vain
