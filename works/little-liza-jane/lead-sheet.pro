Sixteen stories high
And every story in that house
Was full of chicken pie

Oh Liza poor girl
Oh Liza Jane
Oh Liza poor girl
She died on the train

To give my horn a blow
And every girl in the countryside
Said yonder comes my beau

When I was a little boy
I liked to go in swimming
Now I am a bigger boy
I like to go with women

I wish I had a candy box
To put my sweetheart in
I’d take her out and kiss her twice
And put her back again
{end_of_verse}

One day I set a-courting
A girl as dear as life
When a woman she said to me
Mr.Jones
how is your wife
