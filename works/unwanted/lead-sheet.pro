{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]You’ll never know how it feels to be unwanted
Cause your [G7]heart’s too gay and fancy [C]free
You’d never live in a dream world that was haunted
By a [G7]memory of a [D7]love that cannot [G7]be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You’re [C]happy with another who’s [F]love you’d rather share
And [D7]all the while my hungry heart [G7]is crying in despair
Someday you’ll [C]wake up and find you’re [D7]somebody’s used to be
Then you’ll [G7]know that you’re unwanted just like [C]me
Repeat 
{end_of_verse}
