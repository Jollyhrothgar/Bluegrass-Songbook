{start_of_verse}
Have you ever been to the head or the holler
That’s where the big dogs romp and waller
The women there are long and lean
And some I fear are apt to be mean
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Roll on head out
You’ll like it there’s no doubt
There ain’t no better place to be
Than the head of the holler in Kentucky
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
The first time I went to the head of the holler
I wore a bow tie and a snow white collar
When daylight came come crawlin’ in
And the best thing I wore was a silly grin
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
The next time I went to the head of the holler
I saw more moon that I could swaller
I flew like a bird and a tryin to sing
‘Til I fell from a tree and broke one wing
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Now my gal lives in the head of the holler
Her love shines like a silver dollar
She feeds me butter staight from the churn
And her ma and pa don’t give a durn
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I’m a going back to the head of the holler
You can go too if you want to follow
But don’t you fool with that gal of mine
I’ll cut you down like a lonesome pine
{end_of_verse}
