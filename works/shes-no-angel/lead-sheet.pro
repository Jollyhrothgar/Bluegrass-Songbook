{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
You [A]see her there at the bar cross [E7]the room
She looks like an angel with her paint and [A]perfume
You’d like to meet her your [A7]conscience [D]says no
Obey [E7]your conscience turn around [A]and go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
She’s [D]no angel, no angel, her wings are [A]not real
She’ll [E]ruin your life if your [E7]heart she [A]can [A7]steal
She’ll [D]tell you tales to bring tears to [A]your eyes
But [E]don’t you believe them [E7]for they’re [A]only lies
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You [A]think if only she could be [E7]your own
You’d be more contented than a king on his [A]throne
You’d better not trust her [A7]it’s wrong if [D]you do
She’s [E7]broken many hearts and she’ll break [A]yours too
{end_of_verse}
