{start_of_verse}
At the end of day when works all over
And the shadows of night settle down
My thoughts turn back to the one that loved me
My sweetheart and my home town
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
There’s a dear one dear one waiting
Waiting back in my home town
It’s a sweet one called my missess
Waiting back in my home town
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
We once walked to church on Sunday morning
All of our friends gathered round
I will meet her again to be wed at the altar
When I get back to my home town
{end_of_verse}
