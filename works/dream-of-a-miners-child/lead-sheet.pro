{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
A [C]miner [F]was leaving [C]his home for his work
When [C]he heard [D7]his little [G7]child scream
He [C]went to [F]the side of [C]the little child’s bed
She [C]said daddy [G7]I’ve had [C]such a dream
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Oh [C]daddy [C7]don’t go to [F]the [C]mines today
For [C]dreams have so often [G]come true
Oh [C]daddy [F]oh daddy [C]please don’t go away
For [C]I never [G7]could live [C]without you
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [C]dreamed that the [F]mines were [C]all flaming with fire
And [C]the miners [D7]all fought for [G7]their lives
Just [C]then the [F]scene changed and [C]the mouth of the mine
Was [C]covered [G7]with [C]sweethearts and wives
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Go [C]down to [F]the village [C]and tell all your friends
That [C]as sure as [D7]the bright sun [G7]does shine
There’s [C]something a [F]going to [C]happen there today
Oh [C]daddy [C7]don’t [F]go to [C]the mine
{end_of_verse}
