{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]While the tiny drops of [C]rain
Race [G]down [D7]my window[G]pane
There's a flood of loneli[C]ness
Running [G]wild inside [D7]of me
My [G]hand reaches for the [C]phone
Dials the [G]number [D7]at your [G]home
To [C]beg you once [G]again to [D7]slip [G]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Though I know that it's not [C]fair
That the [G]one [D7]who's with you [G]there
Buys the slippers that [C]you leave beneath [D7]my bed
Slip the [G]ring from your [C]finger
And [G]quickly [D7]after [G]dinner
Make [C]some excuse [G]and darlin [D7]slip [G]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[D7]Slip [G]away for just an [C]hour
Let me [G]live [D7]for just a [G]minute
Everything in me is [C]wanting
To [G]hold you once [D7]again
Stealing [G]minutes [C]hours [G]days
[C]I just [G]start to [D7]hear you [G]say
I [C]love you [G]so darlin' [D7]slip [G]away
Repeat last verse
{end_of_verse}
