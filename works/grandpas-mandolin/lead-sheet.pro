{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Looking through old memories in my cedar [A]closet stashed away
I [E]found the old mandolin [B7]Grandpa used to play
I [E]picked it up and held it [A]close thinking ’bout those years ago
And [E]all the great [B7]music [E]Grandpa made
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Weathered worn but never frail with [A]calloused hands he gently played
To [E]bring an easy feeling to a [B7]hard working day
When [E]times were tough as they could be he [A]never once complained to me
He’d [E]just let [B7]the music sooth the [E]the pain
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
When [C#m]Grandpa played [A]the [E]mandolin [B7]the family [E]gathered ’round
To [A]sing the old time [E]songs generations [B7]handed down
I [A]remember every [G#m]single phrase [C#m]from every [A]song he played
Wish I could [F#m]sing a song [B7]with [E]Grandpa today
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I recall 1961 the [A]year Grandpa passed away
The [E]family gathered ’round once more to [B7]sing Amazing Grace
Now this [E]mandolin’s reminding me [A]of what my Grandpa taught to me
That [E]music makes the [B7]world a [E]better place
{end_of_verse}
