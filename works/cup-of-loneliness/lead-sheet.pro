{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I see Christian pilgrims so redeemed from sin
[D7]Called out of darkness a [C]new life to [G]begin
Were you ever in the valley when the way is dark and dim
[D7]Did you ever drink the cup of [C]loneliness with [G]Him
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Did you ever have them laugh at you and say it was a fake
[D7]The stand that you so boldly [C]for the Lord did [G]take
Did they ever mock at you and laugh in ways quite grim
[D7]Did you ever drink the cup of [C]loneliness with [G]Him
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Did you ever try to preach then hold fast and pray
[D7]And even when you did it there [C]did not seem a [G]way
And you lost all courage then lost all your vim
[D7]Did you ever drink the cup of [C]loneliness with [G]Him
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Oh my friends 'tis bitter sweet while here on earthly sod
[D7]To follow in the footsteps that [C]our dear Savior [G]trod
To suffer with the Savior and when the way is dark and dim
[D7]To drink of the bitter cup of [C]loneliness with [G]Him
{end_of_verse}
