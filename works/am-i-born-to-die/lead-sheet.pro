{start_of_verse}
And am I born to die
To lay this body down
And as my trembling spirit fly
Unto a world unknown
{end_of_verse}

And as my trembling spirit fly
Unto a world unknown
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Soon as from earth I go
What will become of me
Eternal happiness far away
Must then my portion be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Eternal happiness far away
Must then my portion be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
A land of deepest shade
Unpierced by human thought
That weary region of the dead
Where all things are forgot
{end_of_verse}

That weary region of the dead
Where all things are forgot
