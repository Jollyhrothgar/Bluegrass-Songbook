{start_of_verse}
Don’t feel blue when I tell you I’m leavin
Please don’t cry now when I set you free
Though I know that my heart will be breakin
I’ll get by don’t you cry over me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
When that cold rain is fallin outside dear
And you’re happy far over the sea
Don’t be thinkin of me in my sorrow
I’ll get by don’t you cry over me
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
No don’t shed any tears they’d be wasted
Our love it was never meant to be
That’s why I don’t want you to worry
I’ll get by don’t you cry over me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I knew all the time you weren’t happy
That someday I’d have to set you free
So forget about me and my troubles
I’ll get by don’t you cry over me
{end_of_verse}
