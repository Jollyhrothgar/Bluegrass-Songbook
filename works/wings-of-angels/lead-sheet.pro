{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
A [A]child [D]was born to be [A]our Savior
Wise [A]men came from near [E]and far
To [A]see [D]the Jesus in [A]the manger
The [A]pathway [E]lighted by [A]the [A7]stars
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Someday [D]he’ll wake me from [A]the dead
No [A]more I’ll sleep there all [E]alone
But [D]carried up to Him [A]on high
On [E]the wings of angels [A]headed home
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
They [A]crucified [D]our Lord [A]and Savior
He [A]humbly died there on [E]the cross
That [A]we [D]might someday rise [A]and join Him
Our [A]souls [E]be saved and not [A]be [A7]lost
{end_of_verse}
