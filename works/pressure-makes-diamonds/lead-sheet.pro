{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Well we've had our [G7]troubles [F]we've had our hard [C]times
Where some might have [G7]stumbled [F]we've always [C]survived
Sometimes love [Am]weakens [F]when the chips are all [C]down
But what we've got [G7]together [F]gets stronger [C]somehow
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Pressure makes [F]diamonds much harder than [C]stone
And they only get [G7]finer [F]as each day goes [C]on
Been through some [F]bad times but we made it [C]somehow
Cause if pressure makes [G7]diamonds [F]our love's a [G7]diamond by [C]now
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well we know the [G7]feeling [F]when the world closes [C]in
We've been there [G7]before love [F]and we might go [C]again
The road may get [Am]rocky [F]life may get [C]hard
But the whole world [G7]together [F]can't tear us [C]apart
