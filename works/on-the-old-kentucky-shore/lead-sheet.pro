{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I [F]walked out to the graveyard
Down by the [Bb]Church [F]of God
I looked [Bb]upon [F]the one I love
That would soon be [C]covered [F]with sod
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Up [F]along the Ohio [F7]River
Over [Bb]on the old [F]Kentucky shore
Once dwelled a [C]fair [F]young maiden
Now there’s a crepe [C]upon [F]her door
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The [F]angels took my darling
God [Bb]needed the one [F]I loved
I [F]reached the old Kentucky shore today
I’ll make my plans and [C]meet her [F]up above
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The [F]last words that my darling said
Was tell the [Bb]one I love [F]goodbye
I [F]would like to see him before I go
But I’ll meet him [C]in [F]the sky
{end_of_verse}
