{start_of_verse}
Well that last train done left town
The last train done left town
I heard the whistle moaning low
But that last train done left town.  Hoo-hooo-ooooo.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Now my sweet baby’s on that train
My sweet baby’s on that train
I wonder if I will see her again
But that last train’s done gone down.  Hoo-hooo-ooooo.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Now the whistle’s moaning low
The whistle is moaning low
I begged my baby please don’t go
But that last train’s done gone down.  Hoo-hooo-ooooo.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Now I’m sorry for what I’ve done
I’m sorry for what I’ve done
To leave behind your baby crying
But that last train’s done gone down.  Hoo-hooo-ooooo.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Well that last train done left town
The last train done left town
I heard the whistle moaning low
But that last train done left town.  Hoo-hooo-hooo-hoo-hoo.
