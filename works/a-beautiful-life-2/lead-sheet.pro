{start_of_verse}
Each day I’ll do a golden deed
By helping those who are in need
My life on earth is but a span
And so I’ll do the best I can
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Life’s evening sun is sinking low
A few more days and I must go
To meet the deeds that I have done
Where there will be no setting sun
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
To be a child of God each day
My life must shine along the way
I’ll sing His praise while the ages roll
And strive to help some troubled soul
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
While going down life’s weary road
I’ll try to lift some traveler’s load
I’ll try to turn the night to day
Make flowers bloom along the way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
The only life that will endure
Is one that’s kind and good and pure
And so for God, I’ll take my stand
Each day I’ll lend a helping hand
{end_of_verse}
