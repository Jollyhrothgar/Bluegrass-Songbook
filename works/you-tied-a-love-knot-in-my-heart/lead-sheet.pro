{start_of_verse}
You tied a love knot in my heart dear
When you said you’d be my bride
Oh how well I remember
As we strolled side by side
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Leaves were falling all around us
Roses withered on the ground
You tied a love knot in my heart dear
That can never be unwound
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
The only thing that I have left now
Is this little string I’ve found
With a little love knot in it
That she held tight in her hand
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
As I stood there by your bedside
As I looked into your eyes
You tied a love knot in my heart dear
That can never be untied
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
There’s a heart tonight that’s lonely
There’s a heart tonight that’s sad
For God has took you from me
The best pal I ever had
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
She’s gone to sing up in heaven
God needed her there by His side
You tied a love knot in my heart dear
That can never be untied
{end_of_verse}
