{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
There’s a [G]little [D7]rosewood [F#]casket[G]
Resting [G]on [D7]a [F#]marble [G]stand
With a [G]packet [C]of old [G]love letters
Written [D7]by [F#]my true [G]love’s hand
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Go [G]and bring [D7]them [F#]to [G]me sister
Read [G]them o’er [D7]for [F#]me [G]tonight
I have [G]often [C]tried [G]but could not
For the [D7]tears [F#]that [G]filled my eyes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
When I’m [D7]dead [F#]and in [G]my casket
When I [D7]gently [F#]fall [G]asleep
Fall [G]asleep to [C]wake [G]in heaven
Dearest [D7]sister [F#]do [G]not weep
Take his [G]letters [D7]and [F#]his [G]locket
Place them [G]gently [D7]on [F#]my [G]heart
But this [G]golden [C]ring that [G]he gave me
From my [D7]finger [F#]never [G]part
{end_of_verse}
