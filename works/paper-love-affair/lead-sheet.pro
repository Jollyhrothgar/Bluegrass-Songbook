{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[D7]Your love for [G]me was just a paper love [D7]affair
So we stood side by side and you whispered I [G]do
You made those vows and our names are written [D7]there
But darling how you lied when you said I [G]love you

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You made those [C]vows again and [G]again you signed your name
My paper [A7]love affair is just a license in a [D7]frame
I'll keep it [G]there even though we're far [D7]apart
My paper love affair will live forever in my [G]heart
{end_of_verse}
