{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
There’s an old and faded [D]picture on [G]the wall
That has been a hanging there for [C]many [G]years
It’s a [C]picture my mother
For I [G]know there is no other
That can take the place of [D]mother on [G]the wall
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
On the wall (on the wall) [C]on [G]the wall (on the wall)
How I love that dear old picture on the [D]wall
Time is [G]swiftly passing by
And I [C]bow my head and cry
Cause [G]I know I’ll see [D]my mother [G]after all
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Yes the children all [D]have gathered all [G]have gone
And I have a little family [C]of [G]my own
And I [C]know I love them well
More than [G]any tongue can tell
But I’ll hold that dear old [D]picture on [G]the wall
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Since I lost that dear old [D]mother years [G]ago
There is none to which with troubles [C]I [G]can go
As my [C]guitar makes its chords
I am [G]praying to the Lord
Let me hold that dear old [D]picture on [G]the wall
{end_of_verse}
