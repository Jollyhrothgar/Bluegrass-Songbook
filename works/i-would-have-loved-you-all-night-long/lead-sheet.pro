{start_of_verse: Verse 1}

For some things feel so right at night
And in the [D7]morning feels so [G7]wrong

Last [C]night I saw me in your eyes

And [C]taken more of [G7]you

Then [C]perhaps instead of lettin' go
You'd [F]still be hangin' [C]on

I would have [G7]loved you all night [C]long
{end_of_verse}

And the [F]wrinkles from your [C]clothes
And as you move around the room

I would have [G7]loved you all night [C]long
{end_of_verse}
