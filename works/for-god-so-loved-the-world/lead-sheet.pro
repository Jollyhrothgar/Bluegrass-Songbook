{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]As the Savior was [C]walking up [G]Calvary's Hill
All the [D7]birds hushed their singing
The [G]leaves all stood still
All the flowers in the [C]fields
Bowed their [G]lovely heads
While the [D7]Savior to Calvary was [G]led[G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Tell me [C]why oh tell me why
Did Jesus [G]die on Calvary
Tell me why did He [A7]suffer such ago[D7]ny
For [G]God so loved the [G7]world
That He [C]gave His only Son
And that is [G]why Jesus [A7]died for [D7]you and [G]me
([C]You and [G]me)
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
They put nails in His [C]hands
Pierced His [G]precious side
And the [D7]pain was so great
That [G]tears filled His eyes
Yet He spoke not a [C]word 
Till the [G]last breath He drew
Then He [D7]prayed they know not what they [G]do[G7]
{end_of_verse}

Tell me [C]why oh tell me why
Did Jesus [G]die on Calvary
Tell me why did He [A7]suffer such ago[D7]ny
For [G]God so loved the [G7]world
That He [C]gave His only Son
And that is [G]why Jesus [A7]died for [D7]you and [G]me 
([C]You and [G]me)
