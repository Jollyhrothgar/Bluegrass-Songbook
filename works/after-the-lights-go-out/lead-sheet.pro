{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Tonight I'm [C]out with the [G]crowd
I'm out where the [D7]music's playing [G]loud
And I'm hidin' all the [C]memories we [G]knew
But it won't be long till [D7]I'll be missin' [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Cause after the lights go out your pillow starts [D7]talkin'
All I can hear in my ears are the words I love [G]you
I'll jump to my feet and slowly start [C]walkin'
Memories in the [G]dark tear at my [D7]heart after the lights go [G]out
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The daybreak finally [C]comes I'm feelin' [G]better
For the sun helps to [D7]dry the tears [G]away
And pretty soon now I'll get [C]all my thoughts [G]together
In the busy and the [D7]worries of the [G]day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Cause after the lights go out your pillow starts [D7]talkin'
All I can hear in my ears are the words I love [G]you
I'll jump to my feet and slowly start [C]walkin'
Memories in the [G]dark tear at my [D7]heart after the lights go [G]out
{end_of_verse}
