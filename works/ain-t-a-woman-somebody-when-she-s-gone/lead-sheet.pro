{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I ran into her today [F]not quite by [C]accident
Someone told me where she’d be and [D7]that’s where I [G7]went
She still [C]looked the same there was no [F]change that I could [C]see
Then I [G7]realized as I watched her there’s been a change in [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
All at once she’s a [F]queen 
And a dream and a sweet voice calling me [C]baby
She’s got misty eyes she’s the right [Am]size 
She’s the [D7]worlds most beautiful [G7]lady
I can [C]see her now the way [F]she was all [C]along
Ain’t a woman somebody [G7]when she’s [C]gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
There was someone else beside [F]her where I used to [C]be
As I watched her holding close [D7]I thought that could be [G7]me
Too [C]late I see love [F]has to be both give and [C]take
And I let [G7]her do all the giving oh what a big [C]mistake
