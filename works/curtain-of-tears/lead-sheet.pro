The memory of you by my [G7]side
A memory of someone unfaithful
You trifled you cheated you [C]lied

You left me behind with my sorrow
Along with all of my [G7]things
I’m standing on stage of sorrow
Behind this curtain of [C]tears
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
A curtain of tears are falling one by [G7]one
The lines in my face are emotion
Rolling with the wrongs of your [C]fun
To think I loved someone so foolish

I’m standing on stage of sorrow
Behind this curtain of [C]tears
