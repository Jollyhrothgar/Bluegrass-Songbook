{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]When I think of my childhood [C]days
Growing [D7]up in the small town a [G]USA
The fondest of my many [C]memo[D7]ries 
Is that [G]front porch rocking [C]chair
And [D7]all of us children [G]gathered there
Waiting our turn to [C]climb up on mama's [D7]knee
With [C]her imagi[D7]nation [G]around the [D7]world she'd [Em]take us
[D7]With the [C]stories of the places she [D7]knew we'd never see
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
In mama's [C]rocking chair she could [G]take us anywhere
To a [D7]tropical island or a snow covered mountain
Or a [G]desert caravan
We sailed the ocean we [C]climbed the Eifel Tower
We went a [G]million miles an hour
We traveled [D7]everywhere [C]  in mama's [G]rocking chair
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I've got a wife and some kids of my [C]own
Every [D7]Saturday morning they sit at [G]home
Gathered around their [C]eyes glued to the tv [D7]screen
[C]Around the world they [D7]go in living [G]color and [D7]stere[Em]o
But [D7]they may [C]never get to know 
The thrill [D7]imagination brings
