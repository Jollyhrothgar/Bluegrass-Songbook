{start_of_verse}
There’s an old broken lock on the old cabin door
The cracks and the holes in your cabin floor
It’s a tumbled down shack how I long to go back
And dwell in that shack evermore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Peace peace the valley of peace
Where no sorrows are known
Like a heaven yes heaven to me it seems
Peace the valley my home
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
Though an old broken window
the light brightly shines
It twinkles and shines through the honeysuckle vines
By the old rustic well is my sweet little Nell
And for me I know how she pines
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
In the parlor a fire is burning so bright
The old rocking chair is empty tonight
That tumbled down shack is a palace to me
And that’s where I’m longing to be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
* Refrain
{end_of_verse}
