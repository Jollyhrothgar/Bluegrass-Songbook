{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I ain't slept in seven days, [C]haven't ate in [G]three
[G]Methamphetamine has got a damn good hold of [D]me
[G]My tweaker friends have got me to the [C]point of no re[G]turn
[G]I just took the lighter to the [D]bulb and watched it [G]burn
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
[C]This life of sin [G]This life of sin
[C]Is got me in [G]Is got me in
[D]Well it's got me back in prison once again
[G]I used my only phone call to [C]contact my daddy
[G]I got twenty long years for some [D]dust in a [G]baggie
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G]Well if I would have listened to what [C]Mom and Papa [G]said,
[G]I wouldn't be locked up in prison, troubled in the [D]head
[G]I took that little pop and [C]sucked until my mind was [G]spun
[G]I got twenty years to sit and [D]think of what I've [G]done
{end_of_verse}

{chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G]Well sometimes I sit and wonder where my [C]little life went [G]wrong,
[G]These old jailhouse blues have got me singing this old [D]song
[G]My life is a disaster, Lord, and [C]I feel so a[G]shamed
[G]In here where they call by a [D]number, not a [G]name
{end_of_verse}
