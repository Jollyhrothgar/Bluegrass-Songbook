{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
In [E]this fair land you’ll stay no more
Here [B]labor is [E]in vain
You’ll leave the [B]mountains of our [A]birth
And seek the fertile [E]plains
You’re [B]going to the [E]west
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
You [E]say you will not go with me
You [B]turn your eyes [E]away
You say you [B]will not [A]follow me
No matter what I [E]say
I’m [B]going to the [E]west
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The [E]years have passed since we first met
When [B]you became my [E]bride
Now I must [B]journey far [A]away
Without you by my [E]side
I’m [B]going to the [E]west
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
You’ll [E]leave me here, in this land I love
Mid [B]scenes so bright and [E]fair
Where [B]fragrant flowers are [A]blooming
And music fills the [E]air
You’re [B]going to the [E]west
{end_of_verse}
