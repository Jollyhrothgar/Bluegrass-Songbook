{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I’ve [G]been away for just a year
Have you forgotten me my [D7]dear
The judge said [G]I [C]must pay [G]the cost
I [D7]never knew how much [G]I lost
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Until they [C]send me [G]far away
Where each minute seems a [D7]day
But maybe [G]someday [C]I’ll [G]be free
Will you be [D7]waiting there [G]for me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I’m in this cell because of you
The crime I did you drove me [D7]too
My jealous [G]heart [C]just could [G]not stand
To see you [D7]with [G]another man
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I hope someday that you will learn
And broken hearted you [D7]return
But listen [G]darlin’ [C]please [G]don’t wait
For maybe [D7]then will be [G]too late
{end_of_verse}
