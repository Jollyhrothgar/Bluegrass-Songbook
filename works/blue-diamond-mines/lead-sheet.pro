{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I remember the ways and [F]the bygone days
When [G]we were [F]all in [G]our prime
How us and John L. we gave [F]the old man hell
Down [G]in the [F]Blue [G]Diamond Mine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
When the whistle blowed and the [F]rooster crowed
Two [G]hours [F]before [G]daylight
When a man done his best and [F]he earned a good rest
And [G]had [F]seventeen dollars [G]at night
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
In the mines in the [F]mines
In the [G]Blue [C]Diamond Mines
I’ve [G]worked my (whole-1*) [F](poor-2*) (– [G]-3*) life away
In the mines in the [F]mines
In [G]the Blue [C]Diamond Mine
Go [G]fall on your [F]knees [G]and pray.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
You old black gold you’ve [F]taken my lungs
And your [G]dust [F]has darkened [G]my home
And now that we’re old you’re [F]turning your back
But [G]where else can [F]an old [G]miner go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
It’s  Algoma Block and it’s [F]Big Leatherwood
And [G]now it’s [F]Blue [G]Diamond too
The pits they are closing [F]get another job
But [G]what else [F]can an old [G]miner do
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
John L. had a dream but it’s [F]broken it seems
And the union is letting us down
Last night they took away my hospital card
Saying why don’t you leave this old town.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
So I’ll go downtown and I’ll hang around
And maybe it ain’t so bad
But when you get home your kids will meet you at the door
Saying what did you bring me dad
{end_of_verse}
