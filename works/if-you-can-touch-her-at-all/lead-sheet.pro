{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Funny a woman can come home so wild and [F]free
[G7]And insist I don't watch her undress or watch her watch [C]me
And stand by the bed and shiver as if she were [F]cold
[G7]Just to lie down beside me and touch me as if I were [C]gold
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
One night of love don't make up for six nights [F]alone
[G7]But I'd rather have one than none Lord cause I'm flesh and [C]bone
Sometimes it seems that she ain't worth the trouble at [F]all
[G7]But she could be worth the world if somehow you can touch her at [C]all
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Right or wrong a woman can own any [F]man
[G7]She can take him inside her and hold his soul in her [C]hand
And leave him as weary and weak as a newborn [F]child
[G7]Fighting to catch his first breath and open [C]his eyes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
One night of love don't make up for six nights [F]alone
[G7]But I'd rather have one than none Lord cause I'm flesh and [C]bone
Sometimes it seems that she ain't worth the trouble at [F]all
[G7]But she could be worth the world if somehow you can touch her at [C]all
{end_of_verse}
