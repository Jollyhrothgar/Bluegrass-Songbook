{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Oh [G]somewhere the music’s playing soft and [D]low
And [D]a stranger holds the one that I [G]love so
I was blind I could not see that you meant the world to me
But [D]like a fool I stood and watched [G]you go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Now [G]I’m crying my heart out [D]over you
Those [Am]blue eyes now [D]they smile at [G]someome new
Ever since you went away I die a little more each day
For [G]I’m crying my heart out [D]over you
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Each [G]night I climb the stairs up to [D]my room
It [D]seems I hear you whisper in the [G]gloom
I miss your picture on the wall and your footsteps in the hall
While I’m [D]crying my heart out [G]over you.
{end_of_verse}
