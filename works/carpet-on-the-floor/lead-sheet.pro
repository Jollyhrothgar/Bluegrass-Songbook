{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]There's a path that is worn in the [C]carpet on the [G]floor
By the window where I watch and wait for [D7]you
I'm a [G]prisoner alone in a [C]cell that once was [G]home
And there's no one to talk to [D7]but the [G]blues
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh the [C]carpet on the floor it's [G]tattered and tore
And tears I've cried enough to flood the [D7]sea
Things that's [G]loved the most by man
Are tossed [C]about like a grain of [G]sand
And lost just like the love you [D7]had for [G]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Till I'm too feeble to walk till I [C]grow too weak to [G]talk
Till my eyes grow dim and I no longer [D7]see
I still [G]walk along alone prayin' [C]for you to come [G]home
Till the last breath of life has [D7]gone from [G]me
{end_of_verse}

Are tossed [C]about like a grain of [G]sand
And lost just like the love you [D7]had for [G]me
