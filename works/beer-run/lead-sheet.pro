{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Twenty-five minutes past quitting time
Seven of us crammed into that [D7]truck of [G]mine
Paying no attention to them highway signs
Doing ninety miles an hour toward the [D7]county [G]line
Oh [C]quick sack [B7]twelve pack [A#7]back [A7]again
It's a [G]B double E double [D7]R U [G]N
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
My buddies and their babies letting down their hair
As long as we're together it don't [D7]matter [G]where
Ain't got a lot of money but we just don't care
Knowing half the fun is [D7]getting [G]there
[C]Aztec [B7]long-necks [A#7]paychecks [A7]spent
Oh it's a [G]B double E double [D7]R U [G]N
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I [B7]can't stop thinking what the hell they were drinking
When they [Em]made this county dry
I got a [B7]week long thirst and to make it worse
[C]Lord it's my turn to [D7]drive
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Oh [G]laughing and a bragging and a carrying on
We loaded up the wagons and we [D7]headed [G]home
I guess a half a dozen cases doesn't last that long
Come tomorrow morning it'll [D7]be all [G]gone
Then it's [C]turn around [B7]leave town [A#7]sounds [A7]again
Like a [G]B double E double [D7]R U [G]N
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Like a B double E double [D7]R U [G]N
{end_of_verse}
