{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I think I'll go across the ocean
If I don't change the notion
I've just got to [D7]forget you if I [G]can

For I'm head over [D7]heels in love with [G]you
{end_of_verse}

Every day is sad and lonely
For I'm thinking of you only
I just can't [D7]sleep in early [G]down

For I'm head over [D7]heels in love with [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Oh I'd like to be forgiven
But this life ain't worth living
If have to sit and [D7]worry over [G]you

For I'm head over [D7]heels in love with [G]you
{end_of_verse}

Oh the nights are long and dreary
All I do is sit and worry
I just can't bear the [D7]thought of loosing [G]you

For I'm head over [D7]heels in love with [G]you
