{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]That lonely night we got carried away with each [G7]other
[C]Remains with me though there'll never be [G7]another
Warm [C]drinks soft lights slow [F]dances
When [C]two blue people were the victim [G7]of [C]circumstances
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Circumstances the wrong arms the [G7]right time
Circumstances was it charms or just [C]the wine
Would it happen again if we had enough [F]chances
Or would we even want [C]each other under [G7]different [C]circumstances
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
What is done is over and just a [G7]memory
The [C]night they set a sign for you and [G7]me
Oh but the [C]dreams this foolish heart [F]romances
When [C]two blue people were the victim [G7]of [C]circumstances
{end_of_verse}
