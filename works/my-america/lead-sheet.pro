{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]She lies asleep in the snow capped peaks [C7]of the Tetons and Yellow[F]stone
She [G7]sings to me of sad memories of the days when the buffalo [C]roamed
A white faced cow is grazing now on the [C7]plains where the longhorns [F]trod
And [G7]the red skinned man has a calloused hand from turning Oklahoma [C]sod
Hear the deadly sound of a cannon round [C7]as she sets her people [F]free
Where [G7]brave men died to protect her rights make a place for you and [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And now I [F]love to gaze at the [G7]color change in her [F]hills of Tenne[C]ssee
Or to [F]smell the rain on her [G7]sun baked plains 
With a good horse between my [C]knees
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I hear the ghostly strain of a wagon train 
As the [C7]desert takes it's [F]toll
The [G7]lives she gave was the price she paid for the walls of the Ala[C]mo
As steel rails rolled towards her western coast 
[C7]She's moving her people [F]on
Now [G7]the buildings high dot her western skies 
The moving keeps her people [C]strong
Brave men make America great just [C7]look what they have [F]done
And [G7]I'm proud to say that the Lord has made me one of Americas [C]sons
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And now I [F]love to gaze at the [G7]color change in her [F]hills of Tenne[C]ssee
Or to [F]smell the rain on her [G7]sun baked plains 
With a good horse between my [C]knees
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
The sweet [F]smell of rain on her [G7]sun baked plains 
With a good horse between my [C]knees
{end_of_verse}
