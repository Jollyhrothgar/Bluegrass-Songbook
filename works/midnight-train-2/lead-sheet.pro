{start_of_verse}
No matter what I say or do you’re never satisfied
I’ve tried and tried so many times I’m leavin you now good bye
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
I’m ridin on that midnight train my head’s a hangin low
These awful blues will follow me where ever I may go
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
Oh why on earth was I ever born I’ll never understand
To fall in love with a woman like you in love with another man
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
You broke a heart that trusted you why wasn’t it made of stone
I’m left in a world black as night, yet I must journey on
{end_of_verse}
