{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]All my tears have fallen I can [G7]cry no more
I've cried so much since you have said good[C]bye
The pressure keeps on building up [G7]within my heart
It grows and grows but still my eyes are [C]dry
Though my heart is breakin' tears re[G7]fuse to start
So I've got to find a new way to [C]cry
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]I've got to find a new way to relieve the [C]pain
It just can't stay forever locked in[G7]side
[C]And until I forget you and can [G7]smile again
I've got to find a new way to [C]cry
{end_of_verse}
