{start_of_chorus}
The [F]darkest hour [C]is just before dawn
The [C]narrow way [G7]leads home
Lay [C]down your soul [F]at [C]Jesus’ feet
The [F]darkest hour [C]is just before dawn
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
The [C]sun is [F]slowly sinking
The [C]day [G7]is [C]almost gone
Still [C]darkness [F]falls around us
And [C]we [G7]must [C]journey on
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Like [C]a shepherd out on [F]the mountain
A [C]watching [G7]the sheep [C]down below
He’s [C]coming back [F]to claim us
Will [C]you [G7]be ready [C]to go
{end_of_verse}
