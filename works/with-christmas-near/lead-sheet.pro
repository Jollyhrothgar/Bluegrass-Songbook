{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]At this time of year with Christmas [F]time so near
I start to [G7]hear those songs that make me [C]blue
Songs about the snow and the [F]mistletoe 
Every[G7]where I go there's memories of [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Again for me this year there'll be no [F]Christmas cheer
Until [G7]I'm free and your memory disa[C]ppears
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
There's a Christmas tree where it [F]used to be
But the [G7]lights have all burned out some time [C]ago
There's no Christmas card yet the [F]hardest part
Is the [G7]fear that I won't see you any[C]more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Again for me this year there'll be no [F]Christmas cheer
Until [G7]I'm free and your memory disa[C]ppears
{end_of_verse}
