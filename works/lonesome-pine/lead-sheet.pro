{start_of_verse}
I’m lonesome pine on the mountain
All alone I find no one by my side
Oh I wish I had me a dogwood tree
That would bloom beside me for company
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I’m lonesome so lonesome I’ll never know why
I must stand all alone till the day that die
I’ll never get over this sorrow of mine
This evergreen sorrow from the lonesome pine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
In the summertime when the wind blows free
There’s a mournful song in the heart of me
It’s the saddest song that you’ll ever hear
For the lonesome pine will you shed a tear
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
In the wintertime when the snow falls down
And my branches drop till they touch the ground
You can hear me groan with the load I bear
For its mine all alone no one seems to care
{end_of_verse}
