{start_of_verse}
That night we parted long ago
I vowed my love I’d never show
Sweetheart I find that I can’t hide
My love beneath this foolish pride
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
If I could hold you one more time
And kiss the lips that once were mine
It would ease this aching hearrt of mine
If you would say you love me one more time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Oh won’t you take me back once more
Give me the love I’m longing for
It would ease this aching heart of mine
If you would say you love me one more time
{end_of_verse}
