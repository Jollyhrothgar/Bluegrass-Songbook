{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]You’re breaking in another heart to take the place of [D7]mine
The [F]kind of love I [C]gave to you is [D7]very hard to [G7]find
You’re [C]breaking in another heart to try to take my [D7]place
But [F]have I left a [C]memory that time [G7][F]cannot [C]erase
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G7]Can you find another one who’ll love you like I [C]do
[G7]One who thinks you’re everything [D7]his world is only [G7]you
[C]Now that you have made the change I don’t think you will [D7]find
The [F]heart that you are [C]breaking in will be [F]as true [G7]as [C]mine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G7]When you made him love you so and taught him what to [C]be
[G7]I wonder when you kiss his [D7]lips will you think of [G7]me
[C]It’s hard to start my life again but what else can [D7]I do
You’re [F]breaking in [C]another heart but [F]mine you’ve [G7]broke [C]into 
{end_of_verse}
