{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]On a park bench in the middle of July 
We sat and watched the children [D7]play
If it was the heat or the noise 
He didn't have too much to [G]say

Then with a move of his eyes 
A move that would have made the wind [C]stand still[Am]
He took my [G]hand in his and said the [D7]words 
That I never will [G]forget

Has there been some[G]one else
Is there someone you [D7]love more than me 
Someone you can't [G]forget
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Get his memory in the [C]open again 
Let it be chased away by [G]time
He said have you ever [D7]cheated on me 
And I said [C]only in my [G]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}

Is it you or the [G]heat
