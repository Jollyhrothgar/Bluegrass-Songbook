{start_of_chorus}
Nobody’s love is like [C]mine
No [G]one’s as faithful [D]and kind
Love [G]that is true [C]as the ocean
Nobody’s love is like [C]mine.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
They tell me little darling that you [C]are leaving
That [G]you’re going [D]far away
Why [G]did you leave me [C]little darling
I [G]loved [D]you both night [G]and day.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I guess I’ll just go on [C]dreaming
Wondering [G]why you [D]left me
Someday [G]little darling you’ll [C]be sorry
For [G]the [D]way you [G]treated me.
{end_of_verse}
