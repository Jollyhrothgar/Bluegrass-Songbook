{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
When the [C]whistle blows each morning
And I [G7]walk down in this cold [C]dark mine.
I say a [C]prayer to my dear savior
Please let [G7]me see the sunshine one [C]more day.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
When [F]oh when will it [C]be over
When [F]will I lay these [G]burdens down?
And when [C]I die dear Lord in Heaven
Please take [G7]my soul from beneath that cold [C]dark ground.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I still [C]grieve for my poor brother
And I still [G7]hear my dear old [C]mother cry
When late [C]that night they came and told her
He’d lost [G7]his life down in that Big [C]Shoal mine.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I have [C]no shame I feel no sorrow
If on [G7]this earth not [C]much I own
Cause I [C]have the love of my sweet children
An old plow [G7]mule a shovel and [C]a hoe.
{end_of_verse}
