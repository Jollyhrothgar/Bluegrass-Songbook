{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Your love is as cold as a north [F]wind [C]blowing
And the river that [G7]runs to the [C]sea
How can I go on when your [F]only love is [C]gone
I can see this is [G7]no place for [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The light in your eye is [G7]still shining
It shines but it [F]don't shine for [C]me
It's a story so old [F]another love grown [C]cold
I can see this is [G7]no place for [C]me
