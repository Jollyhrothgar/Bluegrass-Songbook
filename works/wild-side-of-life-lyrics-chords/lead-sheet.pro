{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]You wouldn't read my letter if [F]I wrote you
You [G7]asked me not to call you on [C]the phone
But there's something I'm wanting [F]to tell you
So I [G7]wrote it in the words of [C]this song
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I didn't know God made honky tonk [F]angels
I [G7]should have known you'd never make [C]a wife
You gave up the only one that ever [F]loved you
And went [G7]back to the wild side [C]of life
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The glamor of the gay night life has [F]lured you
To the [G7]places where the wine and liquor [C]flows
There you wait to be anybodys [F]baby
And [G7]forget the only love you'll [C]ever know
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I didn't know God made honky tonk [F]angels
I [G7]should have known you'd never make [C]a wife
You gave up the only one that ever [F]loved you
And went [G7]back to the wild side [C]of life
{end_of_verse}
