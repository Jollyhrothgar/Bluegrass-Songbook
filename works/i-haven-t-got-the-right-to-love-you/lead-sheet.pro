{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Oh my dear I haven't got the right to [C]love you
Deep re[G]grets of yesterday still torture [D7]me
I wish I [G]didn't have to face this guilty [C]conscience
Like I [G]do each time I [D7]see you secret[G]ly
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [C]feel that I am stealing part of [G]heaven
Every time I hold you in my arms this [D7]way
Cause I [G]know I haven't got the right to [C]love you
While my [G]heart is bound by [D7]vows of yester[G]day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
It will be so hard for us to stay [C]apart dear
And con[G]demn this love that’s growing day by [D7]day
Though I [G]know I haven't got the right to [C]love you
Can I [G]ever tell my [D7]heart that it’s too [G]late
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I'd [C]give the world if only I could [G]hold you
Without feeling guilty of an awful [D7]crime
Though I [G]know I haven't got the right to [C]love you
In my [G]heart I can’t help [D7]feeling that you’re [G]mine
Repeat last verse
{end_of_verse}
