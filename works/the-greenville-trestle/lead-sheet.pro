{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I [D]remember as a [D7]boy how [G]in wonderment [D]and joy
I’d [D]watch the trains as they’d [A]go by
And the [D]whistle’s [D7]lonesome sound you [G]could here from [D]miles around
As they [D]rolled across that [A]Greenville [D]Trestle high.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
But [G]the whistles don’t [D]sound [D]like they [A]used to
Lately not many trains go by
Hard [D]times across the land mean [G]no work for a [D]railroad man
And the [D]Greenville Trestle [A]now don’t seem [D]so high.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
On [D]the riverbank I’d [D7]stand with [G]a cane pole [D]in my hand
And [D]watch the freight trains up against [A]the sky
With [D]the black smoke [D7]trailing back as [G]they moved [D]along the track
That [D]runs across that [A]Greenville [D]Trestle high.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
When [D]the lonesome whistles [D7]whined I’d [G]get rambling [D]on my mind
Lord [D]I wish they still sounded [A]that way
As [D]I turned to head [D7]for home Lord [G]she’d rumble [D]low and long
Toward [D]the sunset [A]at the close of [D]day.
{end_of_verse}
