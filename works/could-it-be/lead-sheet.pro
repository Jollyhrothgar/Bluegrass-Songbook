{start_of_verse}
I can tell by that far away look in your eye
That you’re waiting for a chance to be leaving
Where did I go wrong did I stay away too long
Did something come between us I don’t understand.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
I will run to where you are going
Any place you’re yearning to roam
But there’s something there you’re not showing
Could it be you don’t love me anymore
Could it be you don’t love me anymore.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
With this sweetest song
I would borrow the sun
And light up the world for you and me
Seems we’ve only just begun
you’re already on the run
And I didn’t even know the race was on.
{end_of_verse}
