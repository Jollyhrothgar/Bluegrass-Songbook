{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[Em]Ever since the days [G]of old men would [D7]search for wealth [Am]untold  
[Em]They dig for silver and for [G]gold and leave [D7]the empty [Am]holes  
And [Em]way down south in the [G]Everglades  
Where the black [D7]water rolls and the Saw grass [Am]waves  
[Em]The eagles fly and the [G]Otters play in the land [D7]of the [Am]Seminole  
{end_of_verse}

So [Em]blow blow [G]Seminole wind blow [D7]like your never gonna blow [Am]again  
[Em]I'm calling to you like a [G]long lost friend but I [D7]know who you [Am]are  
And [Em]blow blow from the [G]Okeechobee  all [D7]the way up to [Am]Micanopy  
[Em]Blow cross the home of the [G]Seminole the [D7]alligators and the [Am]Garr

[Em]Progress came and took [G]its toll and in the [D7]name of flood [Am]control  
They [Em]make their plans and they drained the [G]land  
[D7]Now the glades are going [Am]dry  
And the [Em]last time I walked in the [G]swamp I sat upon [D7]a cypress [Am]stump  
[Em]I listened close and I [G]heard the ghost of [D7]Osceola [Am]cry  
{end_of_verse}
