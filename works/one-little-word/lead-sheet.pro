{start_of_verse}
The dream of love is over
Today we said goodbye
We parted not in anger
Though tears came in her eyes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Twas just as fate decreed dear
That we must never wed
Yet in her heart she loved me
She married wealth instead
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
One little word could change my future life
One little word could have made her my wife
Too late too late now my fondest hopes are dead
One little word that word was never said
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
In school days we had been sweethearts
She was her father’s pride
Her folks lived in a mansion
Our cottage by its side
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Though years have brought their changes
The same old love still holds
She wed to please her parents
A man of wealth and gold
{end_of_verse}
