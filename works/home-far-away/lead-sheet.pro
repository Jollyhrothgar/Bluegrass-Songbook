{start_of_chorus}
Oh [G]lord have mercy on [C]this weary soul [G]of mine
May I walk in your light [D7]everyday
And [G]when I’ve crossed [C]that deep silent river
I’ll be [G]happy in [D7]that home [G]far away
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I wandered away from the [C]straight and [G]the narrow
Driftin’ like a ship lost at [D7]sea
No [G]lighthouse to guide [C]my weary [G]footsteps
Til Jesus [D7]answered [G]my plea
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The lights are bright no [C]longer [G]I’m blinded
From the bondage of sin I’m [D7]free
He [G]lifted me up [C]to join [G]salvation
I’ll live on [D7]eternally[G]
{end_of_verse}
