{start_of_chorus}
We will march through the streets of the [Bb]city
With our [F]loved ones gone [C]before
We will [F]sit on the banks of [Bb]the river
Where we’ll [C]meet to part [F]no more
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Jesus caused me when a [Bb]stranger
Wandering [F]from the fold [C]of God
He to [F]rescue me [Bb]from danger
And [C]transported by [F]His blood
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
From that fount of [Bb]everlasting
To thy [F]heart to sing [C]God’s praise
Dreams of [F]mercy [Bb]never ceasing
All [C]through songs of [F]loudest praise
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Hark the voice of Jesus [Bb]calling
Who will [F]go and work [C]today
Fields are [F]white and harvest [Bb]is waiting
Who will [C]bear the sheaves [Bb]away
{end_of_verse}
