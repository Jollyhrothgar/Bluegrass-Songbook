{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[Am]I'd been ridin' [G]fence all day [E7]way up on the [Am]summer range
Found a place to [G]make my bed [E7]as the evening [Am]shadows spread
[F]Beyond the [G]campfire [Am]light through the [F]stillness [G]of the [Am]night
Came the [F]call of a [G]coyote [Am]choi[G]r and the [F]song of the [G]wind in the [Am]wire[G]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[Am]As it strummed the [G]rusted strings [E7]it sang of [Am]long forgotten things
Many moons and [G]many suns [E7]of the real [Am]Americans
When the [F]arrow [G]and the [Am]bow stopped the [F]range of [G]buffa[Am]lo
And the [F]call of the [G]coyote [Am]choi[G]r and the [F]song of the [G]wind in the [Am]wire [G]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[Am]As the ghostly [G]balladeer [E7]hypnotized me [Am]I could hear
Bugle calls and [G]battle cries [E7]broken promi[Am]ses and lies
The [F]spirits [G]of the [Am]plain still [F]sing their [G]sad re[Am]frain
And the [F]call of the [G]coyote [Am]choi[G]r and the [F]song of the [G]wind in the [Am]wire[G]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[F]Spirits [G]of the [Am]plain still [F]sing their [G]sad re[Am]frain
And the [F]call of the [G]coyote [Am]choi[G]r and the [F]song of the [G]wind in the [Am]wire
{end_of_verse}
