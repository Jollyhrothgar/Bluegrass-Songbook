{start_of_chorus}
I’ve been [G]gathering flowers from the hillside
To wreath around your [D7]brow
But you’ve [G]kept me a-waitin’ so long, dear
The flowers have [D7]all [G]withered now
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I [C]know that you have seen trouble
But never hang down your [G7]head
Your [C]love for me is like the flowers
Your love for [G7]me [C]is dead
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
It was [G]on one bright June morning
The roses were in [D7]bloom
I [G]shot and killed my darling
And what will [D7]be [G]my [G7]doom?
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Closed [F]eyes cannot see these roses
Closed hands cannot hold them, [C7]you know
And these lips that still cannot kiss me
Has gone from [C7]me [F]forever more
{end_of_verse}
