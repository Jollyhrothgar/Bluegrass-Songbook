{start_of_verse}
They stood on the beach one evening
Out in the moonlight fair
Twas a boy in the pride of manhood
And a girl in beauty rare
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I never had thought that you loved me
An innocent look of surprise
Crept out from beneath her lashes
And into those deep brown eyes
Oh sir I was only flirting
Only a playing a part
Just another boy’s life ruined
Just another broken heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Sir I’m to be married this winter
Farewell and she gave me her hand
And drawing a robe around her
She left me alone on the sand
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
He goes with a crowd of passers
Always bitter and cold
Just another boy grown weary
Just another boy grown old
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
There’s a rose grows in your garden
White rose is the symbol of peace
And when I am dead little darling
Plant that rose at my head and my feet
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Oh sir I was only flirting
Only a playing a part
Just another boy’s life ruined
Just another broken heart
{end_of_chorus}
