{start_of_chorus}
Sugar coated love, you gave me on a plate
I took a bite and then I looked to see what I had ate
I found I had a cinder all covered up in white
That old sugar coated love is something I can’t bite
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
You say you are leaving me for another man
He has all the wealth and charm and not my kind of brand
Baby I fell down on my knees a pleading for your love
Can’t understand what I saw in a sugar coated love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
You called me your sugar plum, your baby and your pet
Said I was your Romeo and you my Juliet
I thought you were my angel, my little sugar dove
You sure had me fooled, babe, with that sugar coated love
{end_of_verse}
