[G]Well I used to hang out down at the VFW [D7]hall

His brother said that stone don't prove a thing to [G]me

It's veteran's [C]day and the skies are [G]gray
Leave the uniforms home cause there ain't gonna be a pa[D7]rade

And leave a [G]light in the window to[D7]night for Jimmy [G]McGrew

There's a hot rain falling on the back streets of Sai[D7]gon

He's just hanging by a thread and he looks like Jimmy [G]McGrew
