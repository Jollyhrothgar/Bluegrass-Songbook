To keep your love at [D7]home

Only hear the words you [G]want to say
They don’t make you get [C]inside that place
You kept locked up for so [D7]long
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]What if someone [D7]thanks you everyday

And the real world rushes [D7]in
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}

Then you’re gonna cry [G]on my shoulder
And think of things you [C]might have told her
[D7]And sweet things that might have [G]been
