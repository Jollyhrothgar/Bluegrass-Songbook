{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I sit here by the jukebox in this country bar
I gotta hear some fiddle and some [G7]steel guitar
A month ago my loving lady threw me out
And I don't know what to do so I just do [C]without
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
This old city brings me down it ain't been good to me
But it's all that I can [C7]do to keep my [F]sanity
But the [G7]future's looking bright cause I'm finally feeling right
And if it weren't for country music I'd go [C]crazy
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I got [F]holes in my boots I got [C]holes in my jeans
[G7]Holes in my pockets man you [C]know what that means
Between the [F]bar tab and the jukebox my [C]money's all been spent
And I’d [D7]vote for Merle Haggard for [G7]president
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Play some [C]Hank play some Willie play some Restless Heart
But don't play A Tender [C7]Lie cause I might [F]fall apart
But the [G7]future's looking bright cause I'm finally feeling right
And if it weren't for country music I'd go [C]crazy
{end_of_verse}
