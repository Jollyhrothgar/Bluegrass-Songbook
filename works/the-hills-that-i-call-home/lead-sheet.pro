{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I was [A]born [E]upon [A]a hillside
Where the [D]pines sing in the [A]wind
Where my [A]daddy [F#m]lived before me
And my [E]grandpa [A]before him
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
We [A]believe [E]in [A]simple livin’
It’s the [D]only life we [A]know
All we [A]need here is [F#m]our freedom
And a [E]place to call our [A]own
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
In the [D]land of Ethan [A]Allen
Where the [E]sugar maples [A]grow
Where the [A]wild grass fills the [F#m]meadows
And the [E]rocky [F#m]rivers flow
Lie the [E]hills that I [A]call home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Now I have [A]traveled [E]cross [A]the country
And there is [D]much that I have [A]learned
Still I [A]felt no peace [F#m]inside me
Till the [E]day that I [A]returned
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
For there’re [A]two [E]things you [A]can count on
In this [D]troubled world we [A]face
Every [A]season has an [F#m]ending
Every [E]person has a [A]place
{end_of_verse}
