[G]When I was young and [C]foolish and [G]always on the [D7]go
I [C]met up with this [G]beauty out [A7]on the western [D7]coast
I [G]learned that she was [C]married and [G]that her name was [D7]Dawn
But to [C]know that she was [G]married [D7]didn't send me [G]home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
We'd [C]meet in secret places [G]all along the bay
I [C]realize it wasn't right for [A7]man to live that [D7]way
We [G]lived high on his [C]money as [G]though it was our [D7]own
And [C]cared not how it [G]broke his heart to [D7]wait for Dawn till [G]dawn
{end_of_verse}

When he ran out of [C]money his [G]wife ran out of [D7]time
So [C]that's when she [G]divorced him at [A7]last she was all [D7]mine
[G]But I worked longer [C]hours so [G]far into the [D7]night
To [C]buy Dawn's pretty [G]dresses so [D7]short and oh so [G]tight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
For [C]weeks now I've been searching for [G]work with better pay
That [C]last two thousand that she spent I [A7]don't see how I'll [D7]pay
It [G]must be time for [C]reapin' the [G]wild seeds that I've [D7]sown
At [C]three A.M. I'm [G]weeping as I [D7]wait for Dawn till [G]dawn
Yes at [C]three A.M. I'm [G]weepin' as I [D7]wait for Dawn till [G]dawn
{end_of_verse}
