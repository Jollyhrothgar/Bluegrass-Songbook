{start_of_chorus}
Make [D]me an [C]angel that [G]flies from [D]Montgomery
Make [D]me a [C]poster of [G]an old [D]rodeo
Just [D]give me [C]one thing one [G]thing I can [D]hold on to
To [D]believe in [C]this livin’ just [A]a hard way [D]to go
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I [D]am an [G]old man [D]named after [G]my father
Now [D]lady is [G]another [A]child who’s [D]grown old
If [D]dreams were [G]thunder [D]and lightening [G]was desire
This [D]old house would have [G]burned down [A]a long [D]time ago
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
When [D]I was [G]a young man now [D]I was [G]a cowboy
I [D]weren’t much to [G]look at but [A]a free [D]ramblin’ man
But [D]that was a long [G]time and [D]no matter how [G]much I try
Those [D]years [G]just flow by like [A]a broken [D]down dam.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
There’s [D]flies in [G]the kitchen [D]Lord I can [G]hear’em buzzin’
Ain’t [D]done [G]nothin’ since I [A]woke [D]up today
How [D]the hell can a [G]person [D]go to work in [G]the mornin’
Come [D]home in the [G]evenin’ and have [A]nothin’ [D]to say?
{end_of_verse}
