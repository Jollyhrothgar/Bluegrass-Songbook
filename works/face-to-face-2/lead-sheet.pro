{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Face to [C]face toe to [G]toe where we'll [D7]stop heaven [G]knows
Arm in [C]arm cheek to [G]cheek who's to [D7]blame
Hand in [G]hand heart to heart we never [C]should have let it [G]start
But it's too late we shared it all now we'll [D7]have to share the [G]blame
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I can feel your body tremble as I [C]hold you in my [G]arms
For you know another woman has my [D7]name
Now she [G]knows it's just you and me but she don't [C]want to set me [G]free
We've shared it all now it's [D7]time to share the [G]blame
