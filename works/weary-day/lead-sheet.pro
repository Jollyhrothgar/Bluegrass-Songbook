{start_of_verse}
Weary day pass away
Look what you have done to me
Just this morning without warning
My love turned her back on me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
She was cryin when she left me
Told me she was leavin town
It’s an awful awful feeling
When your lover turns you down
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Like a lonesome dove a grieving
For a love that can’t found
It’s an awful, awful feeling
When your lover turns you down
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
I have never been so lonely
Since I saw her catch that train
Something awful seems to whisper
She will not be back again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
When I see that sun a sinking
Sinking down into the west
I’ll be thinking of my little darlin
She’s the one that I love best
{end_of_verse}
