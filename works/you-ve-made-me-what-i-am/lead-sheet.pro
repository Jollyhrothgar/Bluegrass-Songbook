{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]You say that I'm no angel oh I [D7]know it much too [G]well
How can you look [D7]into my eyes and [C]ask me why I [G]failed
You know that I still [D7]love you and I [C]let you drag me [G]down
How can you talk about me when you've [D7]made me what I [G]am

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You made me what I [D7]am but look who [C]everybody [G]blames
When you [A7]know you're the reason I hang my head in sha[D7]me
Oh you [G]tell me to [D7]forget you and to [C]stop my hangin' [G]round
I'd be ashamed if I were you you've [D7]made me what I [G]am
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
You never really loved me but I [D7]found that out too [G]late
I've tried to find a [D7]way to change my [C]love for you to [G]hate
You act like you don't [D7]know me when there's [C]someone else [G]around
How can you hold your head up when you've [D7]made me what I [G]am

I'd be ashamed if I were you you've [D7]made me what I [G]am
