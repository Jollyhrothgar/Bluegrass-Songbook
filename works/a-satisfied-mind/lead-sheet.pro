{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
How [A]many [D]times [E]have [E7]you heard [A]someone say
If I had [E]his [E7]money [D]I’d do [A]things my way
How little [E]they [E7]know that [D]it’s so [A]hard to find
One rich man in [E]a [E7]hundred [D]with a [A]satisfied mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Once [A]I [D]was [E]living [E7]in [A]fortune and fame
Had everything [E]that I [E7]dreamed of to [D]get a start in [A]life’s game
Then suddenly [E]it [E7]happened [D]I lost [A]every dime
But I’m richer [E]by [E7]far [D]with a [A]satisfied mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Money can’t [D]buy [E]back [E7]your youth when [A]you’re old
Or a friend when [E]you’re [E7]lonely [D]or a heart that’s [A]grown cold
And the world’s [E]richest [E7]man [D]is a [A]pauper at times
Compared to a [E]man [E7]with [D]a [A]satisfied mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
When my life [E]is [E7]over and [D]my time has [A]run out
My friends and [E]my [E7]loved ones [D]I’ll leave [A]there’s no doubt
But one thing’s [D]for [E]certain when [E7]it [A]comes my time
I’ll leave [E]this old [E7]world [D]with a [A]satisfied mind
{end_of_verse}
