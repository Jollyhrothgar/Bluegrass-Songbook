{start_of_verse}
Do you ever feel lonesome when you’re down in San Antone
Beg steal or borrow two nickels or a dime to call you on the phone
I’ll meet you at Alamo mission we can say our prayers
The Holy Ghost and the Virgin Mother will hear us as we kneel there
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
In the Midnight
In the Moonlight
In the Midnight Moonlight Moonlight
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
Did you ever feel sorrow for the deeds that you have done
With no hope for tomorrow in the setting of the sun
And the ocean is howling with things that might have been
And that last good-morning sunrise would be the brightest you’ve ever seen
{end_of_verse}
