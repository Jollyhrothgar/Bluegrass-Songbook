An old Jane about 49 came in to view the town
She [E]registered up at Smith’s [A]Hotel as Miss Ada Brown
She said she was just 25 and that she was in love
With a young lad about 16, she called him her turtledove

He [E]never came [A]back, no, [B7]he never [E]came back

He [E]taken my order and bowed his head [B7]and slowly [E]walked away
