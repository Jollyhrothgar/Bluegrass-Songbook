{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
The [G]fairest bloom the mountain know
Is not an [G]iris or a wild rose
But the little [C]flower of which [G]i’ll tell
Known as the [D]brave [G]acony [D]bell[G]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Just a simple [G]flower so small and plain
With a pearly [G]hue and a little known name
But the yellow birds [C]sing when they see [G]it bloom
For they know that [D]spring is [G]coming soon
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well it makes its [G]home mid the rocks and the rills
Where the snow lies [G]deep on the windy hills
And it tells the [C]world “why should [G]i wait
This ice and [D]snow is gonna melt [G]away”
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
And so i’ll [C]sing that yellow [G]bird’s song
For the troubled [D]times will soon [G]be gone
{end_of_verse}
