{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Well the kids came out to play last Sunday morning
And I came in from playing all night [G7]long
I walked in and slammed the [C]door 
And put my cigarette out on the [F]floor
And I [C]told her a dirty [G7]joke and the fight was [C]on
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Well you better quit bringing those barroom habits home to mama
Yeah you better quit calling me Rosie when you know that's not my [G7]name
When you come home it's like a bad [C]dream
I follow you round trying to keep the place [F]clean
You better quit [C]bringing those barroom [G7]habits home to [C]mama
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Last night I got high and I got lonesome
And I remember just what I needed was waiting at [G7]home
I popped a top all over the [C]wall 
And after that she wasn't friendly at [F]all
And I could [C]tell by the look in her eye that I done [G7]something [C]wrong

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Well you better quit bringing those barroom habits home to mama

I follow you round trying to keep the place [F]clean
You better quit [C]bringing those barroom [G7]habits home to [C]mama
