{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]It seems like years and a million tears 
Since you've left the old [G7]hometown
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Now you've changed they say and the great white way
Is your new stomping [C]ground
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well it's plain to see you've forgotten me
Cause you never [C7]write or [F]call
But I'll be around when they let [G7]you down 
And I'll catch you when you [C]fall
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I'll catch you when you fall
There's no one else [G7]but you

Now you're flying high but honey by and by
You're gonna cry for love that's [C]true

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
So when you're uptown baby
Starts giving you [C7]the [F]stall
I'll be around when they let [G7]you down 
And I'll catch you when you [C]fall
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Well I've heard it said they've turned your head
You're ashamed of us [G7]back home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
But I'll bet the sound of a southern bound
Still chills you to the [C]bone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 9}
With your haughty pose and your uptown clothes
You're not fooling [C7]me at [F]all
When you're feeling bad your old country [G7]lad 
Is gonna catch you when you [C]fall
{end_of_verse}
