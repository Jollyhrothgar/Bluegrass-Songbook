{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G7]I don't much like summer nights
[C]Palm trees blowing in the breeze
And I've [D7]got no use for a full moon
Shinning [G7]down on the [D7]sea
It [G7]brings to mind another time
And a [C]girl I used to know
That [D7]loved me and held me [G7]then let me [C]go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G7]I don't go near the water now
Cause I'm afraid I'll [C]surly drown
And I [A7]have a sea of heartaches
That took a hold [D7]and pulled me down
The [G7]ocean waves brings back yesterdays
And the [C]girl I used to know
That [D7]loved me and held me [G7]then let me [C]go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G7]I don't go near the water now
Cause I'm afraid I'll [C]surly drown
And I [A7]have a sea of heartaches
That took a hold [D7]and pulled me down
Wish [G7]I'd forget some mistakes
The [C]way she turned the lamp down low
And [D7]loved me and held me [G7]then let me [C]go
{end_of_verse}
