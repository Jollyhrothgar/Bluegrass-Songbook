[C]I must have done something bad [C7]sometime in my [F]life
And I paid for it [C]time and [G7]again
[C]But this time you've hurt me so bad I [C7]could lay down and [F]die
And the pain grows each [C]day  [G7]ten times ten times [C]ten

If I thought my hand was against you why [C7]I'd cut off my [F]arm
And I'd walk off and [C]leave it [G7]behind
[C]If I thought that you needed money why I'd [C7]sell my own [F]soul
And I'd even [C]steal from the poor [G7]and the [C]blind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I can't understand how ice can [C7]glitter like [F]fire
Why you had me [C]fooled all [G7]alone

And now I've got [C]nothing at [G7]all and you're [C]gone
