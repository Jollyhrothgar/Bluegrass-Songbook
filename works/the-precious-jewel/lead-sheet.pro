{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Way [G]back in the hills when [C]a boy I [G]once wandered
Buried deep in the grave lies the [A]one that [D]I love
She [G]was called from this earth [C]a jewel [G]for heaven
More pricious than diamonds [D]more precious [G]than gold
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
A [G]jewel here on earth [C]a jewel [G]in heaven
She’ll brighten the kingdom [A]around God’s [D]Great Throne
May the angels [G]have peace [C]God bless her [G]in heaven
They’ve broken my heart and [D]they’ve left me [G]to roam
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
When [G]a girl of sixteen [C]we courted [G]each other
She promised someday to [A]become my [D]sweet wife
I [G]bought her the ring [C]to wear on her [G]finger
But the angels they called her to [D]heraven [G]one night
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
This [G]world has its wealth [C]it’s trials [G]and troubles
Mother earth holds her treasures of [A]diamonds [D]and gold
But it can’t hold the [G]soul [C]of one [G]precious jewel
She is resting in peace with [D]the [G]heavenly fold
{end_of_verse}
