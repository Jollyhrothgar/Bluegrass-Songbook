[C]My baby I know [F]that you want [C]me

Your [G7]deep blue eyes how they haunt [C]me 
[D7]Though you're far [G7]away

Oh why [C]did she take you [F]away from my [C]arms

My baby I want [F]you tonight [C]dear

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I dream of your baby [C][F]caresses 
[F]Dimples and golden [C]hair
And [G7]reach out to clasp you in my [C]arms 
To [D7]find only emptiness [G7]there
{end_of_verse}

Your [C]future has been the [F]chief thing in my [C]life

My [G7]plans and my schemes are all blasted it [C]seems 
[D7]For you are my only [C][G7]embrace
{end_of_verse}
