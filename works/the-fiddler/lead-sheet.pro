{start_of_verse}
When the fiddler has played his last tune for the night
And the singer has sung his last song
And the mandolins and guitars and banjo’s are quiet
And the loud noisy crowd has gone home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Theres nothing as quiet as a night with no music
Or as dark as night with no stars
And nothing as lonesome as a cold lonely river
Just wondering all night where you are
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
As we walked together the music was playing
The wind whispered soft through the trees
With your arms around me whispered I love you
And the words seemed to float on the breeze
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Now the fiddler has played his last tune for the night
And the singer has sung his last song
All the mandolins and guitars and banjo’s are quiet
Like the music sweetheart you are gone
{end_of_verse}
