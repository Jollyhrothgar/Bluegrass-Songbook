{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Everybody I know is a [F]looking for [C]love
But they [F]don't know how they [C]give it
Everybody is a looking for [F]more out of [C]life
But they don't know [G7]how they live [C]it
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]Like everything else if we don't return it
The [F]love's gonna run out [C]fast
We gotta put more in than we take out
[G7]If we want love to [C]last
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
If it don't rain we [F]might go to [C]church
To [F]put in a dollar [C]bill
Shake the preacher's hand and [F]ask him for [C]dinner
But really hope [G7]he never [C]will
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Then we wonder why we don't get ahead
As [F]life keeps passing us [C]by
We keep a looking for things that we can't find
[G7]And keep on wondering [C]why

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Well we say we can't afford just to [F]take a little [C]time
To help a [F]poor soul in [C]need
We do just enough to [F]ease our [C]conscience
In the world of [G7]hate and [C]greed
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
What we need is more love but because of the color of the

We gotta put more in than we take out
[G7]If we want love to [C]last
