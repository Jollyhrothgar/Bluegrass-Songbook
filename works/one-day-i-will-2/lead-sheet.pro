{start_of_verse}
I never have seen the face of my Savior
But serving Him has been such a thrill
I never have seen the gates to the city
But one day one day I will
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
One day I’m gonna walk on the streets of pure gold
And they tell me that half has never yet been told
I’ll be united with my loved ones on Zion’s holy hill
But one day one day I will
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Since the day I first met Him He has been all to me
And my life with joy He has filled
And I’m longing for the day when my eyes will behold Him
But one day one day I will
{end_of_verse}
