{start_of_verse}
There’s a girl on my mind I can’t get over
Who’d break the heart of any man
Without her things just falls to pieces
Oh I’m singing about my Mary Ann
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
So I’ll just keep touching up my gray hair
Live and hope someday she’ll understand
It’s no matter if I live to be a hundred
There’ll always be a place in my heart for Mary Ann
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I know she’s out there somewhere in a world that can’t be found
Just to think of her still tears me down
If teardrops were pennies I’d be a wealthy man
From the tears I’ve cried for Mary Ann
{end_of_verse}
