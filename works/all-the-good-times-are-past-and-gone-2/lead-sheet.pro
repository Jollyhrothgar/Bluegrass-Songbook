{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I wish to the lord [C]I’d never [G]been born
Or died when I was [D7]young
I never would have seen your sparkling blue eyes
Or heard [D7]your [G]lying tongue
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
All the good times [C]are past [G]and gone
All the good times are [D7]o’er
All the good times [C]are past [G]and gone
Little darling [D7]don’t weep [G]no more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Don’t you see that turtle dove
That flies from pine [D7]to pine
He’s [G]mourning for [C]his own [G]true love
Just like I [D7]mourn [G]for mine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Come back come back my own true love
And stay awhile with me
For if ever I’ve had a friend in this world
You’ve been that friend to me
{end_of_verse}
