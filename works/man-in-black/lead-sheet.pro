{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Well you wonder why I always dress in black
Why you never see bright colors on [D7]my back
And [F]why does my [C]appearance
Seem to [F]have a somber [C]tone
Well there's [D7]a reason for the things that I [G7]have on
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]I wear the black for the poor and the beaten down
Living in the hopeless hungry side [D7]of town
I [F]wear it for the [C]prisoner
Who has [F]long paid for his [C]crime
But is [D7]there because he's a victim of [G7]the times
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I wear the black for those who've never read
Or listened to the words that Jesus said
About the road to happiness through love and charity
Why you'd think He's talking straight to you and me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Well we're doing mighty fine I do suppose
In our streak of lightning cars and fancy clothes
But just so we're reminded of the ones who are held back
Up front there ought-a be a man in black
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I wear it for the sick and lonely old
For the reckless ones whose bad trip left them cold
I wear the black in mourning for the lives that could have been
Each week we lose a hundred fine young men
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
And I wear it for the thousands who have died
Believing that the Lord was on their side
I wear it for another hundred thousand who have died
Believing that we all were on their side
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Well there's things that never will be right I know
And things need changing everywhere you go
But till we start to make a move to make a few things right
You'll never see me wear a suit of white
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
[C]Aw I'd love to wear a rainbow every day
And tell the world that every thing's [D7]OK
But I'll [F]try to carry [C]off a little [F]darkness on [C]my back
Till things are brighter [G7]I'm the man [C]in black
{end_of_verse}
