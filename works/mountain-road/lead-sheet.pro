{start_of_verse}
There’s a little road back in the mountains
That I traveled on when just a kid
Many years ago I was bound to travel
Now I’m sorry for the things I did
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I remember how my Mom was weeping
As she held me close whispered son don’t go
And Daddy’s out stretched hand was trembling
His heart was breaking now I know
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
After many years I came to see them
My joy to grief turned like a stone
Two graves with words please hurry home son
We’re waiting for you by your mountain road
{end_of_verse}
