{start_of_verse}
Long John walkin’ around in the rain
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
He’s long gone Lost John
Long gone Lost John
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
No hat on his head no shoes on his feet
He’s a beggin the women for his meat
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I had an ol’ dog and his name was
like a rabbit through Bowlin’ Green
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Lost John walked around in rain
Around the corner left him sittin’ by the ol’ railroad
{end_of_verse}
