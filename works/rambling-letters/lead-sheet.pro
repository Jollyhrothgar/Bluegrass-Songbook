{start_of_chorus}
I don’t [C]want [G7]your [C]rambling letters
Don’t want your [F]picture in [C]a frame
All I [F]want is you [C]in person
Won’t you [G7]let me change [C]your name
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Mama said you’d [G7]come [C]home soon
Papa [F]warned me not [C]to wait
Sister [F]thinks that you still [C]love me
Hurry [G7]home [C]right away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I’m so tired of [G7]long [C]distance kisses
Love by [F]mail is all [C]so cold
I just [F]want you in my [C]arms dear
Then our [G7]love just can’t [C]grow old
{end_of_verse}
