{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Put no [D]stone at my head, no [G]flowers on my tomb
No [D]gold plated sign In a [A]marble pillared room
The [D]one thing that I want when they [G]lay me in the ground
When I [D]die tear [A]my still house [D]down
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Oh [G]tear my still house down [G]let it go to rust
Don’t [D]leave no [D]trace of the [D]hiding [D]place
Where I made that evil stuff
For [G]all my time and money no [G]profit did I see
That [D]old copper [D]kettle was the [A]death [D]of [D]me
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
When [D]I was a child way [G]back in the hills
I [D]laughed at the men who [A]tended those stills
But that [D]old mountain shine it [G]caught me somehow
When I [D]die tear [A]my still house [D]down
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Oh [D]tell all your children that [G]hell ain’t no dream
‘Cause [D]Satan he lives In my [A]whiskey machine
And [D]in my time of dying I [G]know where I’m bound
When I [D]die tear [A]my still house [D]down
{end_of_verse}
