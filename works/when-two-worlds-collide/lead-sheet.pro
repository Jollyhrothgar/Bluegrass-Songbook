{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Your world was so different from [Em]mine don't you [A7]see
We [D7]couldn't be close though [G]we tried
We both reached for heaven but [Em]ours weren't the [A7]same
That's what [D7]happens when two [G]worlds [G7]collide
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]Your world was made up of [G]things sweet and [G7]good
[C]My world could never fit in [G]wish it [D7]could
Two [G]hearts lie in [G7]shambles and oh [A7]how they've cried
That's what [D7]happens when two worlds [G7][G]collide
{end_of_verse}

That's what [D7]happens when two worlds [G]collide
