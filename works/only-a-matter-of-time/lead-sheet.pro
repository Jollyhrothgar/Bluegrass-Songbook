{start_of_verse}
There’s no use in denying the tears you’ve been crying
Tell me have you made up your mind?
It seems all I can do is bring trouble to you
It was only a matter of time.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Now that you’re leaving me darling
How slowly the hours pass me by
Thought I could love you forever
But it was only a matter of time.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
Had I known from the start I’d only break your heart
Well darling I would have set you free
But a love that is wrong can only last so long
Before it fades to memory.
{end_of_verse}
