{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Many miles have come between us 
Since the morning sun has seen us
[F]Building up our dream world to the [D7]sky [G7]
[F]Now my days are cold and dark 
The [G7]thoughts of you still warm my heart
As [C]I recall the love you gave to [F]me 
[Dm]Soft and warm with[G7]in my memo[C]ry
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Hidden deep within your eyes 
With daffodils and summer skies
With [F]meadow larks and butterflies that [D7]play[G7]
[F]Sometimes when the night is still 
I [G7]kiss the breeze and almost feel
Your [C]sweet lips pressed against me tender[F]ly 
[Dm]Soft and warm with[G7]in my memo[C]ry
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Where do all the flowers go 
When summer's covered up with snow
[F]I guess the winter winds call out her [D7]name[G7]
[F]You were like the summer flower 
[G7]Love is just a fleeting hour
[C]All I ever dream has to comfort [F]me 
[Dm]Soft and warm with[G7]in my memo[C]ry
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Now the winter laughs at me 
And asks me where I'm gonna be
[F]If you don't bring the springtime back [D7]again [G7]
[F]I'll be running through the snow 
Search[G7]ing for the winter rose
To [C]press between the dreams you have with [F]me
[Dm]Soft and warm with[G7]in my memo[C]ry 
{end_of_verse}
