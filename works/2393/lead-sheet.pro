{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
He saw my sin and knew they would [C]keep me
Out of his [D]heaven but he believed I was [G]worth saving
So he came down to earth as a [C]man
Took the sin that [D]condemned me
Paid the price for me so that I could come [G]in
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The key to [C]heaven [D]was hung on [G]a nail
On the cross where he [D]suffered
His love [G]prevailed He opened [C]the flood gates
Parted the veil
The key to [C]heaven [D]was hung on [G]a nail
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Bethlehem’s manger was a quiet [C]beginning
You knew he was [D]coming but he died on a hill
With so many [G]watching and even history
Says that he [C]lived but it doesn’t [D]explain
Why he endured the shame and died like he [G]did
{end_of_verse}
