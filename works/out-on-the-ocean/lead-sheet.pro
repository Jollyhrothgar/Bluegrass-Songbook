{start_of_verse}
I am sailing out on the ocean
Many miles from home on sea
And I wonder little darlin
If you ever think of me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I am just on old true lover
Roaming through this world alone
And I have no one to love me
Through this life I’ll always own
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I was once carefree and happy
When I won my sweetheart’s hand
And now my life is empty
Since she’s wed another man
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Do you remember little darlin
Just how much I cared for you
And you told me that you loved me
But you proved to be untrue
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I am travelling far away dear
Many miles from this old place
And I know I’ll never forget you
Your sweet smiles and happy face
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I can hear my mother calling
I can see my father pray
If I’d listened to my father
I would be at home today
{end_of_verse}
