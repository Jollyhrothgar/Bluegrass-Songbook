[G]Now some folks like the summertime when [C]they can walk about

[G]I traced her little footprints in the [D]snow

[D]For I found her when the snow was on the [G]ground
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G]I dropped in to see her there was a [C]big round moon
[D]Her mother said she just stepped out but would be returning [G]soon
[G]I found her little footprints and I [C]traced them in the snow
[D]I found her when the snow was on the [G]ground

[G]Now she's up in heaven she's with the [C]angel band
[D]I know I'm going to meet her in that promised [G]land

[D]For I found her when the snow was on the [G]ground
