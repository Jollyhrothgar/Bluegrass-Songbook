{start_of_verse}
You spurned the love I gave you darling
A love you once was proud to own
Your found someone who you love better
And in my dreams I walk alone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
I’ll just pretend that I don’t love you
I’ll just pretend that I don’t care
And when I meet you face to face dear
I’ll turn my head I’ll just pretend
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
Those happy hours we spent together
Forever in my heart will live
That’s all I have for each tomorrow
For we will never meet again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I’ll try my best to forget you
To love you now is such a sin
And as I’m facing all my fears, dear
They’ll understand I won’t pretend
{end_of_verse}
