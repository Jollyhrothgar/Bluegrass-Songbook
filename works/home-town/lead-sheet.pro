{start_of_verse}
When I was young I couldn’t see
How much the old town had meant to me
But it’s too late to mourn and cry
As long as I live this old town will never die
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
It ain’t fair in our home town
When people tear our buildings down
This old town won’t be the same
Seems as tho it’s an awful shame
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
The family church house is torn down too
And we’ve all been wondering what will we do
To find another would be kind of hard
But we will all cherish pleasant memories serving God
{end_of_verse}
