{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]You said I'd for[F]get that [G7]we'd ever [C]met
But that's one thing that [G7]I can't seem to [C]do
Cause these [C7]tears in my eyes they [F]make me rea[Dm]lize
I [G7]can't shake this memory of [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh you spoke many words but a [F]lot I never heard
And the [D7]sound has my heart broke in [G]two[G7]
As you [C]walked up [C7]with him my [F]whole world went [Dm]dim
Oh I [G7]can't shake this memory of [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Yes there's one thing [C7]you gave that [F]I'll take to my [Dm]grave
I [G7]can't shake this memory of [C]you
{end_of_verse}
