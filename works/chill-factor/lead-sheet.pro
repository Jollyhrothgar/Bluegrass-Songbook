[G]Seems like every [Am]November  [D7]when the weather gets [G]bad
I start to [Am]remember  [D7]all the good love we [G]had
The long nights get [C]longer I wish a friend would come [G]by
The forecast is [Am]zero  [D7]and the chill factors [G]high
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You know the chill factors [C]higher on a clear windy [G]day
But there’s no wind this [Am]morning  and [C]no wind on the [G]way
But there’s a snowstorm inside me                              G     Where there's [C]no high record wind
And I'm colder this [Am]morning  [D7]than I've ever [G]been
