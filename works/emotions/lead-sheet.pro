{start_of_verse}
Emotions are making me care more for you
I’ve found a heart I know will always be so true
But still dearest darling I feel kinda blue
Keep wondering if someday somehow I might lose you.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Emotions are making me long for your kiss
For safe in your arms I know heavenly bliss
Emotions in my heart are calling for you
If you confess I bet you have emotions too.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Emotions can bring you much sorrow and pain
Emotions can be the sunshine after rain
Emotions are charged with the power of fate
These same emotions make you love or make you hate.
{end_of_verse}
