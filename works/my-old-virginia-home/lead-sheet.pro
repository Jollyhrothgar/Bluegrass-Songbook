{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
It was on one winter day from my [G]home I went [D]away
Far away from friends and home I longed to [A]roam
But [D]tonight I’m lone and sad just [G]a little [D]homesick lad
And I’m longing for my [A]old [D]Virginia home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
I’m a lad from [G]old [D]Virginia [G]bravely knocking my way [D]back home
To that cabin [G]home in [D]the mountains [A]never more let me roam
I’m a [D]lad [G]from old [D]Virginia and [G]I’m coming [D]coming home
There I’ll settle [G]down [D]forever in [A]my old [D]Virginia home
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Since I left that little shack how my [G]mind has [D]wandered back
How mother often prayed for her [A]lad
But from [D]her I went astray and [G]I know I’ve [D]dearly paid
So I’m coming back to [A]mother and [D]my dad
{end_of_verse}
