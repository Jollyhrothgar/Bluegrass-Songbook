[C]I haven't been well in the [G7]last two days

Packed her things and just [F]said so long

And [G7]that's when the tears broke out on [C]me
{end_of_verse}

I never was sick [G7]up till then 
But I've got a feeling this will [C]do me in
Every time I think about the [F]thing she said 
I [G7]get real sick and I have to [C]go to bed
