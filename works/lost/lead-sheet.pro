{start_of_verse}
Lost lost lost
Lost in this world without you
Lost lost lost
Lost in this world without you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Since you turned me down all I do is ramble round
And I don’t care what happens to me
My heart was young and gay till the day you went away
Now life here means nothing to me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
The words you said to me still haunts my memory
It seems they’re on my mind both day and night
The lies that you told torture my weary soul
Love is blind I guess I couldn’t see
{end_of_verse}
