Now come all ye hunters who follow the gun
Beware of your shooting at the setting of the sun
For Polly’s own true love he shot in the dark
But oh and alas Polly Vaughn was his mark.

He [Am]ran up [Am7]beside her [Am6]and saw [Dm]that it was she
Cried “Polly oh Polly have I killed thee”
He [Am]lifted up [Am7]her [Am6]head and saw [Dm]that she was dead
And [Am]a [Am7]fountain of tears [Am6]for [E7]his [Am]true love he shed.

And you won’t be convicted for what you have done.”
