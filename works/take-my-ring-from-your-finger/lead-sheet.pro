{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I’m [D]happy now at last you [G]are smiling
And [G]I’m [A]glad I have found you in [D]his arms
For [D]no longer I’ll keep you [G]unhappy
And [G]I’ll [A]vow to never do [D]you any harm
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Take [D]my ring from your finger
Set [D]me free as [A]a dove
You [D]don’t need me [G]no longer
You [A]have found the one [D]you love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
So [D]my heart will likely break when I [G]leave you
When my position at last I can see
When [D]I found you in his arms you [G]were crying
And [G]that’s [A]more than you ever did [D]for me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
You [D]can have our little home in [G]the mountains
With [G]the [A]honeysuckles  twining round [D]the door
When [D]he carries you over [G]the threshold
I [G]hope [A]that you’ll be [D]happy evermore
{end_of_verse}
