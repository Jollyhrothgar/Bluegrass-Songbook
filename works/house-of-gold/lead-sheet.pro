{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
People [D]steal they cheat and lie
For [D]wealth and what it will buy
But don’t [G]they know on [D]judgement day
That gold and [A]silver will melt [D]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I’d [D]rather be in a dark grave
And [D]to know that my poor soul was saved
Than to live in this [G]world in a house [D]of gold
And deny my [A]God and doom [D]my soul
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
What good is gold and silver too
If your hearts not pure and true
Sinner [G]hear me when [D]I say
Fall down on your knees and pray
{end_of_verse}
