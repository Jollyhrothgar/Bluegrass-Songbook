{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Don't build for me no [F]paper [G7][C]man-sions 
That only stand until you've [C]gone
You've paint the nicest futures of anyone I [D7]know
[G7]You always leave me holding on to pretty words that [C]glow
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You've built a thousand mansions
Out of dreams that seemed [D7]so strong
But they're [G7]always made of paper not of [C]stone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Don't build for me no [F]paper [G7][C]man-sion 
That I can never call my [C]own
For love can't live in [F]paper [G7][C]man-sions 
That only stand until you've [C]gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
You've always been a dreamer dear and I'm a dreamer [D7]too
But I guess [G7]I've had too many of the kind that don't come [C]true
So don't build me no mansion with paper walls so [D7]thin
[G7]That only stand until you leave [C]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Don't build for me no [F]paper [G7][C]man-sion 
That I can never call my [C]own
For love can't live in [F]paper [G7][C]man-sions 
That only stand until you've [C]gone
{end_of_verse}
