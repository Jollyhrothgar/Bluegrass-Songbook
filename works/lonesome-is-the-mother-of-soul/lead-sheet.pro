{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]They say I sing my [F]songs 
With [C]lots of blue eyed [F]soul
[C]What they mean is [F]Lord I sing it [C]sad
But feeling like I [F]feel 
I can't [C]sing no other [F]way
She [C]left me Lord and [F]oh I hurt so [C]bad
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And lonesome [F]is the mother of [C]soul
And lonesome [D7]gave birth to my [G7]blues
I'm the [C]orphan child of emptiness 
The [F]son of heartache [C]untold
And lonesome [F]is the mother of [C]soul
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I thought that hurts like [F]this 
Were [C]saved for those who are [F]dyin'
[C]Lord I must be [F]dyin' and not [C]know
The soulful sound you [F]hear from me 
Is [C]only my heart [F]cryin'
I'm [C]lonesome and I [F]miss my baby [C]so
