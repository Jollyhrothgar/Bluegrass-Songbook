[G]I see you in the mornin' with your [C]spirit to the [G]sky

And I see you in the darkness with the [C]moonlight on your [G]face

And I [C]feel the way our faces come to[G]gether into space
[D7]Where the heart has never been [G]before
{end_of_verse}

Holy [C]woman I will build a shinin' monument to [G]you  [C]wait and [G]see

I see you in the glory of your [C]passion blazin' [G]bright
And God almighty stillness of the [C]stars that fill the [G]night
Cause you [C]held me in the darkness and you [G]led me to the light
[D7]Turned the key and opened me a [G]door
