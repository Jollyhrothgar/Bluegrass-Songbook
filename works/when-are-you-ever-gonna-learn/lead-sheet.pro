{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Look in the mirror wipe the [C]guilt from your eyes
Take a [D7]drink to chase the bitter taste left [G]over from your [G7]lies
You go [C]right back to the bottom every time my back is [G]turned
Buddy [D7]when are you ever gonna [G]learn
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Go on friend bow your head you can't [C]look me in the eye
Because [D7]just like me you hate to see a [G]man break down and [G7]cry
But you'll [C]go on burning bridges till there's no more left to [G]burn
Buddy [D7]when are you ever gonna [G]learn
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Was the [D7]thrill worth the gamble that you [G]live from day to day
Does it [A7]really hold a candle to the [D7]love you threw away
Each [G]night takes you closer to the [C]point of no return
Buddy [D7]when are you ever gonna [G]learn
Buddy [D7]when are you ever gonna [G]learn
{end_of_verse}
