{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Here I [A]stand by this chilly water waitin’ for my final call
Standing by the river looking [E]beyond
Gazin’ toward the [A]land of fadeless beauty o’er the surges rise and fall
Standing by the river looking [E]beyond
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Standing by the [A]river waiting for the boatman
Listen to the music on the other [E]shore
I can hear the [A]angels singing out a welcome
With my friends and loved ones (with my friends [E]have gone [A]before)
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Music from the [A]land of endless glory fallin upon my listening ear
Standing by the river looking [E]beyond
Faces of [A]my friends I often vision forms of loved ones oft appear
Standing by the river looking [E]beyond
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Shadows of [A]night are swiftly falling lo I hear the boatman’s oar
Standing by the river looking [E]beyond
Many are the [A]voices sweetly calling I must tarry hear no more
Standing by the river looking [E]beyond
{end_of_verse}
