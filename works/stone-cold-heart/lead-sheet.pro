{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]It’s over this time it’s the end of the line
And when you awake I’ll be [G7]gone
It’s [C]plain now to see there’s no room for me
In a [G7]heart that’s made of [C]stone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
There may [F]come a day the world blows away
And [C]mountains will crumble [G7]apart
But I [C]know too well all the fires of hell
Cannot [G7]melt your stone cold [C]heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Lying close to you turns me blue
When you turn away from my [G7]arms  
Love is [C]dying to live and I’m willing to give
But [G7]your heart has turned to [C]stone
