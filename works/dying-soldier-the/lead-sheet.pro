{start_of_verse}
The sun was slowly sinking or the hilltops far away
The land was endless beauty where the dying soldier lay
Tears were streaming down his face as he slowly raised his head
And these were the dying words he said
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Oh carry me back to old Tennessee
Let this be my last repose
Lay my feet beneath while I lie
Lay my head beneath the rose
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
Take this message to my mother for I know she’s old and gray
At home I know she’s waiting for her boy’s return some day
Oh my mother I’ve come through for my country and for you
And I’m dying for the red white and blue
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
O’er the hills of Tennessee where the wild wind wonders free
There’s a little girl waiting there for me
Tell her that the rose she gave me will be placed upon my grave
In memory of her soldier brave
{end_of_verse}
