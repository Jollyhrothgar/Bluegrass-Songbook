[G]Monday morning [B7]takes a little [C]longer
To [G]clear away the [D7]cobwebs in my [G]head [D7]
It's [G]afternoon [B7]before my body [C]lets me
To change my [G]eyes back to [D7]blue from bloodshot [G]red
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Then it's back to a [C]bottle filled with [G]foam
For my evening pick me up on my way [D7]home
The [G]days pass by my [C]foggy mind my [G]hair is turning [C]gray
It gets [G]more and more [D7]like Monday every[G]day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Through lonely nights I [B7]struggle just [C]waiting
For [G]another day just [D7]like the one [G]before [D7]
My [G]shaky hands will [B7]tremble as I [C]stumble
Through [G]the day till I go [D7]running back for [G]more
