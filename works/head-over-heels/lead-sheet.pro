{start_of_verse}
I think I’ll go across the ocean
If I don’t change my notion
I’ve just got to forget you if I can
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
I’m feeling so blue
I don’t know what to do
Because I’m
head over heels in love with you
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
Every day is sad and lonely
For I’m thinking of you only
I just can’t sleep when I lay down
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Oh I’d like to be forgiven
But this life ain’t worth living
If have to sit and worry over you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Oh the nights are long and dreary
All I do is sit and worry
I just can’t bear the thought of losing you
{end_of_verse}
