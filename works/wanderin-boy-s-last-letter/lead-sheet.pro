{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I'm writing this [F]letter to [C]you tonight mom 
And [G7]this is the reason I [C]write
It's been a long [F]time since [C]I have been home 
Oh I [G7]wish I was with you to[C]night
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I recall [F]now five [C]long years ago 
When I [G7]left there and I went [C]away
I was too [F]young to [C]see I was wrong 
Oh I [G7]miss you and dad more each [C]day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Don't ever for[F]get in my [C]heart there's regret
It's not [G7]your fault things turned out this [C]way
In the graveyard's a [F]man that [C]died by my hand
We learned [G7]lessons but sometimes they're [C]late
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
This mornin' at [F]dawn I must [C]die for my wrong
Mom [G7]forgive me the pain I've caused [C]you
The time must be [F]near the [C]parson is here
And he's [G7]prayin' like you used to [C]do
{end_of_verse}
