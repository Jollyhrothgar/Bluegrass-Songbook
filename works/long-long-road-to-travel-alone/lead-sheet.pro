{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I always thought I’d [C]like to roam
One [G]day I started [D7]alone
Out [G]in this old [C]wide wicked world
Away [G]from [D7]friends [G]and home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
It’s a long long road to [C]travel alone
And [G]when the day [D7]is gone
No [G]place to pillow [C]my head at night
Only [G]on [D7]the cold [G]cold stone
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I’ve travelled around from [C]town to town
Now it’s [G]time that I [D7]settled down
I’ve [G]had my fill [C]of rambling around
And [G]now I [D7]am [G]homeward bound
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
One day a letter [C]came to me
And [G]this is what [D7]it read
Come [G]home my boy to [C]the old homestead
Your [G]father [D7]and mother [G]are dead
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
It’s been a long road to [C]travel alone
I [G]wish I had [D7]never [G]roamed
I thought I’d soon see my mother and dad
But now I am left alone
{end_of_verse}
