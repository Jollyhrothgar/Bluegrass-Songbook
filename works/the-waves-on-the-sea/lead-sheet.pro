{start_of_chorus}
Oh [G]the waves on the sea how they roll
And [C]the chilly winds how they [G]do blow
My [C]own true love [G]got drownded in the deep
And the ship never [D]got to [G]the shore.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I [G]left my darling grievin’
I [G]left my darling grievin’
I [C]left my darling [G]grievin’ at the deep
And I never expect to [D]see her [G]anymore.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The [G]first on the deck was the captain of the ship
A [C]rough looking fellow [G]was he
Said I [C]care no more for my [G]wife and my child
Than I do for the [D]fish in [G]the sea.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
One cold night as I lay on my bed
I fell so fast asleep
And thoughts of my true love come runnin’ through my head
And poor sailors that sail on the deep.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Oh the moon shines so bright and the stars give us light
And my mother is waiting for me
She may look she may weep she may look to the deep
She may look to the bottom of the sea.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Then three times around turned the gallant old ship
Yes three times around turned she
And as she turned (the) third time around
She sank to the bottom of the sea.
{end_of_verse}
