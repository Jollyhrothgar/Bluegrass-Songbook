{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]The old bar stool's feelin' higher 
Cause I've [C]started sinkin' lower
The [G]minute that she waltzed right through that [D7]door
Not [G]long ago I held her like a [C]fool I went and left her
Now she's [G]with somebody [D7]new out on that [G]floor
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Yes she's got the [C]rhythm and I got the [G]blues
She's showin' me how much I had to [D7]lose
With her [G]every little move she's tellin' [C]me I'm over [A7]you
She's got the [G]rhythm [D7]and I got the [G]blues
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well that music's gettin' louder 
As my [C]heart keeps beatin' faster
As she [G]spells out regret in perfect [D7]time
Well I [G]thought I wanted freedom 
But that [C]ball and chain I need 'em
Cause [G]when you choose [D7]sometimes you lose the [G]prize
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Yes she's got the [C]rhythm and I got the [G]blues
She's showin' me how much I had to [D7]lose
With her [G]every little move she's tellin' [C]me I'm over [A7]you
She's got the [G]rhythm [D7]and I got the [G]blues
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[D7]Yeah with her [G]every little move she's tellin' [C]me I'm over [A7]you
She's got the [G]rhythm [D7]and I got the [G]blues
{end_of_verse}
