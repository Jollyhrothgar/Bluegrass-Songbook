{start_of_verse}
I’d rather be alone and have you dream of me only
Than have you say you’re sorry that we are apart
I’d rather be alone and have you dream of me only
Than to be in your arms but never in your heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Well I’ve just received your letter you asked me to come home
You say you’re sorry that you went away
This is an old old story and I’ve heard it all before
So darlin’ this is all that I can say
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I tried so hard my darlin’ to make you love me then
‘Cause you would always leave me here alone
And although I could forgive you things would be the same
Nothing could ever change your heart of stone
{end_of_verse}
