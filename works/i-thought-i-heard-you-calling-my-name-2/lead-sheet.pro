{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
You [D]said [D7]goodbye to [G]me this morning
With [D]only these words [A]to [A7]explain
You [D]said you [D7]found someone you [G]love better
But I [D]still hear [A7]you’re voice [D]call my name
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
I [D]thought I heard [D7]you call [G]my name
Funny [D]how it still feels [A]this [A7]way
Your [D]voice seems [D7]so close [G]but I knew
That [D]by now you [A7]were many [D]miles away
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I’ll [D]walk through [D7]the streets of [G]the city
People [D]passing by think it’s [A]so [A7]strange
I’m [D]talking but [D7]there’s no one [G]beside me
But I [D]still hear [A7]your voice [D]call my name
{end_of_verse}
