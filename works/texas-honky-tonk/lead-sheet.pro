{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]The jukebox in the corner is playing Whiskey River
The neon star shines bright above the [G7]bar
There's laughing dancing shootin' pool 
Cryin' drinkin' lonely fools 
And people here who don't know where they [C]are
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
It's the kind of place you go to
When you have no one to turn to
To help you ease your [C7]pain and mise[F]ry
It's a [G7]hang out for the loser and a hideout for the boozer
And a place to go for lonely fools like [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
It's just a [F]honky tonk a Texas [C]honky tonk
Where the [G7]flipping of the tops 
And the [C]music never stops
It's just a [F]honky tonk a Texas [C]honky tonk
But [F]it's become my [G7]home since you've been [C]gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I used to think that someday we might get back together
I couldn't stand the thought of losing [G7]you
But I must accept reality you're not coming back to me
You've found your happiness with someone [C]new
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
So I sit here in this same old chair 
Pretending that I just don't care
Trying to for[C7]get your love some[F]how
From the [G7]top of the world to the bottom of a bottle
I've sank too deep to ever pull out [C]now
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
It's just a [F]honky tonk a Texas [C]honky tonk
Where the [G7]flipping of the tops 
And the [C]music never stops
It's just a [F]honky tonk a Texas [C]honky tonk
But [F]it's become my [G7]home since you've been [C]gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Yes [F]it's become my [G7]home since you've been [C]gone
{end_of_verse}
