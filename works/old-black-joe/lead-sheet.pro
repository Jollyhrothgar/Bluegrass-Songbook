{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Gone are [F]the days when my heart was young [C]and gay
Gone from [Dm]this earth to the cotton [G]fields away
Gone from the earth to a better land I know
I [G]hear their [C]gentle [F]voices [C]calling, [G]Old [C]Black Joe
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
I’m coming, I’m coming, for my head is bending low
I [G]hear their [C]gentle [F]voices [C]calling, [G]old [C]black Joe
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Why [C]do I weep, when [F]my heart should feel [C]no pain
Why do I sigh when [Dm]my friends come [G]not again
Grieving [C]for forms now [F]departed [C]long ago
I [G]hear their [C]gentle [F]voices [C]calling, [G]Old [C]Black Joe
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Where [C]are the hearts once [F]so happy and [C]so free
The children so dear that [Dm]I held upon [G]my knee
Gone [C]to the shore where [F]my soul has longed [C]to go
I [G]hear their [C]gentle [F]voices [C]calling, [G]Old [C]Black Joe
{end_of_verse}
