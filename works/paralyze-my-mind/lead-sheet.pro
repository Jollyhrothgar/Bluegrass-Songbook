[C]Come on woman and [G7]paralyze my [C]mind

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Well I just looked out and in my side view [F]mirror
That [G7]binder I just passed it way [C]behind
And each mile my old Jimmy takes me is one mile [F]nearer 
To the [C]gal that's gonna [G7]paralyze my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I [F]left a trail of smoke all the way from [C]Gulfport
And I just [D7]rolled across that Louisiana [G7]line
I can't [C]wait till I can see the lights of [F]Freeport
And the [C]gal that's gonna [G7]paralyze my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
She's a waitress at a place called Jimmy's [F]Truck Stop
So I'm [G7]watching for that truck stop neon [C]sign
That'll let me know I've found my good [F]luck stop
And the [C]gal that's gonna [G7]paralyze my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
She may [F]not have all the looks to win a [C]contest
But as [D7]far as I'm concerned that suits me [G7]fine
How a [C]way a woman looks is only [F]one test
And in [C]other ways she [G7]paralyzed my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Well there's that sign ahead so I better be [F]braking
And [G7]let those trucks catch up I left [C]behind
I'll sit the air and leave old Jimmy [F]shaking
While I [C]let that woman [G7]paralyze my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Come on woman and [G7]paralyze my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}
