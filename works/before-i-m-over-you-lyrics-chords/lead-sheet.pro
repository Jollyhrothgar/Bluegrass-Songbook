{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I just can't get it through my head
[F]You love another now instead
[C]Can't make myself believe we're really [G7]through

[F]Talking to a silent wall
[C]I'll lose my mind [G7]before I'm over [C]you

Chorus
[F]I think I've almost lost my mind
[C]I think about you all the time
[F]I'm going crazy yes I know
[G7]And I don't have far to go
[C]The way you treat me is a shame
[F]But I'll keep loving you the same
[C]I'll lose my mind [G7]before I'm over [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I keep your letters I should burn
[F]I wear your ring I should return
[C]But there's a million foolish things I [G7]do

[F]To know I kiss your photograph
[C]I'll lose my mind [G7]before I'm over [C]you
