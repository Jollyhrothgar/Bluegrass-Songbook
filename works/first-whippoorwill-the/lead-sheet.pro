{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Springtime is near my darling
You say that you are going away
My [Bb]heart [Bb]will [Bb]be [Bb]with [Bb]you [F]my [Bb]darling[Bb]
And I’m counting now the days
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
I know that soon I’ll have to travel
I know I’m over the hill
I [Eb]feel so [Eb]all alone my [Bb]darling said [Bb]she’d be gone
When I [Bb]heard [F]that first [Bb]whippoorwill[Bb]
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The [Bb]flowers are [Bb]blooming [Bb]little [F]darling[Bb]
With the budding of the trees
I hear the night birds a crying
I know that they are warning me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Our love was planted little darling
Just like the farmer plants his grain
But there will never be a harvest
On the hills the whippoorwills now sing
{end_of_verse}
