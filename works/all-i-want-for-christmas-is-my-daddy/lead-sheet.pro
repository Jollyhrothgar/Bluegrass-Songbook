[G]A little boy with [C]tear dimmed [G]eyes 
With trembling lips he could not [G7]hide

[G]All I want for [C]Christmas is my [G]daddy

But don't [D7]forget to bring my daddy Christmas [G]Eve

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Mommy said if [C]I'd be [G]good 
And say my prayers the way I [G7]should

With my daddy far away
Cause we [A7]miss him so and love him oh so [D7]much
