[G]I know that hearts were loving 
Long before I [D7]was here

And I'm not the first to ever cry
In my bed or in my [G]beer

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
There were songs before there was [C]radio
Of [G]love that stays and love that [Em]goes
They were writing melancholy [C]tunes
And tearful words that [D7]rhyme
Before my [G]time   [D7]before my [G]time

Of love that's [D7]always been

Who are now gone with the [G]wind

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Old fashion love words spoken [C]then
Keep [G]coming back around [Em]again
[C]Nothings changed except the names
Their love burns just like [D7]mine
Before my [G]time  [D7]before my [G]time

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
And in the dim of [C]yesterday
[G]I can clearly see
That flesh and blood cried out to [C]someone

I love you till [C]I die
Before my [G]time  [D7]before my [G]time

Is what I feel [D7]for you

In a century or [G]two
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 10}
If someway they had seen [C]and knew
[G]How it would be for me and [Em]you
They'd wish for love like [C]yours
And they would wish for love like [D7]mine
Before my [G]time  [D7]before my [G]time
{end_of_verse}
