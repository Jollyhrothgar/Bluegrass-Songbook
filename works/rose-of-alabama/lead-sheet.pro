{start_of_verse}
Away from Mississippi’s vale
With my ol’ hat there for a sail
I crossed upon a cotton bale
To Rose of Alabama
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I landed on the far sand bank
I sat upon the hollow plank
And there I made the banjo twank
For Rose of Alabama
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Oh brown Rosie
Rose of Alabama
Sweet tobacco posey
Is my Rose of Alabama
Sweet tobacco posey
Is my Rose of Alabama
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
I says to her sit as you please
Across my leg she took her ease
It’s good to go upon the knees
Said Rose of Alabama
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
The river rose the cricket sang
The lightnin’ bug did flash his wing
Then like a rope my arms I fling
Round Rose of Alabama
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
We hugged so long I cannot tell
My Rosie seemed to like it well
My banjo in the river fell
Oh Rose of Alabama
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Like alligator after prey
I dives in but it float away
And all the while it seem to say
Oh Rose of Alabama
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Now every day come rain or shower
I hunt my banjo for an hour
And meet my sweet tobacco flower
Oh Rose of Alabama
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Oh fare thee well you belles of Spain
And fare thee well to Liza Jane
Your charms will all be put to shame
By Rose of Alabama
{end_of_verse}
