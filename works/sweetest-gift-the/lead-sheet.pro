{start_of_verse}
One day a mother came to a prison
To see an erring but precious son
She told the warden how much she loved him
It did not matter what he had done
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
She did not bring to him parole or pardon free
She brought no silver, gold no pomp or style to see
It was a halo bright brought down from heaven’s light
The sweetest gift, a mother’s smile
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
Her boy had drifted far from the fireside
though she had pleaded with him each night
Yet not a word did she ever utter
That told her heartaches her smile was bright
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
She left a smile you can remember
She’s gone to heaven from heartaches free
Those bars around you could never change her
You were her baby and e’er will be
{end_of_verse}
