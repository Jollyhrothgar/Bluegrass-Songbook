[G]I had a dream last night that I held [C]you
And you [G]still seemed as handsome to [D7]me

It's just [G]another Crazy [D7]Dream for [G]me

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Crazy Dreams linger [C]on 
As I face an empty [G]dawn
With no end to it all can I [D7]see
For I've surely reached the [C]end 
Lost your love to a [G]friend
Just another Crazy [D7]Dream for [G]me
{end_of_verse}

Once you were mine and we were so [C]happy
I never [G]thought that the end soon would [D7]be
But [G]now that you're gone and I'm so [C]lonesome
Its' just [G]another Crazy [D7]Dream for [G]me
{end_of_verse}

Just another Crazy [D7]Dream for [G]me
