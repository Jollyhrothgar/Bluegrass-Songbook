{start_of_verse}
Let me rest at the end of my journey
I’m weary, tired, and old
Let me rest at the end of my journey
Heaven is my home and my goal
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Old paint is tired, his feet are all sore
We’ll ride the range no more
Let me rest at the end of my journey
Heaven is my home and my goal
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
A cowboy’s life on the old Texas trail
Herding doggies is all that he knows
A cowboy’s life on the old cattle trail
Leads from Texas to old Mexico
{end_of_verse}
