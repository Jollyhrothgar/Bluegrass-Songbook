{start_of_verse}
Sad songs and teardrops will surely mend this broken heart
Time forgets these bitter things I feel
But your days are numbered
you learned your lesson well
When you finally play a heart that plays for real
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
There’s a new fool somewhere waiting
For you old fashioned heart-break love affair
He’ll see through your intentions
with each lie that you tell
And the old ways will go out with the new somewhere
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Leavin’ was so easy
but old hands do make fancy moves
Enough for one fell victim to your game
But someday you’ll see
that cold hearts can be broken too
And what goes ’round must come around your way
{end_of_verse}
