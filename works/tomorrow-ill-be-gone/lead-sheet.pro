{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Lost like a grain of sand [C]upon the sands [G]of time
Trusting and believing in a love I thought was [D]mine
Tossed [G]just like a ship by [C]the waves of [G]a storm
To find the way home, but [D]to-morrow I’ll [G]be gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
I’ll be [C] gone when your blinded [G]eyes open wide to see
You’re a loser in this game of love you played so [D]carelessly
You [G]thought your new love faithful, like [C]a bird it [G]has flown
And now you’re left alone, and [D]tomorrow I’ll [G]be gone.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus}
Gone like the leaves in the fall, [C]to return [G]no more
That is how she left you, like the others [D]before
Hopeless [G]love have [C]I, now it [G]has torn
My heart in little pieces, and [D]tomorrow I’ll [G]be gone.
{end_of_chorus}
