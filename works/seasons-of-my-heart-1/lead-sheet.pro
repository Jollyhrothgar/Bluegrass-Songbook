{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]The seasons come the seasons go 
We get a little sunshine [F]rain and [C]snow 
Just the way that it was planned [G7]to be 
But there's no [C]seasons in my heart
While you play the [F]leading [C]part 
For the flowers will [G7]bloom [C]eternally 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Your [F]leaving it will bring autumn [C]sorrow 
And my tears like withered leaves will [G7]fall 
But [F]spring it could bring some glad [C]tomorrow 
And darling we could be [G7]happy after [C]all 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
As it is in natures plan
No season gets the [F]upper [C]hand
How I tried to keep this fact [G7]in mind 
The trees are [C]bare the cold winds blow 
And by experience [F]we should [C]know 
That winter comes but the [G7]spring is close [C]behind 
{end_of_verse}
