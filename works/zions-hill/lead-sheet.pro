{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
There [C]awaits [F]for me a glad [C]tomorrow
Where the gates of pearl swing open wide
And when I have passed this spell [F]of sorrow
I will [C]camp [G7]upon the [C]other side
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Someday [F]beyond the reach [C]of mortal kin
Someday God only knows just where or [G7]when
The [C]wills of mortal life [F]will all [C]stand still
And I shall go dwell on [G7]Zion’s [C]Hill
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Someday the [F]storm clouds will [C]be lifted
Beyond the shadow of the tomb
And with all the bells of Heaven [F]ringing
And the [C]angels [G7]singing “Home [C]Sweet Home”
{end_of_verse}
