{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]When I come home at night [D7]I find him sitting there
Looking at the paper in my favorite [G]chair
He's drinking up my coffee [C]wearing my house shoes
He's the [G]fellow [D7]they call Mister [G]Blues
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]Since you went away he's been living here with [G]me
[C]Wish that he'd go home [G]wherever that may [D7]be
I [G]don't mean to be unkind but he's got [C]nothing I can use
So won't you come on [G]back sweetheart [D7]and run off Mister [G]Blues
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now when I go to bed [D7]into my room he creeps
Repeating all the gossip he's picked up on the [G]street
All through the night he tells me that [C]things they say you do
He knows that I still [G]love you [D7]and I hate this kind of [G]news
