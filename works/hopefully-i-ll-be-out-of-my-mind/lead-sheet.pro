{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I had two cups of [D7]coffee this [G]morning
Before a single [G7]tear filled [C]my eyes[Am]
So I [C]know your memory is [G]dimming
Cause [A7]today I've only prayed once to [D7]die

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You're [G]losing this [D7]hold you [G]have on me
You see I'm [G7]forgetting [C]with time[Am]
[C]One more day of [G]hurting for [C]you
Hopefu[G]lly (hopefully) I'll be [D7]out of my [G]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Two years is a [D7]long time to [G]want you
Without you in these [G7]two arms [C]of mine
Desire still fills my [G]body
But [A7]maybe I'll lose that with my [D7]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Then when [G]day be[D7]comes to[G]morrow
And my heart beats for the [G7]very first [C]time
