{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I want so much to [D7]believe the things you're [G]saying
But [D7]I know if I did I'd be a [G]fool
That [C]bottle on the table is the [G]reason
It's the [C]wine that's [G]talking  [D7]it isn't really [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You never tell me that you [D7]care when you're not [G]drinking
You [D7]always wait until you've had a [G]few
That's the [C]time that you give out with all the [G]sweet talk
It's the [C]wine that's [G]talking  [D7]it isn't really [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
When [D7]you pour out your heart [C]without the tinkling [G]glasses
That's the [C]day I’ll know your [G]love is really [D7]true
But [G]when you're like you are now [C]your words mean nothing [G]to me
It's the [C]wine that's [G]talking  [D7]it isn't really [G]you
It's the [C]wine that's [G]talking  [D7]it isn't really [G]you
{end_of_verse}
