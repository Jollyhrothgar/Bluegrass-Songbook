{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I left my old [D]home to ramble this country
My mother and [G]dad said son don’t go [D]wrong
Remember that [G]God will always [D]watch o’er you
And we will be [A]waiting for you here [D]at home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Son don’t go [G]astray was what they [D]both told me
Remember that [A]love for God can be [D]found
But now they’re both [G]gone this letter [D]just told me
For [D]years they’ve [A]been dead, the fields have turned brown
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
For many long years this world I have rambled
No thoughts of [G]the day when I would [D]return
Now as I go [G]home and find no one [D]waiting
The price I have [A]paid to live and [D]to learn
{end_of_verse}
