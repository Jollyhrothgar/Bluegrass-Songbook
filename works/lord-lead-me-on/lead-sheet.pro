{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
When the [G]way seems dark and long
Hold to my [D]hand dear Lord [G]I pray
Give me [G]grace to shout and shine
Ever [G]in the life devine
Lord lead me on from [D]day [G]to day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Oh lead me on from [D]day [G]to day
I want to [C]walk the [G]holy way
Oh friends [G]forsake me all along
I asked the [C]Lord to lead [G]me on
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
In this [G]world of doubt and gloom
When all [G]flowers start to bloom
Hold to my [D]hand dear Lord [G]I pray
I have [G]put my faith in thee
‘Til [G]the homely hour shall be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Lord lead me on from [D]day [G]to day
When old [G]age is feeling on
And my [G]strength is almost gone
Hold to [D]my hand dear [G]I pray
Surely [G]thou will n’er forsake
And in [G]heaven I’ll awake
Lord lead me on from [D]day [G]to day
{end_of_verse}
