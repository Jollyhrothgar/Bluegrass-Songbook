{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Once [G]I loved your [C]fond affection
All my hopes on you was spent
Till a dark eyed girl persuaded
And you care no more for me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Go on and leave me if [C]you wish to
Never [C]let me cross [Em]your mind
In your heart to love another
Never on earth will I call you mine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
When I’m dead and in my coffin
And my pale face towards the sun
Will you come and sit beside me
And think of what you’ve done
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
When I’m dead and in my coffin
And the shroud about me bows
Will you come and scatter roses
Upon your lover’s mound
{end_of_verse}
