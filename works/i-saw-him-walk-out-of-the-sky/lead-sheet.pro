{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I’ve been searching so long for the words to describe 
The dream I was given one [D7]night 
But I [G]found none sufficient to tell what I felt 
When I saw Him [D7]walk out of the [G]sky 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I dreamed we had gathered at the old meeting house 
My family my dear friends and [D7]I 
We had [G]gone there to worship at the close of the day 
When I saw Him [D7]walk out of the [G]sky 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The [C]church door was open and the [G]singing began 
Then the loud sound of thunder drew [D7]nigh 
I [G]looked out through the night and the Heavens grew bright 
Then I saw Him [D7]walk out of the [G]sky 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I wanted to shout oh look He’s returned
But my lips could not utter a [D7]sound 
I [G]wanted to tell them to look toward the sky 
And behold what I [D7]saw coming [G]down 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Oh the [C]brightness around Him can [G]not be described
And the wonders untold though I [D7]tried 
It’s a [G]dream I will treasure as long as I live 
When I saw Him [D7]walk out of the [G]sky 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
It’s a dream I will treasure as long as I live 
When I saw Him [D7]walk out of the [G]sky
