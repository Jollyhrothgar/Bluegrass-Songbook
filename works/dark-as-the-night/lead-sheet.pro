{start_of_verse}
Dark as the night and blue as the day
I’m lonesome my darling since you went away
Sometimes I wonder what made you stray
Dark as the night and blue as the day.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Blue as the sky there’s blues in my heart
Yes it’s dark outside since we’ve been apart
Oh tell me please tell me why did you stray
Dark as the night I’m blue as the day.
{end_of_chorus}
