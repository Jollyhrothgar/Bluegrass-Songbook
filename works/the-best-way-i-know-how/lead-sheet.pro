{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I look up and there you stand before [D7]me
[G]Looking so surprised at what your [D7]see
Did you [C]really think I'd be the same without [D7]you
And [C]stay the way that you remember [D7]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I had [C]reasons for resisting all [D7]temptations
And the [C]reason's standing right before me [D7]now
And I [G]hope you take [C]into [D7]consideration
That I'm [C]getting by the [D7]best way I know [G]how
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
All the empty bottles on the [D7]table
[G]And I seldom ever shave or comb my [D7]hair
No I [C]didn't drink so much that I'm not [D7]able
It's [C]just that I'm not going [D7]anywhere
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Seeing [C]me like this I hope you won't feel [D7]guilty
And don't [C]blame yourself for what I'm doing [D7]now
I'm just [G]right back where I was [C]before you met [D7]me
And I'm [C]getting by the [D7]best way I know [G]how
And I'm [C]getting by the [D7]best way I know [G]how
{end_of_verse}
