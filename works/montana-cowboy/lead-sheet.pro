{start_of_verse}
For many long years I played the lone hand
I rode my horse in many strange lands
Until one day I stopped for awhile
For two blue eyes and sunny smile
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
So howl away you old coyote
I hear your sad and lonesome song
‘a calling me back to old Montana
Back to those hills where I belong
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
One day I rode away from home
I’m a traveling back but it won’t be long
I’ll see you again in a little while
You’re my darling sweet my sunny smile
{end_of_verse}
