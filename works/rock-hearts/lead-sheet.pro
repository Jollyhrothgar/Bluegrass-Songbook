{start_of_verse}
Why did you break my heart and throw it down
Why did you spread the news all over town
Why did you make me your laughing stock
Because you’ve got a heart of rock
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Rock hearts will break believe it my dear
And yours will break in two I fear
And when it does dear don’t run to me
For it will be too late you see
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
You didn’t break my heart by running round
Another new love you have not found
You only handed me back a lock
You had around your heart of rock
{end_of_verse}
