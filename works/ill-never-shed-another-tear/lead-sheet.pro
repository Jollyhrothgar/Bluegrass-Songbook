{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I [G]used to sit alone at night [C]and worry [G]little darling
For I thought you meant the world to [D7]me
But [G]now things have changed and [C]those days are gone [G]forever
So I’ll never [D7]shed [G]another tear
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
I’ll never shed another tear now I [C]don’t care [G]what happens
You have proved your love untrue to [D7]me
There’s [G]nothing you can do that [C]will ever change [G]my feelings
So I’ll never [D7]shed [G]another tear
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
With a broken heart I’ll never forget the [C]vows we [G]made together
The many times you told me not to [D7]fear
But [G]now you’ve forgotten and [C]you’ve left me here [G]forever
So I’ll never [D7]shed [G]another tear
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now you should have told me dear that [C]you were [G]only fooling
Then I’d never learn to love you [D7]so
Then [G]I wouldn’t have all [C]these heartaches [G]my darling
Dreading the [D7]day I see [G]you go
{end_of_verse}
