{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I [C]heard the laughter at the [F]depot
But my tears [G]fell like the [C]rain
When I saw them place the [F]casket
In the baggage coach of [G]the evening [C]train
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The baby’s eyes were red from weepin
His little heart is filled with pain
Oh dad he cried they’re takin mama
Away from us on the evening train
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I turned to walk away from the depot
It seems I heard here call my name
Take care of baby and tell him daring
That I’m goin home on the evening train
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I pray that god will give me courage
To carry on til we meet again
It’s hard to know she’s gone forever
They’re carryin her home on the evening train
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I [C]heard the laughter at the [F]depot
But my tears [G]fell like the [C]rain
When I saw them place the [F]casket
In the baggage coach of [G]the evening [C]train
