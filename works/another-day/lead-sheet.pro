{start_of_verse}
Another day how can I stand it
Without my ba-by by my side
This empty fee-lin’ now inside
Is bound to show what I can’t hide
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Just make mine straight without a chaser
And let me drown my blues this way
My darlin’s gone my life is empty
Nothing to live for another day
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
A thief could rob and take my money
If death was pending I could pray
I’m helpless now what will my fate be
As the hours drag by another day
{end_of_verse}
