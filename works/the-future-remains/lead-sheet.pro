{start_of_verse}
As the clouds of the morning they roll up the mountain
I feel that my heart is at rest
I know that some day I will drink from the fountain
And live in the home of the blessed
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
When everything’s lost the future remains
Oh listen poor wandering soul
I read in the bible and there it explains
The pathway and the streets made of gold
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
You may have to struggle and overcome hardships
That hang over you like a cloud
Your burdens are lighter your soul will shine brighter
If salvation you have found
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Don’t ever give up on the right road to glory
Cause maybe you’ve stumbled and strayed
Just remember our Savior and His humbling story
And you will reach Heaven someday
{end_of_verse}
