[C]I pack my saddle throw it in that two horse trailer
[F]Back up my truck hook 'em up and drive [C]away 
Won't be the first time but this times the last time

I ain't her cowboy any[C]more

Never saw it comin' but I knew where it was goin'
[F]When she asked how long this time before I hit the [C]road
She didn't come right out and say it but I sure got the message
[F]When I reached out to hold her that shoulder sure was [C]cold
[G7]Figured I'd just let goodbye run its course
I ain't her cowboy any[C]more

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
These [F]white lines are a blur 
Like the last few nights I spent with her
I [Am]don't know where I went [G7]wrong or if I [F]did
Like the good ol' boy I am
I told her that I understand 
But [Am]lord knows that I [G7]won't long as I [F]live
Seems [Dm]lately every time it rains it [G7]pours 
I ain't her cowboy any[C]more

We met in Denver settled down in Dallas
[F]The best days of my life were the ones I spent with [C]her
You'd think that all that lovin' ought to count for something

That [G7]Casper sunset's what I'm shootin' for
Cause I ain't her cowboy any[C]more
