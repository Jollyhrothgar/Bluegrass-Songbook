[C]Listening while the jukebox [G]play
[C]The songs I like to [D7]hear when I'm [G]alone

[D7]And then my poor heart skipped a beat
[C]She took the table next to [G]me
[C]She didn't even [D7]notice I was [G]there
[D7]She looked around and just by chance
[C]Our eyes met in a casual [G]glance
[C]She smiled and it was [D7]more than I could [G]bare

[D7]How could she know the way I feel
{end_of_verse}

To her I'm just a friend
[C]Heartbreak can't be far [D7]away
[C]'Cause heartaches [D7]just walked [G]in
