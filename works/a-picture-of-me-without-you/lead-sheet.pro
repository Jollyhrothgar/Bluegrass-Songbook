{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Imagine a world where no music [C]was [G]playing
[D7]Then think of a church with nobody's praying
[G]If you've ever looked up [G7]at a sky [C]with no [G]blue
[D7]Then you've seen a picture of me without [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]Have you walked in a garden where nothing was [G]growing
[D7]Or stood by a river when nothing was flowing
[G]If you've seen a [G7]red rose [C]unkissed by the [G]dew
[D7]Then you've seen a picture of [G]me without [G7]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[C]Can you picture Heaven with no angels [G]singing
[D7]Or a quiet Sunday morning with no church bells ringing
[G]If you've watched as the [G7]heart of a [C]child breaks in [G]two
[D7]Then you've seen a picture of me [C]without [G]you
{end_of_verse}
