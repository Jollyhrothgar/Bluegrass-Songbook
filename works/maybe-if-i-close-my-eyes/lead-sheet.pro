{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Maybe if I [F]close my eyes [G7]it will go [C]away
If I pretend [F]there never was a [G7]thing tween you and [C]me
But I can't sleep and [F]I can't eat it [G7]haunts me night and [C]day
But maybe if I [F]close my eyes [G7]it will go [C]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You say [G7]you're a fascination that [F]I will soon [C]regret
That it [G7]won't be long and I'll forget you [F]ever did [C]exist
But when I love I [F]really love yes [G7]I'll go all the [C]way
But maybe if I [F]close my eyes [G7]it will go [C]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
You say [G7]that I must accept the truth 
That [F]you're not coming [C]back
Be [G7]reasonable at my age and [F]faithful to the [C]fact
But when I love I [F]really love yes [G7]I'll go all the [C]way
But maybe if I [F]close my eyes [G7]it will go [C]away
{end_of_verse}
