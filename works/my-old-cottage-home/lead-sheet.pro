{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I am thinking tonight of an [A]old cottage home
That [E]stands on the brow of [B7]the hill
Where in [E]life’s early morning [A]I once loved to roam
But [E]now all [B7]is quiet [E]and still
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Oh my old cottage home my [A]old cottage home
That [E]stands on the brow of [B7]the hill
Where in [E]life’s early morning [A]I once loved to roam
But [E]now all [B7]is quiet [E]and still
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Many years have gone by since in [A]prayer there I knelt
With [E]dear ones around the [B7]old hearth
But my [E]mother’s sweet prayers in [A]my heart still are felt
I’ll [E]treasure [B7]them awhile [E]on earth
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
One by one they have gone from the [A]old cottage home
On [E]earth we shall see them [B7]no more
But we’ll [E]meet them again on [A]that beautiful shore
Where [E]partings [B7]will come [E]never more
{end_of_verse}
