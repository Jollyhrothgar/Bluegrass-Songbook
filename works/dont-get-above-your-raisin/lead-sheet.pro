{start_of_verse}
Now I got a gal that’s sweet to me,
But she just ain’t what she used to be
Just a little high headed; That’s plain to see
Don’t get above your raisin’ Stay down to earth with me.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Now looky here gal don’t you high head me
For I ain’t forgot how you used to be
When you didn’t have nothin’ That was plain to see
Don’t get above your raisin’ Stay down to earth with me.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
You need not hold your head so high
Every time you pass me by
For that don’t mean nothin To me you see
Don’t get above your raisin’ Stay down to earth with me.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Now looky here gal you’d better be yourself
And leave that other stuff on the shelf
You’re a country baby That’s plain to see
Don’t get above your raisin’ Stay down to earth with me
{end_of_verse}
