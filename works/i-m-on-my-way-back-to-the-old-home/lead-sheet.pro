{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Back in the days of my [C]childhood
In the [G]evening when everything was [D7]still
I [G]used to sit and listen to the fox [C]hounds
With my [G]dad in the old [D7]Kentucky [G]hills
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I'm on my way back to the old [C]home
That [G]road winds on up the [D7]hill
But [G]there's no light in the [C]window
That [G]shined long ago [D7]where I [G]lived
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Soon my childhood days were [C]over
I [G]had to leave my old [D7]home
For [G]my mom and dad were called to [C]heaven
I was [G]left in this [D7]world all [G]alone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I'm on my way back to the old [C]home

That [G]shined long ago [D7]where I [G]lived
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
High in the hill of old [C]Kentucky
Stands [G]a foggy thought in my [D7]memory
I'm [G]on my way back to the old [C]home
That [G]light in the [D7]window I long to [G]see
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I'm on my way back to the old [C]home

But [G]there's no light in the [C]window
That [G]shined long ago [D7]where I [G]lived
{end_of_verse}
