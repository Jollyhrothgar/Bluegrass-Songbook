{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I just came to smell the flowers
Here in [F]someone's darkest [C]hour
I don't even know the one they've laid to [G7]rest
But any[C]where there's a crowd
And any[F]where they're crying [C]loud
Just seems to be the [G7]place I love the [C]best
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Su[F]rrounded by the blues in a [C]place that losers choose
Where one smile cost at least a million [G7]tears
[C]Look into my past in the [F]bottom of a [C]glass
The only place I've [G7]looked in many [C]years
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now the ground don't seem so very [F]low
When you're down [C]about as far as you can go
And it's pretty hard to smile 
While the [G7]whole world laughs in your face
And [C]with no will left to live 
The world moves [F]fast where you lie [C]still
Too weak to stand 
And just not enough [G7]woman to join the [C]race
{end_of_verse}
