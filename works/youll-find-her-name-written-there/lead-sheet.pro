{start_of_verse}
No more no more she’ll walk this earth
Her face like a beautiful flower
But all alone there’s a marble stone
You’ll find her name written there
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
A new voice rings where the angel sings
A voice so pure and so fair
But if you look in the heavenly book
You’ll find her name written there
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I’m all alone since the dawn of fate
Left me in the deepest despair
But if you wait at the pearly gates
You’ll find her name written there
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I breathe her name into the air
It goes and I know not where
But if you look to the heart of a friend
You’ll find her name written there
{end_of_verse}
