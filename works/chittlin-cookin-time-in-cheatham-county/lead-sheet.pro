There’s a quiet [Dm]and peaceful county in the state of Tennessee

When it’s [Dm]chittlin’ cookin’ time in cheatham county
I’ll be courtin’ in them cheatham county [G7]hills
And I’ll [Dm]pick a cheatham county chittlin’ cooker
I’ve a [Dm]longin’ that [A7]the chittlin’s [Dm]will [A7]fill[Dm]

There’s an art in chittlin’ cookin’ and all good chittlin cooks

In the [Dm]hills of cheatham county in sunny Tennessee
When chittlin’s are in season is where I long to be

Of all [Dm]good things put be for me

And [Dm]when I press that dying pillow
Let [Dm]chittlin’s by [A7]my [Dm]last [A7]request[Dm]
