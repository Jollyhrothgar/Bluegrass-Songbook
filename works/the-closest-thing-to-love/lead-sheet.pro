{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]It's not the kind you've read about
[G7]It's story books and fairy [Am]tales[C]
By [F]now you know it's not the kind
That [C]poets write about in love [G7]songs
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
It's [C]not exactly what you wish for[G7]
If you [E7]tossed a penny in a [Am]wishing well[C]
But [F]if it isn't love
It's the [Dm]closest thing to [G7]love I've ever [C]known [F]  [Am]   [G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Lord [C]knows I'll never be one
Of the [G7]world's legendary [Am]heroes [G7]
And my [F]way of life may not exactly [C]be
[E7]What you had your [G7]heart set on
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]Still you're here with me
And [G7]indeed there's bound to be a better [Am]tomorrow[G7]   [C]
And [F]if that isn't love
It's the [Dm]closest thing to [G7]love I've ever [C]known[G7]   [C]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[F]Just like the [G7]wind love could be [C]wondering
[D7]There are no ties [G7]here that will [C]bind
[B7]Still you choose to [E7]stay with [Am]me  [C]
And a [D7]greater love will last
No man could ever [G]find
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
I [C]know there are days in [G7]your life
When you're [Am]bound to hate me[C]
[F]There are days in mine I [C]feel
I face the [D7]world alone[G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
What [C]makes it all worthwhile 
Are the [G7]mornings when your smile [Am]gently wakes me[C]
And [F]if that isn't love
It's the [Dm]closest thing to [G7]love I've ever [C]known
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
Yes [F]you're the closest thing to love
[Dm]The closest thing to [G7]love I've ever [C]known
{end_of_verse}
