{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Papa’s [Gm]name Hannibal Mama was a [Cm]Hanamurai
Everything we owned got all burned up in [D]the great depression [Gm]fire
Strip [Gm]mines and one crop farming drained the [Cm]green earth dry
We lost it all but only love was left [D]cause that’s the one thing money [Gm]can’t buy
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Yeah [Gm]we’re all dustbowl children
Singing [Gm]a dust bowl children
When [Gm]the crops won’t grow
And the dust just blows
When the [Cm]green fields are gone
When the green grass growing [D]fields are gone
When the [Cm]green fields are gone
When the green grass growing [D]fields are gone
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Well they say in California there’s work of every kind
Well the only job I got out there was waiting in a welfare line
Well once I had a dollar once I had a dream
Now every kind of work is done by great machines
{end_of_verse}
