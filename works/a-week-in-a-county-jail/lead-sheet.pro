[G]Doo do do  doo do do doo do oooh wooo

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
One time I spent a week inside [C]a little county [G]jail 
And I don't guess [C]I'll ever live it [G]down 
I was sitting at a red light [C]when these two men came and got [G]me
And [C]said that I was speeding through their [D7]town
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G]Well they said tomorrow morning you [C]can see the judge then [G]go
They let me call one [C]person on the [G]phone
I thought I'd be there [C]overnight so I just called my [G]boss
To [C]tell him I'd be off but not for [D7]long
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[G]They motioned me inside a [C]cell with seven other [G]guys
And one little barred up [C]window in the [G]rear
My cell mate said if they had [C]let me bring some money [G]in
We [C]ought to send the jailer for some [D7]beer
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[G]Well I had to pay him double cause [C]he was the man in [G]charge
And the jailer's job was [C]not the best in [G]town
Later on his wife brought [C]hot baloney eggs and [G]gravy
The [C]first day I was there I turned it [D7]down
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
[G]Next morning they just let us sleep [C]but I was up real [G]early
Wondering when I'd [C]get my [G]release
Later on we got more [C]hot baloney eggs n' [G]gravy
By [C]now I wasn't quite so hard to [D7]please 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
[G]Two days later when I thought [C]that I had been [G]forgotten
The sheriff came in [C]chewing on a [G]straw
He said where is the guy [C]who thinks that this is [G]Indianapolis
I'd [C]like to talk to him about the [D7]law
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
[G]Well I told him who I was and [C]told him I was working [G]steady
And I [C]really should be getting on my [G]way
That part about me being who [C]I was did not impress [G]him 
He [C]said the judge would be here any [D7]day 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 9}
[G]The jailer had a wife and let [C]me tell ya she was [G]awful 
But she brought that hot [C]baloney every [G]day 
And after seven days she [C]got to looking so much [G]better
I [C]asked her if she'd like to run [D7]away 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 10}
[G]Next morning that ole judge took [C]every nickel that I [G]had
And he said son let this [C]teach you not to [G]race
The jailer's wife was smiling [C]from the window as I [G]left 
In [C]thirty minutes I was outta [D7]state 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 11}
[G]Doo do do  doo do do doo do doo dooo
{end_of_verse}
