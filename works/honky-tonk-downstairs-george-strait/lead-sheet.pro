{start_of_verse: Verse}
[G]Well, it won't be long [G7]now
U[C]ntill that old sun goes [G]down
And darkness helps me hide my shameful [D7]tears
My [G]wife works all n[G7]ight long
For a m[C]an who's halfway [G]gone
She's the barmaid in the [D7]honky-tonk down[G]stairs
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
It's a [C]shame she wears the name
Of a [G]man who's locked and chained
To a bottle [C]that's de[G]stroying all hopes and [D7]cares
To the [G]men with hungry eyes
She [C]works and hides her [G]pride
She's the barmaid in the [D7]honky-tonk down[G]stairs
