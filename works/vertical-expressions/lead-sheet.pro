{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G7]When she [C]asked me to dance I said no no I have two left [G7]feet
And she took my hand and whispered a song so [C]sweet
She said [F]hold me as close as you can till my bodies on [C]fire[Am]
It's just a [C]vertical expression [G7]of horizontal [C]desire[G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
So we [C]moved like water bein' poured over polished [G7]steel
And I really can't translate the way she made me [C]feel
And the [F]music played on and the mercury just went [C]higher [Am]
It's just a [C]vertical expression [G7]of horizontal [C]desire
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
We did the [F]Samba the Mambo
The Tango the Two-Step while we ro[C]manced
And when the [F]music got fast
We just [Dm]held to each other and [G7]slow danced
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I took [C]nothing for granted but I wished I could stay all [G7]night
And as we walked in to her place she reached out to dim the [C]light
She said [F]dance with me darlin' till the moon and the stars [C]retire[Am]
It's just a [C]vertical expression [G7]of horizontal [C]desire[G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
It's just a [C]vertical expression [G7]of horizontal [C]desire
{end_of_verse}
