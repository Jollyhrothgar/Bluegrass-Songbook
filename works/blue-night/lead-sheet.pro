{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Blue [G]night I got you on my mind
Blue night I can’t keep from [C]crying
You [G]met [C]someone that [G]was new
You quit someone that you knew was true
Blue [G]night I got you on my mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Blue night blue as I can be
I don’t know what’ll become of [C]me
Where [G]we used to [C]walk I [G]walk alone
With an aching heart because my love is gone
Blue night blue as I can be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Blue night ’cause I’m all alone
I used to call you on the [C]telephone
I [G]used to call and it [C]made [G]you glad
Now I call and it makes you mad
Blue night ’cause I’m all alone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Blue night all by myself
Since you put me on that [C]shelf
There’s [G]just one thing [C]that you [G]must know
You’re gonna reap just what you sow
Blue night, all by myself
Blue night, all by myself
{end_of_verse}
