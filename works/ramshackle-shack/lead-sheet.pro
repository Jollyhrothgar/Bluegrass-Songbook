{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
There’s [A]a ramshackle shack down in old [D]Caroline
And it’s callin’ me [A]back to that sweetheart [E]of mine
Those pretty blue eyes I long to see
Down in old [A]Caroline [E]there I long [A]to be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Those pretty [A]blue eyes that sparkle with [D]love
Sent down to [A]me from Heaven [E]above
And if I had [A]wings like a beautiful [D]dove
I’d fly away to [A]the [E]girl [A]I love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
When the [A]whippoorwills call at the close of [D]day
We would sing love [A]songs and she would [E]say
My love [A]for you will never [D]die
Then we bid [A]farewell [E]such a sad [A]good-bye
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
When it’s [A]harvest time down in old [D]Caroline
I’ll be driftin’ [A]back to that sweetheart [E]of mine
Spend the rest of my [A]days with the girl that [D]I love
With the help of the [A]Lord [E]up in Heaven [A]above
{end_of_verse}
