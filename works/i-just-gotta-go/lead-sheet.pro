{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Well my feet just started walking toward that shiny railroad track 
When I hopped aboard a freight I know I won't be coming back
Cause there's [F]lots of new places that I've just gotta see
And there's [C]lots of the same just waiting there for me
And there's [G7]something o're the mountain that's calling me I know
And [C]honey I just [G7]gotta [C]go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Well my mind just starts to wondering back to that old black coal train
When I hop aboard a freight I know I won't see you again
Cause there [F]something over mountains that I have never seen
And there's [C]lots of new places where I have never dreamed
And it [G7]gets the blood a-running in my veins I know
And [C]honey I just [G7]gotta [C]go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well my feet just started walking toward that shiny railroad track

And there's [G7]something o're the mountain that's calling me I know
