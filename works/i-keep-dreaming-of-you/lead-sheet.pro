[G]In my dreams an [C]old friend came to [G]see you
Right [D7]from the start he was the stealing [G]kind
You'll never know how [C]much it hurt [G]me darling
The [D7]night you left these loving arms of [G]mine

I keep dreaming of you all the [C]time
[D7]Then and only then you're really [G]mine
There's sadness when you go away and [C]I face another day
Yet I keep [G]dreaming of [D7]you all the [G]time
{end_of_verse}

Last night again I [C]dreamed we were [G]together
I [D7]held you close the way I used to [G]do
I kissed your lips and [C]said I found my [G]heaven
You [D7]whispered low how much you love me [G]too
