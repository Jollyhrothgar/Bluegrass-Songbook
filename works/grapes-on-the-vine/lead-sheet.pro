{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
There [C/G]are songs that birds don’t sing to people
There are secrets [F]you keep right through to the end
There are heros [G]they hide until forever
And I’m singin’ this song for one of [C/G]them
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
He’s [C/G]the man that you passed on the road there
The [F]one with his life on the loose
Goin’ [G]either somewhere or nowhere
Goin’ without me without [C/G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
For [C/G]he is this world’s constant orphan
Travelin’ [F]out his long time
Livin’ [G]on apples from orchards
And dyin’ from grapes on the [C/G]vine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
You [C/G]can find [Am]him in big city [F]winters
Out [C/G]where the mission bell [G]crys
And sorrow [Am]echos through the [F]suburbs
And tries to [G]close all his [C/G]eyes
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
And dream of his railroad existance
As if it were some kind of dream
As if the extent of the distance
Were what his heart would go him
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
You [C/G]can find [Am]him in Pittsburg at [F]Christmas
You can find him [C/G]in Buffalo in [G]June
And he knows [Am]all the back roads between [F]them
Like a Gypsy he pulls a broom
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
And it’s route [Am]twenty-two [F]all over again
Stake it well down [G]and try to look like [C/G]sombody’s friend
Look strong at [Am]the men smile [F]for the girls
Puzzle at [G]the rest of the [C/G]world
{end_of_verse}
