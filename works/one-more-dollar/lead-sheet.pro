{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
A [D]long time [A]ago I left [D]my home
For a [G]job [A]in [D]the fruit trees
I [D]missed those hills with [A]the [D]windy pines
For [G]their [A]song [D]seemed to suit me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [D]sent my [A]wages to [D]my home
Said we’d [G]soon [A]be [D]together
For the [D]next good crop  [A]would pay [D]my way
I’ll be [G]coming [A]home [D]forever
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
One [Bm]more [A]dime [G]to [A]show [D]for my day
One [Bm]more [A]dollar [G]and [A]I’m [D]on my way
When [Bm]I reach [G]those hills [A]boys I’ll [D]never roam
One [Bm]more [A]dollar [G]and [A]I’m [D]going home
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
No [D]work said the [A]boss at the bunk [D]house door
There’s a [G]freeze [A]on [D]the branches
When the [D]dice came out at [A]the bar [D]downtown
I [G]rolled [A]and I took [D]my chances
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
A [D]long time [A]ago I left [D]my home
Just a [G]boy [A]passing [D]twenty
Could you [D]spare a coin and [A]a [D]Christian prayer
For my [G]luck [A]has [D]turned against me
{end_of_verse}
