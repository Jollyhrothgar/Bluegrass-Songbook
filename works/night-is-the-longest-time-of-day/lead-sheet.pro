{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[D7]When the [G]daylight is gone and you've [Am]got no place to go
Like the [D7]sun in the west your heart is sinking [G]low
You think that the nighttime is to [Am]hide your lonely tears
And you [D7]think that darkness is for crying lonely [G]tears
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But there is always time for [Am]one more sorrow song
[D7]After the blue lights have gone [G]down[D7]
There is [G]always time for [Am]one more year alone
If [D7]your time has finally come [G]around[D7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
There is [G]always time for [Am]one more tender kiss
When the [D7]lights have gone out all over [G]town[D7]
So [G]spend your night loving not [Am]crying your life away
Cause the [G]night is the [D7]longest time of [G]day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
So spend your night loving not [Am]crying your life away
Cause the [G]night is the [D7]longest time of [G]day
Cause the night is the [D7]longest time of [G]day
