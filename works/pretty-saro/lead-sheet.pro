{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
When [G]I first [Am]came to [C]this country [D]in 1849
I saw [G]many [Am]fair lovers but [C]I did [D]not see mine
I [G]viewed the [Am]world ’round me [C]saw I was [D]quite alone
And [G]me a [Am]poor stranger [C]and a long way [D]from home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh my [G]true love she don’t [Am]want me and [C]it’s this I [D]understand
She [G]wants a [Am]freeholder [C]and I have [D]no land
But [G]I could [Am]maintain [C]her on [D]silver and gold
And [G]all of the [Am]other things that [C]my love’s house [D]could hold
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Oh I [G]wish I was a [Am]little [C]dove, had wings and [D]could fly
Straight [G]to my [Am]love’s bosom [C]this night I’d [D]draw nigh
And in her little small arms all night I would lay
And think of pretty Saro till the dawning of day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
It’s fair [G]thee well [Am]to old mother and [C]fare thee well to [D]father too
I’m [G]going for [Am]to ramble [C]this wide world [D]all through
And [G]when I [Am]get weary [C]I’ll sit down [D]and cry
And [G]think of [Am]my Saro [C]pretty [D]Saro my bride
{end_of_verse}
