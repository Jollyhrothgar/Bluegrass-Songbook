{start_of_chorus}
Little [D]birdie, little birdie
Come [A]and sing me [D]you song
Got a [D]short time to stay here
And a [A]long time to [D]be gone
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I’m a [D]long way from old Dixie
And my [A]old [D]Kentucky home
Now my parents are both dead and gone
Have [A]no place to call [D]my home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Now I’d rather be a sailor
Way out upon the sea
Then to be at home a marred man
With a baby on my knee
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
For the married man he sees trouble
And the single boy sees none
I expect to live single
Til my days on earth are done
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Now I’d [D]rather be in some dark hollow
Where the [A]sun don’t [D]ever shine
Then to see you love another
When you promised to be mine
{end_of_verse}
