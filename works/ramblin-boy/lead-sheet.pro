{start_of_verse}
He was a pal and a friend always
We rambled round in the hard ol’ days
He never cared if I had no dough
We rambled round in the rain and snow
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
So here’s to you  my ramblin’ boy
May all your rambles bring you joy
So here’s to you  my ramblin’ boy
May all your rambles bring you joy
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
In Tulsa town we chanced to stray
We thought we’d try to work one day
The boss says he had room for one
Says my old pal We’d rather bum
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Late one night in a jungle camp
The weather was cold and it was damp
He got the chills and he got them bad
They took the only friend I ever had
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
He left me here to ramble on
My ramblin’ pal is dead and gone
If when we die we go somewhere
I’ll bet you a dollar he’s ramblin’ there
{end_of_verse}
