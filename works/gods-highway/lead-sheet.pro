{start_of_verse}
There’s a highway up in heaven and the streets are all pure gold
There’ll be shouting there forever in the home land of the soul
I shall meet with all my loved ones and the saints gone on before
On that highway up in heaven on that peaceful golden shore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Oh I’ll walk down heavens highway some sweet day
And I know I’ll hear my blessed savior say
Welcome to your home in heaven that I have prepared for you
For your cares and worries now on earth are through
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I’ll be singing with the angels in those mansions there on high
Be at home with my dear Savior never more to say goodbye
Then again I’ll see my Mom and Daddy who went on before
Walk through glory shouting singing on God’s highway ever more
{end_of_verse}
