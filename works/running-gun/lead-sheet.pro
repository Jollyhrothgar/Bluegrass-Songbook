{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I rode out of Kansas City going south to [F]Mexico
I was [G7]running dodging danger left the [F]girl that I love [C]so
Far behind lay Kansas City and the past that I had [F]earned
Twenty [G7]notches on my six gun marked the lessons [F]I had [C]learned
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Many [F]times I sold my fast guns for a place to lay my [C]head
Till the [F]nights begin to haunt me by the [C]men that I left [G7]dead
Couldn't stand [C]it any longer with this life that I'd [F]begun
So I [G7]said goodbye to Jeannie and [F]became a running [C]gun
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I rode into Amarillo as the sun sank in the [F]west
My [G7]thoughts in Kansas City and the [F]girl that I loved [C]best
As I smiled and kissed her gently and then turned away to [F]go
Said I'd [G7]send for her to meet me when I'd [F]reached old [C]Mexico
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I had barely [F]left the saddle and my foot just touched the [C]ground
When a [F]cold voice from the shadows told me [C]not to turn [G7]around
Said he knew [C]about my fast gun knew the price paid by the [F]law
[G7]Challenged by a bounty hunter so I [F]turned around to [C]draw
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I knew some day I'd meet him for his hand like lightning [F]flashed
My [G7]own gun stood in leather as his [F]bullet tore its [C]path
As my strength was slowly fading I could see him walk [F]away
And I [G7]knew that where I lie tonight he too [F]must lie [C]someday
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Now the crowd [F]is slowly gathering but my eyes are growing [C]dim
And my [F]thoughts return to Jeannie and the home [C]that we had [G7]planned
Oh please tell [C]her won't you mister that she's still the only [F]one
But a [G7]woman's love is wasted when she [F]loves a running [C]gun
