[C]It's her first night on the town  since she was just [Em]18

She never thought that love could ever end so [Em]soon 
Her [F]mind drifts back in time to a mid-summer [G7]moon

And a [F]woman came to be from the girl [G7]of [C]yesterday

She needs [Em]somebody  to [F]gently pick her [C]up

To a [F]man who would love her  [G7]and never let her [C]down

Well I know the lady that's down on her [Em]love 
Cause I [F]used to hold her  and have that special [G7]touch 
But work [C]took me away  from home late at [Em]nights 
And I [F]wasn't there  when she turned out the [G7]lights 
Then [C]both of us got lonely  and I gave into [Em]lust 
And [F]she just couldn't live  with a man [G7]she couldn't [C]trust 
{end_of_verse}
