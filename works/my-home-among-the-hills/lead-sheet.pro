{start_of_verse}
Got a home in the hills of old Virginia I love still
And it stands near the lonesome pines
And I long to go back to the vine covered shack
Where I left that old mother of mine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I can still see her there in that old rocking chair
In my home among the hills
And I seem to hear her say why did you go away
From your home among the hills
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
The pine trees stand alone near my old Virginia home
And that silver hared mother of mine
I can see her smiling face in that old familiar place
In my home among the hills
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I’m leaving here today I’m going back to stay
In my home among the hills
How happy we will be near the lonesome pine trees
In my home among the hills
{end_of_verse}
