{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Midnight [C]on the highway and the stars are all [C7]aglow
And [C7]it [F]seems I’m [C]always drivin, and [G]I miss my [C]darlin’ so
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Midnight on the highway, big bright moon above
It lights the white lines for me, all the way home to my love
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Can’t [C]you hear the wheels a hummin’ as we roll on through [C7]the night
My [C7]desire [F]is [C]to hold you and I’ll [G]be home [C]before daylight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now [C]the shadows  quickly fadin’ as a town comes into [C7]view
Three [C7]more [F]miles my [C]journey’s over [G]and again I’ll be [C]with you
{end_of_verse}
