{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]She never was [D7]much when it [G]came to pre[G7]tendin'
And [C]I knew that [D7]somethin' was [G]wrong
She [D7]never was one who could [G]hide her e[Em]motions
Or [D7]keep any [A7]secret too [D7]long
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You [G]must have been [D7]out of your [Em]mind even [D7]thinkin'
[C]There was somethin' that [D7]she wouldn't [G]tell
The [C]fact you [D7]believe she could [G]keep this [Em]inside her
Just [C]proves you don't [D7]know her too [G]well [D7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I [G]hope for your [D7]sake she's not [G]somthin' you [G7]borrow
That [C]might have looked [D7]good at the [G]time
It's a [D7]little bit late in the [G]day to [Em]remind you 
You're [D7]layin' it [A7]all on the [D7]line
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
And [G]don't you be[D7]lieve that in [Em]time I'll [D7]forget it
And [C]when she comes [G]cryin' to [D7]me
That's [C]when you [D7]best give your [G]soul to some[Em]body
Cause [C]whatever's [D7]left goes to [G]me [D7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I've [G]already [D7]told her to [G]do what she [G7]wants to
[C]And she seemed a [D7]little con[G]fused
She [D7]knows that I love her so [G]much that I'll [Em]give her
This [D7]chance to be [A7]happy with [D7]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
But the [G]first time you [D7]hurt she's [Em]gonna come [D7]cryin'
And [C]you'd better [D7]be on your [G]knees
Yes [C]that's when you [D7]best give your [G]soul to some[Em]body
Cause [C]whatever's [D7]left goes to [G]me
Yes [C]that's when you [D7]best give your [G]soul to some[Em]body
Cause [C]whatever's [D7]left goes to [G]me
