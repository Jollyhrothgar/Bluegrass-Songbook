{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Tonight I’m only borrowing a [F]heart that isn’t [C]mine
I’m [F]stepping out with [C]someone else’s [G7]dream
Though [C]you pretend you care for me [F]you’re only being [C]kind
And [F]all the while I [C]know I’m [G7]borrow[C]ing
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
It’s [G7]sweet of you to understand and [C]play a lover’s part
And [D7]even though I hold your hand I’ll [G7]never hold your heart
The [C]words I whisper in your ear to [F]you don’t mean a [C]thing
Be[F]cause tonight I’m [C]only [G7]borrow[C]ing 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Your heart is filled with sympathy [F]you’re trying to be [C]fair
You [F]know I walk life’s [C]pathway all a[G7]lone
It [C]seems you’re even searching for a [F]love that isn’t [C]there
To [F]help me live a [C]dream I’ve [G7]never [C]known
