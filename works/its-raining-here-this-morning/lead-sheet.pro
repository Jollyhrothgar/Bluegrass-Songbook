{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Oh [F]it’s raining, raining, raining here this morning
As I sit in jail and hang my head in [C]shame
With [C]a [F]smile I try to greet each early dawning
But [F]they’ve given me [C]a number for my name
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Many [F]a little raindrops are falling close to me
Makes [F]the streams and rivers just [C]as muddy as can be
It’s [F]raining, raining, raining here this morning
As [F]the [C]Mississippi flows on to the sea
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
How [F]I wish that I could see my little darling
And [F]hold her in my arms just [C]as before
I [F]used to tell her every day I loved her
But [F]now she [C]doesn’t love me anymore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
She [F]knew that I was guiltless of this one crime
And [F]said that she’d be waiting there [C]for me
But [F]she has found somewhere else to wander
Where [F]the [C]Mississippi flows on to the sea
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Its [F]raining, raining, raining here this morning
And [F]I am just as weary as [C]can be
I [F]wish that I could follow all the raindrops
Down [F]the [C]Mississippi toward the [F]silver sea
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
But [F]there’s no way to prove that I’m not guilty
So [F]I will have to suffer all [C]the shame
Go [C]and [F]tell her for me little raindrops
That [F]they’ve given me [C]a number for [F]my name
{end_of_chorus}
