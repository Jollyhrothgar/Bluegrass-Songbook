[C]I only meant to love you don't you [Dm]know it babe
Why [F]couldn't you be con[G7]tented with the [C]love I gave

Your [F]love scares me to [G7]death girl it's the [C]choking kind

You can kill a man with bullets poison [Dm]or a knife
But it [F]hurts him more to [G7]take his pride and [C]ruin his life
Whatever it is you want girl I [Dm]hope you find
But [F]that hat don't [G7]fit my head it's the [C]choking kind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
When you fall in love again girl take a [Dm]tip from me
If [F]you don't like the [G7]peaches walk on [C]by the tree
Find what you want and keep it treat it [Dm]sweet and kind
But [F]let it breathe don't [G7]make your love the [C]choking kind
{end_of_verse}
