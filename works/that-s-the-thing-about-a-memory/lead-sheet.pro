{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Well I woke up this morning [G7]   and I was feeling [C]fine
But with my first cup of coffee came the last thing on my [G7]mind
It hung around un[C]invited  [F]  the whole day [C]through
[F]It didn't care that I'd been [C]trying [G7]   to keep from missing [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
That's the thing about a [F]memory it's got a mind of its [C]own
It can take an [D7]old flame and chill you to the [G7]bone
Just when you think it's [F]long gone it'll roll back [C]around
[F]But that's the thing about a [C]memory 
When it comes to [D7]misery it'll [G7]never let you [C]down
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I already know that it's not welcome it's [G7]just a fair weather [C]friend
Who wants to be reminded of things that might've [G7]been
It don't matter if I'm [C]driving [F]  or walking down the [C]street
[F]It's never far [C]behind it does it every [G7]time it knocks me off my [C]feet
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
That's the thing about a [F]memory it's got a mind of its [C]own
It can take an [D7]old flame and chill you to the [G7]bone
Just when you think it's [F]long gone it'll roll back [C]around
[F]But that's the thing about a [C]memory 
When it comes to [D7]misery it'll [G7]never let you [C]down
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[F]Yeah that's the thing about a [C]memory
When it comes to [D7]misery it'll [G7]never let you [C]down
{end_of_verse}
