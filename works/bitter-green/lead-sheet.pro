{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
On the bitter green she walked the hills above the town
Echo [D]to her [A]footsteps as soft as ider down
Waiting [D]for her master [A]to kiss away the tears
Waitin’ [G]through [A]the years
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Bitter [D]Green they called her walkin’ in the sun
Lovin’ [G]everyone [A]that [D]she me
Bitter [D]Green they called her waitin’ in the sun
Waitin’ [G]for [A]someone to take [D]her home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Some [D]say he was a [A]sailor who died away at sea
Some [D]say he was a prison’r [A]who never was set free
Lost [D]upon the ocean [A]he died there in the mist
Dreamin’ [G]of [A]a kiss
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
But [D]now that bitter green is gone the hills [A]have turned to rust
There [D]comes a weary stranger [A]his tears fall in the dust
Knealin’ [D]by the [A]churchyard in the autumn mist
Deamin’ [G]of [A]a kiss
{end_of_verse}
