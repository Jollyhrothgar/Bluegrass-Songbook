{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Twilight is stealing over the [D]sea
Shadows are falling dark on the [G]lee
Born on the night winds voices of [D]yore
Come from that far off [G]shore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Far away beyond the starlit [D]skies
Where the lovelight never never [G]dies
Gleameth a mansion filled with [D]delight
Sweet happy home so [G]bright
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Voices of loved ones songs of the [D]past
Still linger round me while life shall [G]last
Lonely I wander sadly I [D]roam
Seeking a far off [G]home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Come in the twilight come come to [D]me
Bringing some message from over the [G]sea
Cheering my pathway while here I [D]roam
Seeking that far off [G]home
{end_of_verse}
