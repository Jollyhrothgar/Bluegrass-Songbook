{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the [D7]waters
Put your [Am]hand in the hand of the [D7]man who calmed the [G]sea
Take a look at yourself and you can [G7]look at the others [C]differently
By putting your [G]hand in the [E7]hand of the [A7]man from [G][D7]Gal-ilee
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Every time I look into the Holy Book I wanna [D7]tremble
When I [Am]read about the part where a [D7]carpenter cleared the [G]temple
For the buyers and the sellers were no different               [G7]C      Fellers than what I profess to be
And it [G]causes me shame to [E7]know I'm not the [A7]gal that [D7]I should [G]be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Mama taught me how to pray before I reached the age of [D7]seven
And when I'm [Am]down on my knees that's when [D7]I'm close to [G]heaven
Daddy lived his life for eight kids and [G7]wife you do what you must [C]do
But he [G]showed me [E7]enough of what it takes [A7]to get [D7]you [G]through

[G]Put your hand in the hand of the man who stilled the [D7]waters
Put your [Am]hand in the hand of the [D7]man who calmed the [G]sea
