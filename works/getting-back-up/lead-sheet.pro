Her [G]love is gone and who knows where it [C]went
And every [G]day is one more [C]day

The hardest [C]thing you'll ever do but it's not [D7]true

It may be the [C]fal[D7]l that brings you to [G]your knees
Yeah the [C]losing it [D7]all leaves you [G]weak
Yeah your [C]heart drops and your [D7]world stops 
When you're [G]falling [D7]out of [Em]love

It's the getting back [G]up [C]

Every minute's [G]one more minute [C]I just made it [Am]through 
[G]That's the best I can [D7]do
