{start_of_verse}
The last time I thought about leaving
Was the last time I made her cry
I’ve talked myself out of believing
That true true love never dies
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
The first time I though of returning
Was just ten lonesome miles out of town
But my foolish pride kept these wheels a-turning
There’s nothing on this earth gonna shut me down.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
If I had one drop of water
For each and every tear I have cried
I’d sail back to her on an ocean of sorrow
True true love never dies.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
The fires in vain turn to ashes
Your pride will forsake you by and by
The lonesomest night surely passes
That old true true love never dies.
{end_of_verse}
