{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]In days gone by [C]but not forgotten
I [D7]plowed in the fields and I [G]pulled in the cotton
[C]Things you'd never think I've done when you see me [D7]now
[G]I pick and sing and they [C]think I'm a star
But [D7]every time I look down at [G]my old guitar
I know I'm [C]just six strings [D7]away from that same ol' [G]plow
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I drive a [C]new Royce Rolls buy them tailor made clothes
[G]How long will good times stay
[G7]A poor boy ways and [C]hard time days
[D7]Just six strings [G]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I met a girl bout a [C]year ago
In a [D7]little country town where I [G]played a show
And though I [C]love her I still wonder just what she'd [D7]do
[G]If I laid that old [C]guitar down 
[D7]How long would she [G]hang around
Or is she [C]just six strings [D7]away from someone [G]new
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Well them [C]six little strings buy rings and new things
But [G]how long would she stay
If she knew poor boy ways and [C]hard time days
[D7]Just six strings [G]away
{end_of_verse}
