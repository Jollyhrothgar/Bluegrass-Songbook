{start_of_chorus}
Roll [G]in my sweet [D]baby’s arms
Roll [G]in my sweet [D]baby’s arms
Lay around the shack ’til the mail comes back
And [G]I’ll roll in my [D]sweet [G]baby’s arms
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I [G]ain’t gonna work on the railroad
I [G]ain’t gonna work on [D]the farm
Lay [G]down the [C]shack ’til the mail train comes back
And [G]I’ll roll in my [D]sweet [G]baby’s arms
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Now [G]where were you last Friday night
While [G]I was lying [D]in jail
Walking [G]the streets with [C]another man
Wouldn’t [G]even [D]go [G]my bail
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I know you parents don’t like me
They drove me away from your door
If I had my life to live over
I’d never go there any more
{end_of_verse}
