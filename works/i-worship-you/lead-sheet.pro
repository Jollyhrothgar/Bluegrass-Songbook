{start_of_verse}
I worship you and the things you do
Still you’re not satisified
I paid the cost I’ve loved and lost
But still I worship you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
When we first met and loved we were always side by side
Never then did I think you’d go wrong
But you started goin’ round with the wrong kind of crowd
To my sorrow I’ve found you’ve gone wrong
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I go back to our home and I lie awake ’til dawn
Still I can’t get you out of my life
And my friends say next day what a price you must pay
Last night I saw someone with your wife
{end_of_verse}
