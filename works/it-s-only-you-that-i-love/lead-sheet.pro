I [D7]love you I love only [G]you

You're as [C]sweet as the dew on the [G]roses

It's [D7]you only you that I [G]love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}

Again when the moon was [G]new

For [D7]heaven was lonely for [G]you

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}

Each night when the moon is [G]new
And I [C]cry as the breeze whispers through the [G]trees
I [D7]love you I love only [G]you
