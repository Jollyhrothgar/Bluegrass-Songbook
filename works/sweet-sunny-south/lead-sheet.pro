{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Take me [G]back to the place where I first saw [D]the [D]light[Dsus4]
To [G]that sweet [G7]sunny south [C]take me home
Where [C7]the [G]mockingbird [C]sings [G]me to sleep [D]every [Dsus4]night[D]
Oh [G]why was [D]I tempted [G]to roam
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I think with regret of the dear home I left
Of the warm hearts that sheltered me there
Of wife and of children of whom I’m bereft
Of the old place again do I sigh
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Take me [G]back to the place where the orange trees [D]grow[D][Dsus4]
To [G]my plot in [G7]the evergreen [C]shade
Where [C7]the [G]flowers from [C]the river’s [G]green [D]margins did [Dsus4]grow[D]
And [G]spread their sweet [D]scent through [G]the glade
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Take me back let me see what is left that I know
Could it be that the old house is gone
Dear friends from my childhood indeed must be few
And I must face death all alone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
The [G]path to our cottage they say has [D]grown [D]green[Dsus4]
And [G]the place is quite [G7]lonely [C]around
I [C7]know [G]that the [C]smiles and [G]the forms I [D]once [Dsus4]knew[D]
Now [G]lie ‘neath [D]the cold [G]mossy ground
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
But yet I return to the place of my birth
Where the children have played ‘round the door
Where they gathered wild blossoms that grew ‘round the path
Twill echo their footsteps no more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Take [G]me back to the place where my little ones [D]sleep[D][Dsus4]
Where poor massa lies buried close by
O’er the graves of my loved ones I long for to weep
and rest there among them when I die
{end_of_verse}
