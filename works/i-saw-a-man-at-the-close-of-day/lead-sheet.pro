{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I [G]saw a man at [G]the close of day
standing [C]by a [D7]grocery door
His [C]eyes were sunken [G]his lips were parched
And [D7]I viewed him o’er [G]and o’er
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
His [G]little son stood by his side
And [C]unto him [D7]he said
Oh [C]father mother [G]is sick at home
And [D7]sister cries [G]for bread
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
He [G]turned around went in at the door
He [C]staggered up to [D7]the bar
And [C]faltering on to the [G]landlord sayin’
Just [D7]give me one [G]dram more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
A [G]year or so I passed thereby
And a [C]crowd stood round [D7]the door
When [C]I asked the [G]reason one replied
The [D7]drunkard is [G]no more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Just [G]then a hearse moved slowly by
No [C]wife nor [D7]children near
They [C]had gone before [G]this foul murder
And [D7]left this world [G]of care
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Come [G]all you jolly dram drinkers
By [C]this a [D7]warning take
And [C]quit the [G]overflowing bowl
Before [D7]it is [G]too late
{end_of_verse}
