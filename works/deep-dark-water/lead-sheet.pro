{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Alone and so lonesome bored and so [C]blue
I got the urge to [G]ramble so I [A7]took a drink or [D7]two
It [G]tempted me to [B7]trifle then my true [C]heart went [G]astray
So I [C]wandered in dark [G]water and just [D7]threw my life [G]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [D7]know that it was wrong to fool around this way so [G]long
Someone [A7]was sawing on the limb that I was sitting [D7]on
I looked [G]down and I [B7]found I could [C]drown in deep dark [G]water
So I [C]cried when I realized [G]I [D7]couldn't [G]swim
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
A fool and his money calls for whiskey and for [C]gin
Filled to the gills and [G]falling for the [A7]weaknesses as a [D7]man
From [G]one fool to [B7]another [C]wrong is never [G]right
I [C]ignored advice from [G]mother and brother look [D7]at me [G]tonight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[D7]Unsteady as I go with deep dark water down [G]below
They keep sawing [A7]louder on my limb and soon I'll have to [D7]go
Life's been [G]small hear my [B7]call as I fall [C]in deep dark [G]water
Don't be a [C]would-be king and [G]tumble from [D7]your [G]throne
{end_of_verse}
