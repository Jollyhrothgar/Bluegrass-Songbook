{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I was [F]raised but a rambling boy
Too [F]many a city I did enjoy
And [F]there I married me a pretty little wife
And [F]I loved her [C]dearer than I love [F]my life
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
She was [F]pretty both neat and gay
She [F]caused me rob the road highway
I [F]robbed it yes I do declare
I [F]made [C]myself ten [F]thousand there
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Plenty dry [F]goods for to carry me through
My [F]pistol swore like money too
My [F]forty four she never failed
My [F]true love [C]come for to go [F]my bale
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
My mother [F]said she has no home
My [F]sister said she’s all alone
My [F]wife she’s left with sad despair
With [F]a broken [C]heart and a [F]baby there
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Now when I [F]die don’t bury me at all
Just [F]place me away in alcohol
My [F]forty four lay by my feet
Please [F]tell [C]them I am [F]just asleep
{end_of_verse}
