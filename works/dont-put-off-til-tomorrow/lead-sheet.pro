{start_of_verse}
You have no doubt in your mind
there’s a heaven up above
And you mean to change before the end
But you hold onto treasures
you possessed here on earth
Feasting your soul on sin
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Don’t put off ’til tomorrow what you can do today
For tomorrow may be too late
Sinner give your heart to Jesus won’t you kneel down and pray
For tomorrow may be too late
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
You say you’ll change tomorrow
but tomorrow never comes
These words you keep repeating everyday
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
How sad will be the story
when you’re laid in your grave
In torment forever you will pay
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
There’s a wreck on the highway
there’s blood on the road
That lifeless body lies cold
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
They’ll never know Jesus
they’ve waited too long
They’ll never live in that heavenly fold
{end_of_verse}
