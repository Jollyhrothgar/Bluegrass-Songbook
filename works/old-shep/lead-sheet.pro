{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]When I was a lad [A7]and old Shep was a [D7]pup
O'er [G7]hills and meadows we'd [C]strayed
Just a boy and his dog we [A7]were both full of [D7]fun
We [G7]grew up together that [C]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [F]remember the time at the old swimming [C]hole
When I would have [D7]drowned beyond [G7]doubt
[C]Shep was right there [A7]to the rescue he [D7]came
He [G7]jumped in and helped pull me [C]out
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
So the years sped along and [A7]at last he grew [D7]old
His [G7]eye sight was fast growing [C]dim
Then one day the doctor [A7]looked at me and [D7]said
I [G7]can't do no more for him [C]Jim
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
With a hand [F]that was trembling I picked up my [C]gun
I aimed it at [D7]Shep’s faithful [G7]head
I [C]just couldn't do it [A7]I wanted to [D7]run
And I [G7]wished they'd shoot me [C]instead
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I went to his side and [A7]I sat on the [D7]ground
He [G7]laid his head on my [C]knees
I stroke the best pal that [A7]a man ever [D7]found
I [G7]cried so I scarcely could [C]see
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Old [F]Sheppie he knew he was going to [C]go
For he reached out and [D7]nipped at my [G7]hand
He [C]looked up at me just [A7]as much as to [D7]say
We're [G7]parting but you'll [C]understand
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Now [C]old Shep is [A7]gone where the [G7]good doggies [C]go
And no [Am]more with old [D7]Shep will I [G7]roam
But if dogs [C]have a heaven [A7]there's one thing I [D7]know
Old [G7]Shep has a wonderful [C]home
{end_of_verse}
