{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
You [Bb]can hang around and love me
You can hang your head and cry
Hang my picture on the [F]wall but it won’t fall
Kiss me when your dreamin no good that will do
It’s goodbye and so long [Bb]to you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You [Bb]can send me pretty flowers
You can send me valentines
Send me letters every [F]day but it won’t pay
Bend to my desires nothing else will do
It’s goodbye and so long [Bb]to you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
You [Bb]can give me your affection
You can give me all your love
Give me all the things [F]I crave but I’ll be brave
All the things you offer make me sad and blue
It’s goodbye and so long [Bb]to you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
You [Bb]can call me your own darling
You can call me what you may
Call me on the [F]telephone I won’t be home
Keep your old love letters I’m all through with you
It’s goodbye and so long [Bb]to you
{end_of_verse}
