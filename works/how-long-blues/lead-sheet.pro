{start_of_verse}
Long ol’ train cruel engineer
They took my baby and left me here
And how long will I keep these lonesome blues
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
How long how long
Has that evening train been gone
How long how long baby how long
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Mean ol’ blues come down on me
They’re all around me they’re all I see
But how long will I keep these lonesome blues
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Cruel engineer can’t you see
I need my baby back with me
Then I’d be rid of these mean ol’ lonesome blues
{end_of_verse}
