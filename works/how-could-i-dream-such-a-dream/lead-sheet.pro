{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I dreamed you were lying close beside me
And I dreamed no one [D7]else had your [G]heart
In this dream you said you loved me
And told me that [D7]we'd never [G]part
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh how could I [C]dream such a [G]dream
How peaceful there while I sleep
But I awoke how strange it did seem
I was lost in a [D7]world so [G]deep
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
You'll never know just how much I love you
And that you're in my [D7]prayers every [G]night
But tonight you're in the arms of another
And I know what I'm [D7]feeling ain't [G]right
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Oh how could I [C]dream such a [G]dream
How peaceful there while I sleep
But I awoke how strange it did seem
I was lost in a [D7]world so [G]deep
