{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Met [Eb]the girl I love in a town way down in Dixie
‘Neath the stars above she was the sweetest girl I ever did see
So I took her in my arms [Bb]and told her of her many charms
I [Eb]kissed her while the fiddles played the Bonaparte’s Retreat
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
All [Eb]the world was bright as I held her on that night
And I heard her say Please don’t ever go away
So I held her in my arms [Bb]and told her of her many charms
I [Eb]kissed her while the fiddles played the Bonaparte’s Retreat
{end_of_chorus}
