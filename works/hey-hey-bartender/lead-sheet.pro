{start_of_verse}
Hey hey hey bartender
come and set me up another round
Hey hey hey bartender
got a lot of troubles I must drown
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Well I guess you guess it’s love
it’s love it’s love it’s love it’s love bartender
Yes I guess you guess this love has got me down
I tried I tried bartender Lordy Lordy Lordy how I tried
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
She Lied she lied bartender
Lordy how that woman went and lied
Well I guess it’s best somehow but now I’m alone
I’m alone I’m alone bartender and I see you see it hurts to be alone
{end_of_verse}
