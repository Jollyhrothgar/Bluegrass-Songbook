{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]There's a place I long to be 
Just a [Am]mile above the [C]sea
Where we [D7]dance to the Colorado [G]Waltz
You can hear the fiddles play
And the [Am]pine trees softly [C]sway
As we [D7]dance to the Colorado [C]Waltz
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
You can [C]dance to the Waltz of [G]Kentucky
Or the beautiful Waltz of Tenne[D7]ssee
But your [G]hearts will be light 
While you're [Am]dancing to[C]night
To the [D7]strings of the Colorado [G]Waltz
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Where the mountains touch the sky
And the [Am]lazy clouds roll [C]by
As we [D7]dance to the Colorado [G]Waltz
Then you'll never want to roam 
From your [Am]Colorado [C]home
Or the [D7]memories of the Colorado [G]Waltz
{end_of_verse}
