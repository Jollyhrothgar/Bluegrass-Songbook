{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]It's a long rocky road that has no turning
[G7]When the one you love proves untrue
[C]You just sit home alone [F]by your [C]telephone
[G7]Crying your heart out for someone who's [C]untrue
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
It's a long rocky road that has no turning
[G7]Teardrops on my pillow tell me so
[C]There's no use in me saying I [F]haven't been [C]praying
[G7]For something I treasure and know I cannot [C]hold
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]Be faithful little darling that's what I use to [C]say
[F]But you paid no attention [D7]you just went on your [G7]way
[C]Oh it's a long rocky road that has no turning
[G7]This yearning dear I hold for you
[C]There's no use of me sighing [F]no use of me [C]crying
[G7]I'll travel alone for I'm lost without [C]you
{end_of_verse}
