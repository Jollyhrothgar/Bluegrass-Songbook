{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
At [G]the end of [C]a long [G]lonely day without you
My [D]world seems to fall on [G]it’s face
Well, [G]I’m alright through the day [C]but the day [G]fades away
At [D]the end of a long [G]lonely day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Another [D]day wishing [C]you [G]were here
I [D]dread each lonely night Lord their [C]filled with tears
Oh how I’ve cried yes I’ve cried and these tears I can’t hide
At [D]the end of a long [G]lonely day
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
At [G]the end of [C]the day [G]I go back to my room
And [D]watch as the sun [G]fades away
And the [C]loneliness there with [G]its grief and despair
At [D]the end of a long [G]lonely day
{end_of_verse}
