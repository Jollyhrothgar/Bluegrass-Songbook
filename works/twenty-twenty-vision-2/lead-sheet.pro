{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I’ve [C]been to the doctor, he says I’m alright
I [F]know he is lying, I’m losing [C]my sight
He [F]should have examined the eyes of [C]my mind
Twenty-twenty [C]vision [G]and walking [C]round blind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Ever since she’s gone and left me I feel so alone
I carry a heart that is heavy as stone
I knew that she cheated, I knew all the time
Twenty [C]twenty [G]vision and walking [C]round blind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
You [C]just couldn’t know her the way that I do
You [F]tell me she’s wicked and maybe [C]it’s true
But one [F]thing I do know she’s no [C]longer mine
Twenty-twenty [C]vision [G]and walking [C]round blind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I’ve [C]lost her I’ve lost her oh what shall I do
I’ll [F]bet you’re not happy as she’s there [C]with you
The [F]eyes of your heart will have trouble [C]like mine
Twenty [C]twenty [G]vision and walking [C]round blind
{end_of_verse}
