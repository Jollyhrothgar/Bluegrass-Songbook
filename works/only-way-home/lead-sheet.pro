{start_of_verse}
I’ve been driftin’ I’ve been stealin’
I’ve been lonesome I’ve been talkin’
To myself and I ain’t got much to say
I’m tired of stories and I’ve heard them anyway
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
All those people slippin’ by me
Got a place that they call home
I’ve got nothing but my longin’
And these hands to call my own
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
How far am I from where I began yesterday ?
How much father do I have to roam ?
I guess I’m weary of travelin’
And drinking my pay but I’m scared of the only way home
{end_of_verse}
