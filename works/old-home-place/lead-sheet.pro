{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[A]It's been ten long [C#7]years since I [D]left my [A]home
In the hollow where I was [E7]born
Where the [A]cool fall [C#7]nights make the [D]wood smoke [A]rise
And the fox hunter [E7]blows his [A]horn
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I fell in [C#7]love with a [D]girl from the [A]town
I thought that she would be [E7]true
[A]I ran [C#7]away to [A][D]Charlottesville
And worked in a [E7]sawmill [A]too
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
[E7]What have they done to the old home [A]place
[B7]Why did they tear it [E7]down
And [A]why did I [C#7]leave my plow [D]in the [A]field
And look for a [E7]job in the [A]town
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well the girl ran [C#7]off with [D]somebody [A]else
The tariffs took all my [E7]pay
[A]And here I [C#7]stand where the old [D]home [A]stood
Before they [E7]took it [A]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Now the geese fly [C#7]south and the cold [D]wind [A]moans
As I stand her and hang my [E7]head
[A]I've lost my [C#7]love I've [D]lost my [A]home
And now I [E7]wish that I was [A]dead 
{end_of_verse}
