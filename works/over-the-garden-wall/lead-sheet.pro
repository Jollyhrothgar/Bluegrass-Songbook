{start_of_verse}
My love stood under a walnut tree
Over the garden wall
She whispered and said she’d be true to me
Over the garden wall
She had beautiful eyes and beautiful hair
She wasn’t very tall so she stood on a chair
Many is the time I kissed her there
Over the garden wall
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Over the garden wall
The sweetest girl of all
There never was yet such eyes of jet
And you can bet I’ll never forget
The night our lips in kisses met
Over the garden wall
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
There’s always a will there’s always a way
Over the garden wall
There’s always a night as well as a day
Over the garden wall
We hadn’t much money, but weddings were cheap
So while the old feller was snoring asleep
With her lad and her ladder she managed to creep
Over the garden wall
{end_of_verse}
