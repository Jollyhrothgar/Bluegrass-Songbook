{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[D7]I just can't [G]understand how you could [C]hurt me so
Then turn and [D7]walk away pretending [C]you don't [G]know
Each time I see you out [G7]with someone [C]new
I go [D7]out of my mind over [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I go [C]out of my mind when you're [G]out of my heart
I can't [D7]help lovin' you like I [G]do [G7]
My heart [C]breaks up inside with each [G]tear that I cry
And I'm [D7]out of my mind over [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[D7]Each day I [G]think of all the things we [C]used to do
And all the [D7]plans we made [C]that won't be [G]comin' true
It seems that all my dreams [G7]are fallin' [C]through
And I'm [D7]out of my mind over [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I go [C]out of my mind when you're [G]out of my heart
I can't [D7]help lovin' you like I [G]do [G7]
My heart [C]breaks up inside with each [G]tear that I cry
And I'm [D7]out of my mind over [G]you
{end_of_verse}
