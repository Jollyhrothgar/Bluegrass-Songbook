{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
There [C]was a girl I loved [F]so dearly
She lived [G7]away back in [C]the hills
When the bluebird sings I miss my [F]darling
She loved me I [G7]know she [C]always will
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
There’s a bluebird singing (bluebird singing)
In the Blue Ridge Mountains [F](Blue Ridge Mountains)
Calling [G7]me back to [C]my home
Oh I can hear (I can hear)
Those bluebirds [F]calling
Calling [G7]me back to [C]my home
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
When [C]I reached my home I was oh so [F]lonely
The one I [G7]loved had [C]gone away
That sad news came from her [F]mother
She’s sleeping [G7]there beneath [C]the clay
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now [C]tonight I’m far from [F]the Blue Ridge Mountains
Far from my [G7]home back in [C]the hills
I’m going back to the Blue Ridge [F]Mountains
These [G7]memories they [C]haunt me still
