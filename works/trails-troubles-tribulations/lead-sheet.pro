{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Trials [G]troubles tribulations
Such [Em]as never been before
When [G]the angels pour upon us
Their [Em]vows of dread for ever [G]more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
When [D7]the fire comes down [G]from Heaven
And [Em]the blood shall fill the sea
I’ll [G]be carried home by Jesus
There [Em]forever with [G]him be
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The [G]beasts with horns will come upon you
One [Em]with seven one with ten
They [G]will cry unto the mountain
They’ll [Em]pray to die but [G]cannot win
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The [G]mark must be upon your forehead
These [Em]earthly goods you then can buy
Depart [G]from me I never knew you
You’ll [Em]hear my blessed [G]Savior cry
{end_of_verse}
