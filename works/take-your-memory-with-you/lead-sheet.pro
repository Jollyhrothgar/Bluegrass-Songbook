{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G7]I can read the writing on the [C]wall 
[G7]You pretend that nothing’s changed at [C]all
I've got just one thing to ask you if it's [D7]so
[F]Take your memory [G7]with you when you [C]go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]So I won't have to [G7]think about
[F]The lonely nights I'll [G7]be without
[F]Someone to hold me [G7]when the cold wind [C]blows
[F]Take your memory [G7]with you when you [C]go
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[G7]Walk the floor and wonder what went [C]wrong
[G7]Have to find a way to carry [C]on
Won't you leave before the heartache starts to [D7]show
[F]And take your memory [G7]with you when you [C]go
