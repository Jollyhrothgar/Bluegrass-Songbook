{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C](When all the beer and [G7]all my friends are [C]gone)
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
It sure was fun [G7]having all the [F]gang around [C]tonight
Laughin' and singin' and [G7]talkin' about old [C]times
We raised our glasses [G7]high and drank and [F]ended up half [C]tight
And not once did you [G7]even cross my [C]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now all the beer and [F]all my friends are [C]gone
And I'm lying in the darkness tryin' to [G7]go to sleep [C]alone
Wonderin' why the [G7]radio [F]plays the saddest [C]songs
When all the beer and [G7]all my friends are [C]gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
It's not too hard to [G7]tell my friends [F]that I don't love you [C]anymore
I lie and say I've [G7]found somebody [C]else
I drink a beer and [G7]say that I don't [F]miss you like [C]before
But now I wonder [G7]what to tell [C]myself
{end_of_verse}
