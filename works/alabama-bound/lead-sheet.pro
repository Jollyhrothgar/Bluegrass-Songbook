{start_of_verse}
Well the preacher got drunk
He throwed his bible down
He told the congregation
I’m Alabama bound
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
I’m Alabama bound
I’m Alabama bound
If the train don’t run
I’ve got a mule to ride
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
Well I’ve been in New York City
And I’ve been in New York town
Good lord but I’ve been in the mountains
With the blues all around
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I jumped in the river
And I started to drown
I spotted a red-headed woman
Good lord I couldn’t go down
{end_of_verse}
