{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
On [Am]one cold and rainy night I [C]was sitting in the light
Of my [Am]switchman’s [G]shack on my post on [Am]the mountain
The [Am]storm was pretty bad and [C]the telegraph was dead
And it was [Am]just eleven [G]hours ’til the [Am]dawning.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Then [C]much to my surprise the [G]telegraph jumped back to life
As I [Dm]read the code I thought could this [Am]be true
A [Am]train was on it’s way [C]headed up the mountain grade
But she [Am]didn’t have [G]a captain [Am]or a crew.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
At [Am]the other switch they tried to put [C]her on the mountainside
But she [Am]kept on [G]coming up the [Am]mountain grade
I [Am]quickly doused the light to try [C]to see into the night
Maybe [Am]I could spot [G]her headlight in [Am]the rain.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
She was [C]pounding down the road I [G]could hear her whistle blow
And [Dm]I thought lord what a high and [Am]mournful sound
Then [Am]the telegraph beganThere’s [C]a cave-in at the mine
And a [Am]hundred men [G]are buried beneath [Am]the ground
.
But Lord [Am]she’s coming now I see around [C]the bend and straight at me
And [Am]her boiler’s [G]glowing red as coal [Am]in hell
The [Am]headlight’s switching wide [C]searching all the mountainside
But the [Am]only sound [G]she’s making is [Am]the wail
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Then [C]I recognize the train by [G]the number and the name
It’s the [Dm]Miner’s Silver Ghost [Am]Old 41
Then she [Am]vanished up the track by [C]the lonely switchman’s shack
Like [Am]a mother who [G]is looking for [Am]her son
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Now I recall the story of the train that went to glory
Over [Am]fifty years [G]ago on this [Am]same night
She [Am]was stealing for the cave-in there [C]were men that needed saving
But she [Am]missed the curve [G]and trestle near [Am]the mine.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Now [C]every now and then you’ll hear [G]her whistle on the wind
If [Dm]the mountain slides and many men [Am]are lost
It’s [Am]the high and lonely wailing [C]searching up and down the mountain
The [Am]train they call the [G]call the Miner’s [Am]Silver Ghost
{end_of_verse}
