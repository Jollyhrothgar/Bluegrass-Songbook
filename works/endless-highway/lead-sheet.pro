{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Endless [C]highway as far as [G]I can see
The [C]road will take me back to [D]her tonight
It’s been so long since I’ve seen her smile
I’ll be [C]counting all the [D]miles ’til I [G]get home.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
How [D]many [C]hours ’til [G]I hold her?
How [D]many [C]days before [A]we hit the [D]road again?
Endless [G]highway
she don’t [C]know how much [G]I miss her
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Headed [C]down this road [D]and bound for [G]Tennessee.
Lonesome [C]feeling deep [G]inside my heart
Longing [C]for [G]this weary night [D]to end
I’ll think [C]about her try to keep my tired [G]eyes open
Come the [C]morning light I’ll be [D]back home again.
{end_of_verse}
