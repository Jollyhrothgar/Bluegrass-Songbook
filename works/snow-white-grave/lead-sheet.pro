{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
All [G]around the cabin door [C]falls little flakes [G]of snow
I’m [G]searching for the foot prints of the one that I [D]loved [D7]so
The last [G]time I saw my darling [C]the earth was [G]covered white
And [G]little flakes of snow have faded [D]my sweetheart’s path [G]tonight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
From [C]this cabin she did go [G]I watched her foot prints fade
I [G]don’t know why she left me I never dreamed she’d go [D]away[D7]
Little [G]snow flakes fell from Heaven from the [C]Heaven way [G]up above
And [G]paved a way made a snow white grave of the [D]only one [G]I loved
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
She [G]left a memory of tender love and [C]a picture on [G]the wall
My [G]teardrops now are bigger than the snow white flakes [D]that [D7]fall
And each [G]moment I grow weaker [C]sadly gazing at [G]the snow
And I [G]feel that I will fade away with [D]that slow [G]melting snow
{end_of_verse}
