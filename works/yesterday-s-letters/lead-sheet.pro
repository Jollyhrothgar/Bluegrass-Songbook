[C]Fiery kisses linger on two [A7]lips that miss you so
As my [Dm]nervous fingers [G7]sort the pages [C]through[G7]

As [F]yesterday's [G7]letters take me back to [C]you

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[F]Yesterday's [G7]letters [F]with yesterday's [C]glow
[D7]Will tell me that you love me any[G7]time I want to know
[F]Yesterday's [G7]letters [F]so timeless and [C]true
Will [F]always keep me [G7]close to [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
A world that's held together by some [A7]lines of faded blue
[Dm]Is not exactly [G7]what I've had in [C]mind

So [F]yesterday's [G7]letters will be my share of [C]you

Will [F]always keep me [G7]close to [C]you
