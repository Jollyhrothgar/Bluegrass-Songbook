{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
We [D]have been so close [A]together[G]
Each a [A]candle each [D]a flame
All the dangers were [A]outside [G]us
And we [A]knew them all [D]by name
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
See [D]how [A]the [G]bramble and [D]the rose
Intertwine[A]
Love [D]grows [A]like [G]the bramble and [D]the [G]rose
Round [G]each [A]other we [D]will twine
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Now [D]I’ve hurt you and [A]it hurts [G]me
Just to [A]see what we [D]can do
To [D]ourselves and to [A]each [G]other
Without [A]really [D]meaning to
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
So [D]put your arms [A]around [G]me
And we’ll [A]sing a true [D]love song
And we’ll learn to sing [A]together[G]
Sing and [A]laugh the whole [D]night long
{end_of_verse}
