{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
As [G]I went down for to take a little walk
I came upon that [D]Wild [G]Bill Jones
He [G]was a walking and a talking by my true lover’s side
And I bid him to [D]leave [G]her alone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
He [G]said my age is twenty-one
Too [D]old to be [G]controlled
I [G]pulled my revolver from my side
And I destroyed that [D]poor [G]boy’s soul
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
He [G]reeled and he staggered, and he fell to the ground
And then he gave [D]one [G]dying moan
He [G]wrapped his arms around my little girl’s neck
Saying honey won’t [D]you take [G]me home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
So [G]put them handcuffs on me boys
And lead me to that [D]freight [G]car gate
I [G]have no friends or relations there
No-one for to [D]go [G]my bail
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
So [G]pass around that old long necked bottle
And we’ll [D]all go on [G]a spree
For [G]today was the last of that Wild Bill Jones
And tomorrow will be [D]the last [G]of me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
They sent me to prison for twenty long years
This poor boy longs to be free
But Wild Bill Jones and that long-necked bottle
Have been the ruin of me
{end_of_verse}
