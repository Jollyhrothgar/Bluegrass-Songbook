{start_of_verse}
Headin back to the hills and home
This old country never more to roam
This travellin’ life is not for me
I’m heading back to the hills and home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Like many other wanderin lads
I went away my fortune to see
It’s all the same but now I know
My fortune’s here among the hills and home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I can smell the mountain laurels bloomin’
Along the road that leads up to my home
That stand of oak out behind the shed
Makes me long for the hills and home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
There’s a light shining from the window
The smoke is curlin from the chimney top
Mom and dad about their evening chores
I’ll soon be back among the hills and home
{end_of_verse}
