{start_of_verse}
Lonesome blue heartbroken
As here I sit alone
My sweetheart’s gone and left me
Now everything’s gone wrong
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Her hair was dark and curly
And hung way down behind
But now she loves another
I’m run-ning on the vine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I ne-ver rode a boxcar
Until she turned me down
I’ll never love no other
I’ll never settle down
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
On down this lonesome railroad
My back to the old hometown
My past will always haunt me
And the girl who turned me down
{end_of_verse}
