{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I topped the ridge this mornin' looked [F]across the great expanse
I [G7]had to stop and thank the Lord for givin' me the [C]chance
To make my way a horseback in a [F]country most ain't seen
We're the [G7]Pullman county cowboys on our way to Abi[C]lene
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh the coosie ain't too grumpy and the [F]cattle ain't too wild
And the [G7]stories round the wagon even [F]make the trail boss [G7]smile
Now I [C]wouldn't trade my hot roll for a [F]feather bed in town
And on [G7]top of all of this I'm gettin' forty and [C]found
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I tell you boys I'm lucky because [F]punchin' is my trade
In [G7]my corral are memories of all the friends I've [C]made
Like my buddy Curly Jackson and my [F]pal Dakota Slim
If the [G7]boss don't wanna pay me shoot I reckon I'd pay [C]him
{end_of_verse}

And on [G7]top of all of this I'm gettin' forty and [C]found

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
We crossed the South Canadian we're [F]nearly half way there
Soon [G7]we'll get to change our cloths and shave and cut our [C]hair
We'll probably whoop it up a bit and [F]raise a little cane
Then [G7]take our beds and saddles back to Texas on the [C]train
