{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Well momma knows her child is ailing
What is wrong there ain't no telling
She don't know what's run my fever [D7]up
She wants to take me to the clinic
I don't need to see no to panic
All I need is someone sweet to [G]love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]Don't you bring me Doctor Jake
I'm strong enough to swim a lake
[G]All I need is what I'm dreaming [D7]of
She [G]lives just around some corner
Help me out or I'm a goner
[D7]I've gotta find me someone sweet to [G]love
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Yes I work hard to make my money
Like the beehives love their honey
Everything but one fits like a [D7]glove
So don't send me a nice long letter
Asking me if I feel better
All I need is someone sweet to [G]love
{end_of_verse}
