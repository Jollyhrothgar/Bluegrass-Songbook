I'm a [Am]believer [D7]
And much [Am]more than anything[D7]
I believe in [G]you

And if you [Am]told me the ocean went [D7]dry
I'd believe in [G]you [D7]

So [G]call me a hopeless romantic
Cause I can still [D7]belie[G]ve
I can still [D7]belie[G]ve in [Am]true love [D7]

Have you ever noticed while telling a tall tale
The look on the face of a [Am]child
She accepts without question as [D7]though it was gospel
They're [Am]only like [D7]that for a [G]while 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
So call me a hopeless romantic
Cause I can still [D7]belie[G]ve
I can still [D7]belie[G]ve in [Am]true love [D7]
And [Am]hopeless ro[D7]mantic still can [G]fin[D7]d a [Em]way [D7]
To make [C]true [Bm]love [Am]last   
To make tr[C]ue lo[Bm]ve la[Am]st
To make t[C]rue l[Bm]ove l[Am]ast  [D7]these da[G]ys
For a [Am]hopeless ro[D7]mantics like [G]me 
{end_of_verse}
