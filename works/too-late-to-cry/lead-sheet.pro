Come [E]take me by [A]my [E]trembling hand
And [E]hold me close [B7]to you
And [B7]think of all [A]the days [E]gone by
The [E]day [B7]when love [E]was true
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Come [E]go with me to [A]the old [E]depot
And [E]wave your [B7]hand good-bye
I [B7]know I’ve done [A]you wrong [E]sweetheart
But [E]now it’s [B7]too late [E]to cry
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Sweetheart [E]of mine, [A]I hate [E]to go
And [E]leave you here [B7]all alone
May [B7]God [E]protect [A]and keep you
Wherever [E]you [B7]may [E]roam
{end_of_verse}
