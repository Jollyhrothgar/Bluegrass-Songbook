{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Well I sat down at a table [G7]next to a [C]party
And I could see they were having a good [G]time
So I ordered up a bottle of the [G7]same thing they were [C]drinking
But it [D7]didn't do a thing to ease my [G]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Yes it all depends on [C]how you drink the [G]wine
When I [D7]turn to the bottle heart[G]aches is all I find
Some people get happy but [G7]I just keep on [C]crying
Yes it [D7]all depends on how you drink the [G]wine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
When I look in the bottle [G7]I see your re[C]flection
But I turn it up and drink it like a [G]fool
This wine don't kill my feelings so I [G7]might as well be [C]leaving
And [D7]let somebody else have my [G]stool
{end_of_verse}
