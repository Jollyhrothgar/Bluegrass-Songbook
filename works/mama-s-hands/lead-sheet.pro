{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]My daddy's hands held [F]tens and two's [G7]while mom's were holding [C]me
And daddy's hands [F]lost everything to a hand [G7]of kings and [C]threes 
And daddy's hands they [F]shook so bad [G7]that he turned to [C]wine
But mama's hands were [F]strong and calm as [G7]they held on to [C]mine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Yes mama's hands held on [F]to mine to [G7]guide me day and [C]night
And it took the sting of [F]mama's hands to [G7]teach me wrong from [C]right
When times were bad and [F]money's slim she'd [G7]fold her hands in [C]fray
Ands somehow she would [F]make the food [G7]hold out another [C7][C]day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]Now mama's hands are [C]cold with age they [F]tremble as [G7]she [C]prays
But her [F]voice is strong as she [C]thanks God  [D7]for the bygone [G7]days
[C]She looks at me and [F]then she smiles she [G7]knows I [C]understand
That everything I am [F]today I owe [G7]to mama's [C]hands 
Everything I [F]am today I owe [G7]to mama's [C]hands
{end_of_verse}
