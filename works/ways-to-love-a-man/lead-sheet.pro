[G]There are so many [C]ways to love a [G]man 
And [C]so many [D7]things to [G]understand
And [C]if there ever comes a [D7]time 
You [B7]decide to change your [G]mind
I'll need a way to [C]hold you and [G]I [C]can
Cause I'll [G]know all the [C]ways to love a [G]man
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But there's so many [C]ways to lose a [G]man 
So [C]quickly he can [D7]slip through your [G]hands
One [C]little thing goes [D7]wrong 
Then [B7]all at once he's [G]gone
I'd have no way to [C]hold him like [G]I [C]planned
It takes [G]more than just one [C]way to love a [G]man
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
With my hands [C]my heart anything I can [D7]find 
My [B7]child my home my soul and my [C]mind
[G]I'll know that I can [C]hold him yes I [C][G]can 
If I [G]know all the [C]ways to love a [G]man
