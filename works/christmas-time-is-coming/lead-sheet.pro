{start_of_verse}
Snowflakes falling my old home is calling
Tall pines are humming Christmas time is coming.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Can’t you hear them bells ringin’ ringin’  joy to all here them singin’
Let it snow and I’ll be going back to my country home
Christmas times a’ coming  Christmas times a’ coming
Christmas times a’ coming and I know I’m going home.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
Holly’s in the window home where the wind blows
Can’t walk for running Christmas time is coming.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Home fires burning my heart’s yearning
For the folks at home when  Christmas time is coming.
{end_of_verse}
