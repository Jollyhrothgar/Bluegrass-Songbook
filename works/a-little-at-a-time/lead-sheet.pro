{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[F]He doesn't [C]know that everything is [Am]changed
He still says he [C]loves me but now he looks [Em]away
And more than [F]that he says less and less each [Am]day
[C]He's telling me good[F]bye  [G7]a little at a [C]time[F]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I can see it in his [C]eyes I can feel it in his [Am]touch
I hear it in his [C]voice but he don't say [Em]much
In the [F]quiet moments after we make [Am]love 
[C]He's telling me good[F]bye  [G7]a little at a [C]time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G7]If he believes by slowly [F]letting go 
Somehow it [C]doesn't show he's [F]wrong
[G7]No way for him to hide what's [Dm]going on 
[C]I know[F]   [G7]I know
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
He might get [C]away with lying to him[Am]self 
But I know him [C]better than anyone [Em]else
He won't [F]admit it but his heart's already [Am]left
[G7]He's telling me good[F]bye  [G7]a little at a [C]time
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[G7]No way for him to hide what's [Dm]going on 
[C]I know[F]  [G7]I know
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Why do I [C]hesitate why don't I set him [Am]free
Just bring it to an [C]end and just let him [Em]leave
Maybe [F]deep down in my heart the truth could [Am]be
[C]I'm telling him good[F]bye  [G7]a little [C]time[Am]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
Yeah I'm telling him good[F]bye  [G7]a little at a [C]time
{end_of_verse}
