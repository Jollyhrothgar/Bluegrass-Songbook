{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Last [G]night the pale moon [C]was shining

I [G]wandered alone [C]in sadness
Out [G]among [D7]the [G]woodland hills
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [G]heard the birds [C]a-singing
Out [G]among the trees [D7]and views
And [G]every bird, [C]my darling
Was [G]singing, [D7]was singing [G]of you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Was [C]singing, singing of [G]you, my love
Was [G]singing, [D7]was singing [G]of you
And [G]every bird, [C]my darling
Was [G]singing, [D7]was singing [G]of you
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I [G]think of you in [C]the daytime
I [G]dream of you [D7]at night
I [G]wake and wish you [C]were here, love,
And [G]tears [D7]are [G]blinding my sight
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
The [G]flowers that slumber [C]so sweetly
The [G]stars above [D7]the blue
Oh [G]heaven itself, [C]my darling
Is [G]thinking, [D7]is [G]thinking of you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I [G]open my window [C]so gently
And [G]look on the [D7]dreamy view
The [G]world itself, my [C]darling
Is [G]sighing, [D7]is sighing [G]for you
{end_of_verse}
