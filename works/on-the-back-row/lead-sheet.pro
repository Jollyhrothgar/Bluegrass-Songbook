{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Here I sit on the [F]back row in a [C]church down the street
Not to far from the [F]place where we used to [C]meet
And to find me getting [C7]though to me you [F]found someone to love
But [G7]I'll go back to the place that I keep thinking [C]of
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
It's not a [F]fancy place just a tavern in the [C]lonely part of town
Where [G7]lonely people find someone that [C]hopes to settle down
They tell [F]me to go and I can't under[C]stand
Here [G7]I sit on the back row  while you wed another [C]man
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
You'd never dream but [F]after many years I [C]may still be sitting there
With just a bottle and [F]two glasses right [C]next to your favorite chair
All alone you might not [C7]give him and he [F]might even tell you wrong
There [G7]I'll sit in a tavern waiting for you all [C]alone
{end_of_verse}
