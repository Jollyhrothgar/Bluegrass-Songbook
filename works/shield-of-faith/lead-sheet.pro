{start_of_verse}
Sometimes I’m battle weary
I forget to use my shield
The arrows pierce my armor
And I stumble in the field.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
A shield won’t do much good if it’s hanging by your side
Keep the shield of faith before you if you want to stay alive.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
I’ll think my life is over
But the Lord He comes to me
He heals my wounded spirit
And He sets me on my feet.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Sometimes you’re battle weary
But the war’s already won
Keep your head and hold your shield high
‘Til your days in life are done.
{end_of_verse}
