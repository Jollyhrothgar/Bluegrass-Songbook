[C]I loved you more in just a few hours

The sweetest re[Dm]flections [G7]fill the loneliest [C]tears

And I'll spend my life [F]loving a [C]memory

[F]Loving a [C]memory [G7]I never can [C]hold
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Oh what a mark you left on my body
Destroyed my [Dm]heart [G7]and crippled my [C]mind
And if I should live [G7]until I'm one [C]hundred
I'll never [Dm]forget you [G7]there's not enough [C]time
{end_of_verse}
