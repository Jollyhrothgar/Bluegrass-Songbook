{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I came here because I [G7]knew I’d be [C]welcomed 
And because somehow you [F]always under[G7]stand     
[F]You seem to have a way with lonely [C]people 
And you [D7]always were my greatest helping [G7]hand

Now [C]once again I’m [G7]here to take [C]advantage 
And I don’t deserve the [F]arms I left [G7]alone 
[F]I need to know there's someone who still [C]loves me 
And I need a [G7]sho-ul-[F]der to cry [C]on     
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I overlooked the [G7]love you tried so [C]hard to give 
The love I never [F]seemed to under [G7]stand     
[F]I always stayed long enough to [C]hurt you 
And what [D7]little love I gave was second [G7]hand 
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]Now once again I’m [G7]here to take ad[C]vantage 
Cause once again the [F]one I love is [G7]gone

And I need a [G7]sho-ul-[F]der to cry [C]on     
{end_of_verse}
