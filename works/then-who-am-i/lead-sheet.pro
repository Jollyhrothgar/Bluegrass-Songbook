If he's the [C]one that keeps your heart [G]alive 
Who am I  [D7]who am [G]I

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Am I no more than [D7]just a rock you [G]needed for a stepping [C]stone
Until the right one came [G]along
If he's the [C]one that lives with you [G]inside 
Who am I  [D7]who am [G]I

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Am I no more than [D7]just a fool that [G]held you up when you were [C]down
Until your true love could be [G]found

Then who am I  [D7]who am [G]I
Yes who am I  [D7]who am [G]I
