{start_of_verse}
I’ve been a moonshiner for many long years
I spend all of my money on whiskey and beer
I’ll go down to some holler and set up my still
I’ll sell you a gallon for a two dollar bill.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I’ll eat when I’m hungry and I’ll drink when I’m dry
If whiskey don’t kill me Lord I’ll live ’til I die.
God bless them moonshiners they’re all friends of mine
Their breath is a sweet as the dew on the vine.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I’ll go down in some grocery and I’ll drink with my friends
No women to bother me or see what I spend
God bless them pretty women I wish one was mine
For their breath is more sweeter than even moonshine.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
God bless that pretty woman I wish she was mine
For her breath is more sweeter than even moonshine.
