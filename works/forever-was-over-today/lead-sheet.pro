It's [C]hopeless for [D7]me to be[G7]lieve

And that you'll [C]bring your sweet [G7]love home to [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
For[F]ever means nothing to [C]you 
Or the [D7]promises that you've [G7]made
[F]Love stopped as fast as it's [C]started 
For[F]ever was [G7]over to[C]day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[G7]You've [C]only been [G7]gone since this [C]morning at [F]dawn
And I'm [C]already [D7]losing my [G7]mind
Your [C]love tore [G7]apart all the [C]dreams in my [F]heart
And my [C]plans for the [G7]future have [C]died
