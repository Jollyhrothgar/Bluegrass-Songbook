{start_of_chorus}
Listen [D]poor sinner you’re drifting away
From the dear Savior who’s pleading [A]today
What [E]will [D]you do if the Savior [G]was nigh
When the [D]pale horse and [A]his rider [D]go by
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
The [D]time is not long when the Savior will come
Then you’ll be judged by the deeds you have [A]done
On [D]judgment day you’ll weep and [G]you’ll cry
When the [D]pale horse and [A]his rider [D]go by
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Soften your heart and turn from all sin
For Jesus is waiting to welcome you in
There’s coming a time you’ll wish He was nigh
When the [D]pale horse and [A]his rider [D]go by
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Won’t [D]you redeem your poor wicked soul
You can’t pay your way with silver and [A]gold
If [D/A]you’re [D]not saved you’ll be lost in [G]the night
When the [D]pale horse and [A]his rider [D]go by
{end_of_verse}
