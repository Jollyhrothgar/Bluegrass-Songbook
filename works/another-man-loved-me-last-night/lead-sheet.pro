[C]He doesn't know that I can't look him in the [F]eyes

I [C]hope he thinks that I'm just moody and [F]quiet
But [C]another man [G7]loved me last [C]night

Yes [G7]another man loved me last [C]night
[D7]I'd almost forgotten what love was really [G7]like

I let [C]another man [G7]love me last [C]night

While he's sleeping well I'm crying here [F]awake

When [C]another man [G7]loved me last [C]night
