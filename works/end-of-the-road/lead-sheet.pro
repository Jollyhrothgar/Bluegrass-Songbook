{start_of_verse}
Soon I’ll lay my burden down and I’ll wear a starry crown
I’ll be happy at the end of the road
Where there’s never grief or pain everyone will be the same
What a meetin’ at the end of the road
Life is often hard to bear many worries woes and cares
And we often wonder how we bear the load
But there is a better way Jesus went and paved the way
What a meetin’ at the end of the road
Now don’t walk this road of sin, let the savior enter in
Let him lead you to his blessed abode
Where there is no other way and he’ll call you any day
What a meetin’ at the end of the road
Soon I’ll lay my burden down and I’ll wear a starry crown
I’ll be happy at the end of the road
Where there’s never grief or pain everyone will be the same
What a meetin’ at the end of the road
