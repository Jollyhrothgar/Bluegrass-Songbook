S:William Sydney Mount manuscripts
N:Mount annotates his manuscript page with “Stony Brook (Long Island, New York)
N:August 22nd, (18)52” and “As played by P(?).J. Cook.” At the end of the first part is the
N:note “octave 2nd time,” meaning presumably that probably the first eight bars are to be
N:played an octave higher as a variation when the whole tune is repeated, probably with
N:the two bar ending that Mount entered at the top of the page. Interestingly, Mount’s
N:manuscript predates the first known publication of the melody, in Buffalo, N.Y., by
N:Blodgett & Bradford in 1858, although the tune and the story of the traveler and the
N:country fiddler were known to be in circulation some two decades beforehand,
N:stemming probably from plantation sources and then to the minstrel stage.
