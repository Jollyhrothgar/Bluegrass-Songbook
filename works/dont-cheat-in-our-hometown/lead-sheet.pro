{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Tonight [E]my heart is beatin’ low and my head [A]is bowed
You’ve [A]been [B]seen with my best friend on the other side of [E]town
I don’t mind the waitin’ don’t mind the runnin’ around
But [A]if you’re gonna cheat [E]on me [B]don’t cheat in our [E]home [E7]town.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
How [A]can I stand up to my friends [E]and look em’ in [E]the [E7]eye
Admit [A]the questions that I know [E]would be nothin’ [B]but [B7]lies
You [E]spend all your pastime makin’ me [A]a clown
But [A]if you’re gonna cheat [E]on me [B]don’t cheat in our [E]home [E7]town.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Now [E]there [E]are no secrets in this [A]little country town
Every [B]one knows every one for miles and [E]miles around
Your bright [E]eyes and your sweet smile are [A]drivin’ me insane
You [A]think it’s smart to break [E]my [B]heart and run down [E]my [E7]name.
{end_of_verse}
