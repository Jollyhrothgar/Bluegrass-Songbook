{start_of_verse}
Since first we met somehow I knew
It wouldn’t last our whole life through
Now sure enough years later on
I look for you and you are gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Gone but not forgotten
You’re still in my memory
Gone but not forgotten
I’ll stay right here till you come home to me.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus}
One rainy night and a no good fight
When I woke you were outta sight
Now after all that we’ve been through
I thought I’d hear just once from you.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_chorus}
I search for you most every day
More sorry now than words can say
Maybe you don’t live in this world
But you’ll still be my only girl.
{end_of_chorus}
