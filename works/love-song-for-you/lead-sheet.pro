{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I am writing this [E7]song for [A7]you 
Let me [F]see do I [G7]know what to [C]say [G7]
For the [C]old words of [E7]love won't [A7]do 
Let me [F]try to [G7]explain it this [C]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The [E7]meek child inherit the [A7]earth 
And if [D7]I should be one of the [G7]few
[C]All the wealth I will [E7]own won't be [A7]worth
The [F]joy I have [G7]known loving [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
In the night I can [E7]reach for your [A7]hand 
And I [F]know it will [G7]always be [C]there[G7]
How can [C]I make [E7]you under[A7]stand 
What it [F]means just to [G7]know that you [C]care
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I can [E7]think of what my life would [A7]be 
If [D7]I'd'a lived it without knowing [G7]you
Though I [C]don't even [E7]know the [A7]key 
I [F]am writing this [G7]love song for [C]you
{end_of_verse}
