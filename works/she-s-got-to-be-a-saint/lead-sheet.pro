How she cries for [G]me

[C]But I know all the while

Still she forces a [G]smile

Soon it's gonna be dawn and if she finds me gone
Would it be best for [G]her

{start_of_verse: Verse 10}
I see her cry in her sleep so I kiss her wet cheek
[C]I kneel by her and pray
And I'll turn [G]off the light step out in the [D7]night
And I'll go on my [G]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
When I'm down in the dumps and she nurses my lumps
How she cries for [G]me
