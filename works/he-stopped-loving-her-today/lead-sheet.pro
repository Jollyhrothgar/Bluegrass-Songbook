{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]He said I'll love you 'til I die
She told him you'll forget in [Am]time
As the years went slowly [D7]by 
She still preyed upon his [G]mind
{end_of_verse}

He kept her picture on his wall
Went half crazy now and [Am]then 
He still loved her through it [D7]all 
Hoping she'd come back [G]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Kept some letters by his bed
Dated [Am]1962
He had underlined in [D7]red
Every single I love [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I went to see him just today
Oh but I didn't see no [Am]tears
All dressed up to go [D7]away
First time I'd seen him smile in [G]years

(Chorus)

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
[D7]He stopped loving her [G]today
They placed a [G7]wreath upon his [C]door
And soon they'll carry him [D7]away
He stopped loving her [G]today

This time he's over her for good
