{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I looked for [Em]Him in a [E7]soft summer [A7]rain and [D7]He was there
When my world was [A7]dark and it [D7]all seemed in [G7]vain yet [C]He was there
Then I saw Him in the [C7]desert sun and [F]on the ave[Dm]nue
I could [G7]hear Him in a little church when two [C]sweethearts [D7]said I [G7]do
I [C]looked for [Em]Him in the [E7]heart of a [A7]friend [D7]and He was there
Oh I searched for Him when my ways I would [G7]mend and [C]He was there
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
It's so simple yet so [C7]wonderful every[F]body every[C]where
Just look for [Am]Him [D7]and He'll [G7]be [C]there 
{end_of_verse}
