[C]Strolling in the evening when the moon’s hanging low
Just walking talking baby cause I [C7]miss you so
With [F]twilight kisses this evening [C]dew
I miss you [G7]baby in the shadows of the old [C]bayou

My thoughts keep a-haunting the memories of you
Can’t eat sleep don’t know what [C7]I’m to do
My [F]heart keeps a-calling calling for [C]you
I need you [G7]baby in the shadows of the old [C]bayou
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Now when [F]shadows fall on the [C]bayou
And [F]whippoorwills call through the [C]night
The [F]perfume of the sweet [C]magnolia
[D7]When I’m holding you oh so [G7]tight
{end_of_verse}

[C]I’m just a-dreaming and a-scheming just a-planning my dear
Just thinking wishing darling you [C7]were here
For my [F]heart it misses it misses sweet [C]you
I am so [G7]lonesome in the shadows of the old [C]bayou
