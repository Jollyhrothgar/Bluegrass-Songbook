{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]At the end of the day my [D7]heart's filled with [G]despair
I [D7]knelt by my bed for a moment of [G]prayer
I asked God to help me [D7]and show me the [G]way
Then [D7]out of the darkness a voice seemed to [G]say
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Follow me [C]and your sins will be washed snowy [G]white
Follow [C]me to the streets that are [G]paved with pure [D7]gold
Follow me [G]and your darkness [D7]would turn into [G]light
You'll [D7]see riches and treasures [G]untold
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I was lost in a world [D7]filled with doubt and the [G]shame
Each [D7]day brought me tears that I'd fall by the [G]way
Then out of the rocks and [D7]the caverns there [G]came
A [D7]voice that somehow seemed to [G]say
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Follow me [C]and your load will be lighter to [G]bear
Follow [C]me and your heart will be [G]free from all [D7]care
Follow me [G]and I'll make you a [D7]place with Him [G]there 
If [D7]you would just follow [G]me
{end_of_verse}
