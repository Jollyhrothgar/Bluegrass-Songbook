{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Hearts on Fire  [C]burning for each [F]other
Going [C]down in flames somewhere in the [G7]night
Stealing [C]love again when we're [F]together
It's too late [C]now we can't put [G7]out  hearts on [Am]fire
{end_of_verse}

[C]You shouldn't feel this good in my arms  but you [Dm]do
I shouldn't whisper these things in your ear  but their [C]true
So wrong or right  I'll stay [C7]tonight with [F]you
