She [D]sleeps in the grave all covered [G]with snow
{end_of_verse}

Sleeping [C]neath the [G]gentle snow
Sweetly [D]she sleeps while [G]the winter winds blow
Calmly [G]she’s resting neath the mantle of white
Our [D]mother is sleeping she’s sleeping [G]tonight
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
There [G]she will sleep til the springtime has come
Sweet [D]fragrant roses [G]will bloom on her tomb
Sleeping [D]so calm while [G]the winter winds blow
She [D]sleeps in a grave all covered [G]with snow

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
There [G]she will sleep beneath the snow covered mound
Til [D]that glad day when [G]the trumpets shall sound
Then [G]she will wake from her slumber below
And we’ll [D]be reunited to live [G]evermore
