{start_of_verse}
I remember the face of an angel
The love that was faithful and true
I left that dear girl in the mountains
For a ramblin’ life empty and blue
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Sweet roses bloom where they’re layin’
Wild flowers seed on the wind
That valley was closer to heaven
Than any place this poor fool has been
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
It’s a far cry from here to Virginia
But I’d crawl every inch of that ground
My teardrops fall like rain on the roof
For that Blue Ridge home where I’m bound
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
This highway’s a ribbon of lonesome
Don’t care where I lay my head down
For ten years it’s died broken hearted
My sweet mountain darlin’ is gone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I remember the face of an angel
{end_of_verse}
