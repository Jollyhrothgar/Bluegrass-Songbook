{start_of_chorus}
Heart and soul mind and body
We were as close as close can be
Heart and soul mind and body
Now I feel pain in every part of me
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
We found love and whirlwind romance
The feeling was right and the passion strong
Love was a thrill and satisfying
How could we know it would somehow end
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Your feelings changed you found another
Some things about me you can’t accept
I tried to change but I can’t forget her
We grew apart and then love soon left
{end_of_verse}
