{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
There’s a [A]little grave on [D]the green hillside [A]that lies to the [E]morning sun
And the [A]way worn feet [D]often wander there when [E]the cares of the day [A]are done
We [D]sometimes sit in [A]the twilight fall and talk of a far [E]off land
And we [A]sometimes feel in [D]the twilight there [E]the touch of a [A]vanished hand
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Grave on the green hillside [E]grave on the green hillside
In the [A]years to come we [D]will calmly sleep in [A]a grave on [E]the green [A]hillside
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
And this land is full of these [D]little graves in [A]the valleys plains [E]and hills
There’s [A]angel too for each [D]little grave [E]an angel [A]procession fills
I [D]know not how but [A]I sometimes think that they lead us with [E]gentle hand
And a [A]whisper falls on [D]a willing ear from [E]the shore of a far [A]off land
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
And these little graves are but [D]wayside marks [A]that point to a far [E]off land
And they [A]speak to the soul of [D]a better day of [E]a day that’s near [A]at hand
Though we [D]first must walk through [A]the chartless fields yet Christ will be [E]our guide
We will [A]reach the shore of [D]a far off land through [E]a grave on a green [A]hillside
{end_of_verse}
