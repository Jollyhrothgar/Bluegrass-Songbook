{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]I guess we used each other up [C]I guess it's [G]time for us to [C]go
[G]Our separate ways cause the [C]happy days won't [D7]come any more
I can [G]surly say I miss you [C]    I [G]remember how it was [C]before
[G]I ran away what's [C]there to say when we're [D7]not really sure
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Maybe by [C]then I'll see it your way [G]
Maybe [D7]again a light will [G]shine

And [D7]we'll call it yours and [C]mine [G]  [C]  maybe by [G]then

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I really thought we had it [C]together I guess it's [G]natural to disa[C]gree
But it's [G]sad when a heart can't [C]count on a [D7]thing like you and me
I al[G]ready know I [C]need you I'll be [G]comparing then to[C]night
But who [G]knows with time and a [C]long hard climb
It's just [D7]my work out tonight

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]Go ahead now and [D7]say that it's over [G]when love is down let it [C]lie
Just lay your head [D7]upon my shoulder [G]and let’s have a real good cry
It [C]might even bring us a [D7]little bit closer now [G]wouldn't that be so [C]fine
And by the time we broke up there was [D7]love light in our eyes
{end_of_verse}
