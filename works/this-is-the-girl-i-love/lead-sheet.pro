{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
In [G]a church on [C]a [D]mountain far [G]far away
We [C]vowed we’d [D]never part
You [G]kept [C]your promise [D]to honor [G]and obey
But [C]then [D]I broke [G]your heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
If [G]you could see this [C]misery
I [C]know [D]that you’d come home [G]to me
There’s [G]no one else I’d [C]rather have
To [C]have [D]your love I’d be [G]so proud [F]to say
This [C]is [D]the girl [G]I love
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
What [G]can [C]I do [D]dear, what [G]can I say
To [C]make you change [D]your mind
If [G]I [C]could [D]only have [G]another chance
I’d [C]never [D]leave [G]you behind
{end_of_verse}
