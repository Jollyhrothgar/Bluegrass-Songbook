To [F]find a way to [C]Santa Fe [D7]across the Texas [G7]plains

The [F]water holes were [C]few

The lightning flashes and the thunder crashed 
Gave [F]way to a cooling [C]rain
And [F]now the grass is [C]green at last
Out [D7]on the Texas [G7]Plains

[C]Longhorns graze and the dusty haze
But [F]none of the old [C]remain
The [F]bison died for the [C]price of a hide
[G7]Out on the Texas [C]plain
