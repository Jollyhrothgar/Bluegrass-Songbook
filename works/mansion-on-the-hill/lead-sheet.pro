{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Tonight [C]down [G7]here in [C]the valley
I’m [C7]lonesome [F]and oh [C]how I feel
As I sit here [C7]alone in [F]my cabin
I can [C]see [G7]your mansion on [C]the hill
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Do you [G7]recall when [C]we parted
The [C7]story [F]to me [C]you revealed
You said you could [C7]live [F]without love dear
In your [C]loveless [G7]mansion on [C]the hill
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I’ve waited [G7]all through [C]the years love
To give [C7]you [F]a heart true [C]and real
‘Cause I know you [C7]are living [F]in sorrow
In your [C]loveless [G7]mansion on [C]the hill
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
The lights shine [G7]bright from [C]your window
The trees [C7]stand [F]so silent [C]and still
I know you’re [C7]alone with [F]your pride dear
In your [C]loveless [G7]mansion on [C]the hill
{end_of_verse}
