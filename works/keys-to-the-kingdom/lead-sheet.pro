{start_of_verse}
They called old John from the island
And they put him in the kettle to boil
And the Lord came down from heaven above
And they tell me that the oil wouldn’t boil
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Oh he had the keys to the kingdom
And the faith unlocked the door
Oh he had the keys to the kingdom Lord
And the world couldn’t do him no harm
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
The king said to the Hebrew
When they were about to sound
Before you worship that idol God
Get ready to bow down
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Well they put old Paul and Silas
Down in the jail below
While one did sing and the other did shout
And the angel unlocked the door
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Go get your trumpet Gabriel
And move down by the sea
But don’t you blow that trumpet
Until you hear from me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
When you think that you’ve been living right
And serving God every day
Just fall down on our bended knees
He’ll hear every word you say
{end_of_verse}
