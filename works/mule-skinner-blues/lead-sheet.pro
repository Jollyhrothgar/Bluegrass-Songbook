{start_of_verse}
Good morning captain good morning son
Do you need another mule skinner
Out on your new road line
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Well I like to work I’m rolling all the time
Lord I like to work boy I’m rolling all the time
I can pop my initials Right on a mule’s behind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Well it’s hey little water boy bring your water ’round
Lord it’s hey little water boy bring your water ’round
And if you don’t like your job just set that water bucket down
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I work out on the new road from a dollar and a dime a day
Lord I work out on the new road I make a dollar and a dime a day
I’ve got three women on Saturday night Waiting to draw my pay
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Well I’m going to town honey what can I bring you back
Well I’m going to town baby what can I bring you back
Just bring a pint of good rye And a John B.Stetson hat
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Lord it’s raining here and it’s storming on the deep blue sea
Lord it’s raining here and it’s storming on the deep blue sea
Can’t no blonde headed woman make a monkey out for me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
If your house catches fire and there ain’t no water ’round
If your house catches fire and there ain’t no water ’round
Just throw your good gal out the window let your house just burn on down
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Well I’m leaving here and I ain’t gonna take no clothes
I’m leaving here and I ain’t gonna take no clothes
There may be good times in this old town but it’s better on down the road
{end_of_verse}
