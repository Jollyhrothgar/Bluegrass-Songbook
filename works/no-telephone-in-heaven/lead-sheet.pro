{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Now I can’t wait on baby the [D]smiling [A]merchant said
As stooped and softly toyed with his golden curly [E]head
I [A]want to call up mamma came [D]the answer full [A]and free
Will you telephone and ask her when she’s [E]coming back [A]to me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
My child the merchant murmured as he [D]stroked the [A]anxious brow
No telephone connection where your mother lives at [E]now
No [A]telephone in heaven and [D]a tear sprang in [A]her eyes
I thought God had everything with [E]him up in [A]the sky
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Tell her that I get so lonesome that I [D]don’t know what [A]to do
And pappa cries so much I guess he must be lonesome [E]too
Tell [A]her to come to baby cause [D]at night I get [A]so ‘fraid
With no one there to kiss me when the [E]lights begin [A]to fade
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
All through the day I want her since my [D]dolly’s got [A]so sore
With the awful punching brother give it with his little [E]sword
There [A]aint no one to fix it [D]since mamma’s [A]gone away
And poor little lonesome dolly’s getting [E]thinner [A]every day
{end_of_verse}
