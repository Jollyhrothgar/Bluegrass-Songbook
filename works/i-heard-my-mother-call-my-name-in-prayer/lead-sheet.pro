{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
While [Bb]kneeling by her bedside in a cottage on the hill
My [Bb]mother prayed her blessings on me there
She was [Bb]talking there to Jesus while everything was still
and I [Bb]heard my mother [F]call my name in prayer
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Yes I [Bb]heard my mother [F]call my name in prayer
She was pourin [C]out her heart to [C7]Jesus there
Then I Gave my [Bb]heart to him and he saved my soul from sin
For he [Bb]heard my mother [F]call my name in prayer
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
She was [Bb]anxious for her boy to be just what he ought to be
And she asked the Lord to take him in his care
Just the words I can’t remember but I know she prayed for me
For I [Bb]heard my mother [F]call my name in prayer
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
So I [Bb]gave my heart to Jesus and I’m livin now for him
And [Bb]someday I’ll go and meet him in the air
For he [Bb]heard my mother praying and he saved my soul from sin
Yes he [Bb]heard my mother [F]call my name in prayer
{end_of_verse}
