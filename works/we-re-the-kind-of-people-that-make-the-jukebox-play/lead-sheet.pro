{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]Dim lights and the sweet wine a bartender named J[D7]oe
Same hurt on different faces everywhere I [G]go
Sad songs tell the story and [G7]our lips just can't [C]say
That's why we're the kind of [G]people that [D7]make the jukebox [G]play
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
So please sing about their hurt the bitter tears and lonely [D7]sorrow
Passion and pride and things that might have [G]been
How a woman she once loved me then she took her love [D7]away
That's the kind of songs that console my kind each [C]day
And [D7]we're the kind of people that make the jukebox [G]play
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I know it may sound crazy but this dime is my best [D7]friend
It controls that old jukebox when I go drop it [G]in
That old song says everything a [G7]thousand words can't [C]say
That's why we're the kind of [G]people that [D7]make the jukebox [G]play
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
