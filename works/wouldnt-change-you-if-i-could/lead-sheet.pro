{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I [F]wouldn’t change a single thing [C]about you if I could
The way you are just suits me to a [F]tee
A princess in a story [C]book a King upon his throne
That’s what we are and you belong to [F]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [Bb]wouldn’t change you if I [C]could [F]I love you as you are
You’re all that I would wish for if I wished upon a star
An angel sent from heaven you’re everything that’s good
You’re perfect just the [Gm]way you are
I wouldn’t [C]change you if I could
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Your [F]eyes your lips your tehder smile I’d [C]leave them as they are
And come what may I’d never change a [F]thing
And if I were a potter and [C]you a piece of clay
The only thing I’d change would be your [F]name
{end_of_verse}
