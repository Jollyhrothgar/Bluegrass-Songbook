[G7]You say your heart to me is closed and you no longer [C]care
[F]What can I say or do to make you change your mind again
[G7]Oh won't you open up your heart and let forgiveness [C]in

[F]I may pretend I never cry to tell the truth I do
[G7]For sadness came with your goodbye and you're unhappy [C]too
[F]For if it's true you care for me to hide it is a sin
[G7]Oh won't you open up your heart and let forgiveness [C]in
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[F]I'd give the world to hear you say you love me as before
[G7]And that the happy yesterday is ours to live once [C]more
[F]Let's live again the used to be we were so happy then
[G7]Oh won't you open up your heart and let forgiveness [C]in
[G7]Oh won't you open up your heart and let forgiveness [C]in
{end_of_verse}
