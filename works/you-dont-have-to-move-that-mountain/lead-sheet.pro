{start_of_chorus}
You don’t [G]have to move that mountain
Just [C]help me Lord [G]to climb it
You [G]don’t have to move that stumbling block
Just [C]show me the way [G]around it
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
We [G]must climb a great high mountain
To [C]reach Gold’s [G]gracious kingdom
In [G]His words you’ll find the strength
If [C]you will just [G]believe them
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Well the [G]way is filled with pitfalls
And [C]sometimes we [G]may falter
You [G]can have His grace my friend
On your [C]knees down at the altar
{end_of_verse}
