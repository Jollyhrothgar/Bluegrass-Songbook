{start_of_chorus}
I’m waiting tonite for you to tell me that you still love me and you will remain
My heart is breaking with each passing hour please don’t let me love you in vain
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
I used to think your love would always save me and that you’d always stay right by my side
But I can see a change coming o’er you and the tears I cry just can’t hide
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I can’t pretend that love is just a pastime and that you never meant a thing to me
So darlin please don’t leave me all alone sorrounded by your memory
{end_of_verse}
