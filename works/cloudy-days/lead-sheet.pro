{start_of_verse}
Dark clouds hangin’ over me
When will they go away
Rain is in my eyes and I can’t see
Life’s become just cloudy days
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Why she done me like she done
I guess I’ll never know
She knows I need her more than anyone
I made a point to let it show
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Cloudy days don’t the sun ever shine anymore
Stormy weather will you always be around
When I’m down I can’t stand cloudy days
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
I recall a time when times where good
Lord it seems so long ago
But you know they say if the rain won’t come
The grass’ll have no chance to grow
{end_of_verse}
