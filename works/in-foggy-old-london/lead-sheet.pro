{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
In [F]a far away land [Bb]I’m living [F]in dreams
So [F]often at times I’m with you [C]it seems
But [F]I know I am dreaming [Bb]when I think of you
In [F]foggy old [C]London across the [F]deep blue
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Deep [F]blue in the ocean [Bb]it’s so deep [F]and wide
And [F]I’ve got a notion I’ll cross [C]it tonight
And [F]I’ll fly like a [Bb]bluebird up there in [F]the sky
In [F]foggy old London [C]I’ll find my [F]blue eyes
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
When [F]your letter came [Bb]I opened [F]to find
You [F]had been crying while writing [C]each line
But [F]you never mentioned [Bb]no reason [F]for tears
And [F]foggy old London [C]is so far [F]from here
{end_of_verse}
