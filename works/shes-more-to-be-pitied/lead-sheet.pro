{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
She’s [A]there at the bar every evening
Face [A]powdered and cheeks [E]painted red
Her [E]beauty [A]has faded too early
Brought [A]on by [E]the fast life [A]she’s [A7]led
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
She’s [A]more [D]to be pitied [A]than scolded
She [A]needs to be loved [E]not despised
Too [E]much beer [A]and wine, [D]too many [A]good times
The [A]lure of the [E]honky-tonk wrecked her [A]young life
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
She [A]once was the belle of the ballroom
She’d [A]a made some man a [E]sweet [E7]wife
But [E]too [A]many parties, the wrong side of town
Ruined [A]her [E7]happy [A]young life
{end_of_verse}
