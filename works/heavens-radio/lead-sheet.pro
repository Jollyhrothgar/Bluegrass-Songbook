There’s a wonderful invention [D]called the [A]radio
You can hear it every where you chance to [E]go

But it is not so with [E]heaven’s [A]radio
{end_of_verse}

Heaven’s [A]radio on the other shore
For my precious savior always listens [E]in
It’s the [A]same old radio that [D]was used long [A]time ago
For my precious savior always listens [E]in
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Daniel in the lions den with this [D]power should [A]surely win
For my precious savior always listens [E]in
And I [A]know without a doubt [D]honest prayers will bring [A]you out
For my precious savior always listens [E]in
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Well He set the Hebrews three from the [D]fiery [A]furnace free
For my precious savior always listens [E]in

For my precious savior always listens [E]in
