{start_of_verse}
It was in the time of autumn
The golden leaves lay all around
That we laid our dear old father
Away beneath the cold damp ground
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
It seems but a short time ago
That he was in his fullest bloom
But death alas has laid him low
Another victim to the tomb
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
Many sad farewells were given
Many bitter tears were shed
Our sad hearts all beat with anguish
As he lay on his dying bed
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
On a savior’s summons he was readied
On his journey home to go
And fearless drew near the dark valleys
Washed in His blood whiter than snow
{end_of_verse}
