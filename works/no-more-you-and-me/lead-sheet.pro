{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Today something told me not [F]to call [C]you
But with trembling [F]hands I [C]dialed the [G7]telephone
And as it [C]rang the [F]seventh [C]time
I knew I'd lost what [F]once was [C]mine
There'll be [F]no more you and [C]me  [G7]from now [C]on
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
There'll be no more you and [G7]me 
There'll [F]be only [C]misery
Cause you and him me and [C][F]loneliness 
But no [G7]more you and [C]me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I don't have to see his arms [F]wrapped around [C]you
To know you've [F]chos-en [C]him instead of [G7]me
But just to [C]know you'd [F]been with [C]him 
I called the [F]place you'd [C]been
I had to [F]verify the [C]thing  I [G7]couldn't [C]see
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
There'll be no more you and [G7]me 
There'll [F]be only [C]misery
Cause you and him me and [C][F]loneliness 
But no [G7]more you and [C]me
{end_of_verse}
