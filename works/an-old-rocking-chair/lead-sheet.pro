{start_of_verse}
Setting alone in an old rocking chair
I saw an old mother with silvery hair
She seemed so neglected by those who still care
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Her hands were all callused wrinkled and old
A life of hard work was the story they told
And I thought of angels as I saw here there
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Bless her old heart do you think she’d complain
Life has been bitter tho’ she’d live it again
And carry the cress that is more than her share
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
It wouldn’t take much to gladden her heart
Just some small remembrance on somebody’s part
A letter would brighten her empty life there
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I know some youngster’s in an old orphan’s home
Who’d think they owned Heaven if she was their own
They’d never be willing to let her sit there
Rocking alone in an old rocking chair
{end_of_verse}
