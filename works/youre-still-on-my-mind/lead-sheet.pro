{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]The jukebox is playing a [G7]honky tonk [C]song
One more I keep [D7]saying and then I'll go [G]home
What good would it do me I [G7]know what I'll [C]find
An [D7]empty bottle of broken hearts and you're still on my [G]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
The people are laughing and [G7]having their [C]fun
While I sit here [D7]crying over what you have [G]done
My pockets are empty my [G7]last drink of [C]wine
An [D7]empty bottle of broken hearts and your still on my [G]mind
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Alone and forsaken so [G7]blue I could [C]die
I just sit here [D7]drinking till the bottle runs [G]dry
To try and forget you I [G7]turn to the [C]wine
An [D7]empty bottle of broken hearts and your still on my [G]mind
{end_of_verse}
