{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]The life of Hank Williams on [F]earth it was [C]brief
Was loaded with laughter sorry and [G7]grief
De[C]voted his life to [F]bring people [C]joy
Only a few knew Hank [G7]was a sick [C]boy
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
On September 17th 19[F]23 Hank Williams was [C]born
On a farm near Georgiana Alabama
Hank was the younger of two [G7]children
Since his farther was sick from [C]World War One
Hank at the age of [F]9 took it upon himself
To [C]make a living for his family
So Hank started selling peanuts
And [G7]shinning shoes on the [C]street 
For 4 years Hank made a [F]living this way
When he was 13 his [C]family moved to 
Montgomery Alabama
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Hank continued to sell peanuts and shine shoes
He also got a [G7]job on a nearby radio station
[C]Life was quite a struggle for Hank in his [F]early years
While other [C]kids were devoting their time
To school and play Hank was busy making a [G7]living
For his mother [C]father and sister
For about the next ten years
Not much happened to Hank
[F]He was just another [C]country entertainer
Around 1945 he made his first record
Which was [G7]Honky Tonk
From the day on the [C]star begin to shine
And every record [F]from then on
Made the [C]stars shine a little brighter
The last five years that Hank [G7]recorded a song
It [C]automatically became a hit
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[F]I know you all remember the song Lovesick [C]Blues
And Jambalaya and many many others
As strange as it may seem one of his latest
Records was [G7]I'll Never Get Out Of This World Alive 
On the [C]first day of January 195[F]3 Hank Williams 
Passed [C]away in the back seat of his automobile
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
[G7]I was to appear on the [C]same show that day
But the news came first that Hank passed away
When they [F]made the announcement it [C]silenced the crowd
In reverence we stood with our heads bowed
Our hearts were [G7]sad but the show we did play
[C]Cause everyone knew that Hank would
Have [F]wanted it that [C]way
{end_of_verse}
