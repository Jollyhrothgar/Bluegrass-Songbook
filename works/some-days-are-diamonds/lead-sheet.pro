[G]Some days are diamonds [C]some days are [G]stone
Some time the [Em]hard times [A7]won’t leave me [D7]alone
Some times the [G]cold winds  [C]blow a chill in my [G]bones
[Em]Some days are [G]diamonds  [D7]some days are [G]stone

Now the face  that I see [D7]in my [Em]mirror

In [A7]becoming  what I never thought I’d [D7]be
