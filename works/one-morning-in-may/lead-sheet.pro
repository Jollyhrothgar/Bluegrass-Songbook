{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
One [G]morning one [D7]morning [G]in May
I [G]spied a young [D7]couple a making [G]their way
One was a maiden so bright and so fair
The other was a soldier and a brave volunteer
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Good [G]morning good morning [D7]good morning [G]to thee
Oh where are you going my pretty lady
I am a going to the banks of the sea
To [C]see [G]the waters [C]gliding herar [D7]the [G]nightingales sing
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Oh they hadn’t been a standing but a minute or two
When out of his knapsack a fiddle he drew
And the tune he was playing made the valleys all ring
Oh [C]see [G]the [C]waters gliding hear [D7]the [G]nightingales sing
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Pretty lady pretty lady it’s time to give oar
Oh no pretty soldier please play one tune more
For I’d rather hear your fiddle and the touch of one string
Than [C]to [G]see that [C]waters gliding hear [D7]the [G]nightingales sing
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Pretty [G]soldier pretty soldier [D7]will you [G]marry me
Oh [G]no pretty lady [D7]that never [G]can be
I have a wife in old London and children twa three
Two wives in the army too many for me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Well I’ll go back to London and I’ll stay there one year
And often I’ll think of you my little dear
And [G]when I return it [C]will be in [G]the spring
To [C]see [G]the [C]waters gliding hear [D7]the [G]nightingales sing
{end_of_verse}
