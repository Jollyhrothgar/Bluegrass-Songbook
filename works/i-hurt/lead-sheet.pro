{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Darkness falls the [F]night has come [C]I have no place to hide[Em]
For memories [Am]wait and every turn [D7]they won't be [G7]denied
[C]For now I've come to [F]realize how [G7]much you mean to [C]me[Em]
As sadness rolls [F]across my mind [Dm]like waves on an [G7]angry sea
And I [C]hurt
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I held hands with [F]love and trust [C]for[G7]ever [C]
[F]Maybe more than [G7]I was meant to [C]feel
Then I fell out of [F]heaven to the [C]bottom side of [E7]never
[F]Where loneliness is [Dm]all there is that's [G7]real
And I [C]hurt
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
A bird with broken [F]wings will mend [C]given time to fly[Em]
And rivers have a [Am]crossing place [D7]to bridge the other [G7]side
[C]Those of us with [F]broken hearts [G7]finds a place to [C]be [Em]
If time can [F]change the healing power 
[Dm]Then why do willows [G7]weep
Oh I [C]hurt
{end_of_verse}
