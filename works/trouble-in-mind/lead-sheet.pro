{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Trouble [E]in mind [B7]I’m [B7#5]blue
But I [E]won’t be blue [A]always[A7]
‘Cause the [E]sun’s gonna [B7]shine
On my [B7]back door [E]someday[B7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I’m gonna [E]lay down [B7]my head
On some [E]lonesome [A7]railroad line
And let the two-nineteen
Ease [B7]my troubled [E]mind[B7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I’m goin’ [E]down [B7]the river
Gonna [E]take my [A7]rockin’ chair
And if them [E]blues don’t leave me
I’ll rock right out of here
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I’m all alone at midnight
And the lamp is burnin’ low
I’ve [E]never had so much
Trouble [E]in [B7]my [B7#5]life
{end_of_verse}
