{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Oh the years we shared together are so [G7]great in memory 
I don’t think I’ll ever live long [F]enough to be [C]free
For the pleasures of our love was over [G7]shadowed by the pain
So we’ll say goodbye forever I can’t [F]walk that road [C]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
No I’m not looking back [E7]anymore our love was [A7]sweet
But [F]time has [G7]slowly closed the [C]door
Now there’s [E7]thorns where the [A7]flowers once grew
This is the [G7]end for me and [C]you
And I’m [D7]not looking [G7]back any[C]more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
When you know you’ve done the best you can that’s [G7]all that you can do
And I know I did the best I could to [F]get along with [C]you
And if I’d known of something else I would [G7]have tried that too
But I see my mistake one can’t [F]love enough for [C]two
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
No and I’m not looking [E7]back any[A7]more 
If [F]I must live [G7]alone I’ve lived [C]alone before
If life is [E7]lonely let it [A7]be
I’ve still [G7]got what’s left of [C]me
And I’m [D7]not looking [G7]back any[C]more
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
It’s hard to make a new start when the [G7]world has made you old
And the years have made you bitter and [F]heartaches turn you [C]cold
And you keep on turning backwards to the [G7]moments that have fled
A man can’t keep on living with that [F]cloud over his [C]head
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
So I’m not looking [E7]back any[A7]more 
[F]I’ll throw away the [G7]cloths the old [C]times wore
Tomorrow [E7]is another [A7]day 
[F]Perhaps true [G7]love will come my [C]way
{end_of_verse}

And I’m [D7]not looking [G7]back any[C]more
