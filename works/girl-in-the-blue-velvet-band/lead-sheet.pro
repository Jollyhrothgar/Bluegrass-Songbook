{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
One [D]night while [A7]out [D]for a ramble
The [G]hour was just [D]about nine
I [G]met a young maiden [D]in Frisco
On the corner [A7]of Geary [D]and Pine
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
On her face there was [A7]beauty [D]of nature
And [G]her eyes just seemed [D]to expand
Her [G]hair was so rich and [D]so brilliant
Entwined in a [A7]blue [D]velvet band
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
We strolled down the [A7]street [D]together
In my [G]pocket she placed her [D]small hand
She [G]planted the [D]evidence on me
The [G]girl in the blue [D]velvet band
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
I heard the [A7]scream of [D]the siren
And [G]the girl in the blue [D]velvet band
She [G]left me to face all [D]the trouble
With a diamond that [A7]was worth [D]ten grand
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
They sent me to [A7]San Quentin [D]for stealing
God [G]knows I’m an [D]innocent man
The [G]guilty one now she [D]lie’s dying
The [G]girl in the blue [D]velvet band
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Last night [A7]when bed-time [D]was ringin
Standing there close to the bars
I [G]fancied I heard a [D]voice calling
Far out in the [A7]ocean [D]of stars
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
I’ll be out in a [A7]year and [D]I’m leaving
But [G]I’ll carry the name of [C]a man
That [G]served ten years [D]in prison
For the girl in the [A7]blue [D]velvet band
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
And [A7]when I get out [D]I’ll endeavor
To [G]live in some [D]other land
And [G]I’ll bid farewell to [D]old Frisco
And [G]the girl in the blue [D]velvet band
{end_of_verse}
