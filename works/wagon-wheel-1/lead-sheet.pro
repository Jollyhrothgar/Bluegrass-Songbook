H[G]eading down south to the l[D]and of the pines
I'm [Em]thumbing my way into N[C]orth Caroline

R[G]unning from the cold [D]up in New England
I was [Em]born to be a fiddler in an [C]old time string band

W[G]alkin' to the south o[D]ut of Roanoke
I caught a t[Em]rucker out of Philly, had a n[C]ice long toke
But h[G]e's a heading west from the C[D]umberland gap
To J[C]ohnson City, Tennessee
I g[G]otta get a move on b[D]efore the sun
