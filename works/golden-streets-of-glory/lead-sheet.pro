There's a city where the [G7]streets are paved in [C]gold
A [F]land where the [C]milk and the honey [G7]flow
And a [C]mansion waits for me cause my [C7]bible tells the [F]story
I [C]just hope my feet are clean enough
To [F]walk upon the [G7]golden streets of [C]glory

Green meadows where the [G7]little children [C]play
No [F]sorrow there just [C]one long happy [G7]day

I [C]just hope my feet are clean enough
To [F]walk upon the [G7]golden streets of [C]glory

And [G7]when I've reached my journey's end

[C]And the golden streets of my new home
Will [F]lead me up to the Master's throne
[C]With the angel band I'll sing
Glory [F]to His [C]name oh [F]holy ho[C]ly
