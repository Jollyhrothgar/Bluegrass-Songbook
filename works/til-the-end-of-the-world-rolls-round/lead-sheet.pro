{start_of_chorus}
Til [G]the end of the world rolls ’round [C]I’ll keep on loving you
As [D]long as the sun goes up and comes down
And the big blue sky goes down to the ground
As long as the world goes round and round I’ll keep on [G]loving you
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I [G]tried to sail the sea of life I rowed my boat [C]alone
Your [D]love meant nothing to me dear my heart was made [G]of stone
To a harbor filled with loneliness my little boat was [C]moored
And [D]on the day I first met you I fell right [G]overboard
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Whenever [G]you’re around me dear [C]my heart just won’t stand still
And [D]when it comes to kissing you I’ll never get [G]my fill
They said I’d never settle down that I would always [C]roam
That [D]I could never be the type for a loving wife [G]and home
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
So [G]now I know the way I felt was only [C]selfish pride
I [D]thought my heart was fireproof but you burned your way [G]inside
So tell me what I’ve got to do and tell me how it [C]stands
The [D]cards are on the table dear my life is in [G]your hands
{end_of_verse}
