{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]In days gone by I remember dear
The [F]things we used to [C]do
How we [F]laughed and played [C]together [Am]then
And the [D7]skies were always [G7]blue
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But [C]things have changed my darling now
It [F]seems we're miles [C]apart
And [F]remember what I'm [C]sending to [Am]you
Are the [D7]secrets [G7]of my [C]heart
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
We used to sing together then
And [F]never did we [C]quarrel
But [F]things have changed my [C]darling [Am]now 
And [D7]sometimes you seem [G7]cruel
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
What [C]is the matter darling dear
Is it [F]that your love is [C]dead
If [F]this is true my [C]darling[Am]
Please [D7]let it [G7]be un[C]said
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Remember too my darling
That I [F]gave to you my [C]heart
And [F]always will I [C]love you [Am]dear
[D7]Until death do us [G7]part
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
Don't [C]let things change my darling though
Don't [F]ever drift [C]apart
Re[F]member what I'm [C]telling to [Am]you
Are the [D7]secrets [G7]of my [C]heart
{end_of_verse}
