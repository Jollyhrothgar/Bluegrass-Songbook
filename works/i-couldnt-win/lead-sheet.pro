{start_of_verse}
I couldn’t win because she did not love me
She just pretended as she kissed me then
And then about the time I really loved her
She left me and I knew I couldn’t win
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I’m thankful for the happiness she gave me
I wish that I could fall in love again
I don’t blame her I guess I’m just unlucky
But from the start I knew I couldn’t win
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Tonight I sit here drinking in this tavern
And as I order up the drinks again
I see her smiling sweetly at another
If only he just knew that he can’t win
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
A broken heart she must have had in childhood
Now she’s afraid it might happen again
She’s really not to blame for all my heartaches
But from the start I knew I couldn’t win
{end_of_verse}
