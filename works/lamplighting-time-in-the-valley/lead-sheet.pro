{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
Oh there’s [E]a lamp [A]shining bright in [E]the cabin
in a window that’s shining [B]for me
And I [E]know that [A]my mother [E]is praying
for the [B]boy she is longing [E]to [E7]see
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
when it’s [A]lamp lighting time in [E]the valley
in my dreams I go back to my [B]home
Oh I [E]can see that [A]old lamp in [E]the window
it [B]will guide me wherever I [E]roam.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
By the [A]lamplight tonight I [E]can see her
as she rocks in her chair to and [B]fro
Oh she’s praying that I’ll come back to see her
and I know that I never can go.
{end_of_verse}
