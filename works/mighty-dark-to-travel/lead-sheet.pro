{start_of_chorus}
It’s [G]mighty dark for me to travel
For [C]my sweetheart she [G]is gone
The road is rough and filled with gravel
But I must [D7]journey on [G]and on.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
To [G]me she was a little angel
Sent down to me from God above
T’was on [C]the day that I [G]first met her
That I told [D7]her of [G]her love.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Many [G]a night we’d stroll together
Talking of our love so fair
My love for [C]her will [G]never vanish
For I know [D7]I’ll meet [G]her there.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Traveling [G]down this lonesome highway
Thinking of my love that’s gone
Knowing [C]soon we’ll [G]be together
She’s the only [D7]love [G]I’ve known.
{end_of_verse}
