{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
‘Twas [C]battered and scarred and the [G]auctioneer
Thought [C]it scarcely worth [G]his while
To waste much time on the [D]old violin
But [C]he held [Am7]it up with [D]a smile.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
What am I bidden, good folks, he cried
Who will start bidding for me?
A dollar, a dollar – then Two! Only two?
Two dollars, and who’ll make it three?
Three dollars, once; three dollars, twice;
Going for three – But no
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
From the room far back a [D]gray haired man
Came [C]forward [Am]and picked up [D]the bow;
Then [G]wiping the dust from [D]the old violin
And [C]tightening the [Am]loose strings
He [G]played a melody pure [D]and sweet
As sweet as a caroling angel sings.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
The music ceased and the auctioneer
With [Am]a voice [C]that was [G]quiet and low
Said [Em]What am I bidden for [C]the old violin?
And [G]he held it up [D]with the bow.
A thousand dollars, and who’ll make it two?
Two thousand! And [Am]who’ll make it three?
Three thousand once; three thousand, twice;
And  going, and gone! said he.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
The people cheered and some of them cried
We do not understand What changed its worth?
Swift came the reply:
The [C]touch of the [D]master’s [G]hand.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
And many a man with life [D]out of tune
And [C]battered and scattered [G]with sin
Is auctioned cheap to the [D]thoughtless crowd
Much [C]like [Am]the [D]old violin.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
A “mess of pottage  a glass of wine;
A game – and he travels on.
He’s “going” once and ” going” twice
He’s “going” and “almost gone.”
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
But [G]the Master comes and the [D]foolish crowd
Never can quite understand
The [D]worth of a soul and the change that’s wrought
By [C]the touch of the [D]Master’s [G]hand.
{end_of_verse}
