{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[G]We were waltzing that night in Kentucky
[D]‘Neath the beautiful harvest moon
[D]And I was the boy who was lucky
[G]But it all ended too soon
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G]As I sit here alone in the moonlight
[D]I can see your smiling face
[D]And I long once more for your embrace
[D]In that beautiful Kentucky [G]waltz
{end_of_verse}
