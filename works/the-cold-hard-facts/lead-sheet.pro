{start_of_verse}
Don’t run to me when he’s not around
Don’t come slippin’ ’round my door
I tried not to see how you’re using me
We played that little game before
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
You call me up when he’s out of town
The next day you treat me like I’m just some hand me down
Is that any way for a good girl to act
I guess I’ll have to face the cold hard facts
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse}
Day after day of livin’ this a-way
Will take a toll on a man
And night after night lie after lie
Stringin’ me along must be your plan
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Well fools like me they never see
That empty feelin’ that’s in store
When the bitter truth sneaks up on you
She’s headin’ home cut out your door
{end_of_verse}
