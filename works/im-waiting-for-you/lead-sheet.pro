{start_of_verse}
I’m beggin’ to you and I want to go with you
You’re breakin’ my heart as you say goodbye
I hope and I pray we’ll soon be together
My heart is so full it’s hard not to cry
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
What will I do when the leaves start fallin’
The far distant hill will make me feel blue
Soon the flowers will die don’t let love die with them
And with you gone dear what will I do
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Your sweet ruby lips and hair like an angel
And your mournful eyes they keep haunting me
But to know that you’re mine it makes life worth livin’
Oh the times gone by are sweet memories
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
I’m trusting in you but each hour seems longer
I’m counting the days when I’ll be with you
Our hearts are entwined they’re blessed with the future
A safe journey home I’m waiting for you
{end_of_verse}
