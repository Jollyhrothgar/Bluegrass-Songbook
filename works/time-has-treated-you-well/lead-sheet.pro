{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Is that you  [F]I can't believe my [C]eyes
Is that you with that [Am]long curly hair and [D7]dark hazel [G7]eyes
It's been [C]so long but it's [C7]easy to [F]tell [C]   [F]
That [C]time  [G7]has treated you [C]well
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[G7]I spend my [C]nights  [F]with the rest of the [C]guys
Don't look at the [Am]grey in my hair and the [D7]age in my [G7]eyes
The [C]years went by I won't [C7]say my spirits [F]fell [C]   [F]
But I will say [C]time  [G7]has treated you [C]well
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
[Am]How many years went [F]by since the [C]good ole days
[Am]How many years went [F]by since you [G7]turned me away
I [C]swore  [F]I'd never let you [C]know
And the way that I [Am]felt when you [D7]left would never [G7]show
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
But [C]I don't want to waste your night with the [C7]stories I could [F]tell [C]   [F]
So I'll just say [C]time  [G7]has treated you [C]well
[F]So happy that [C]time  [G7]has treated you [F]wel[C]l
{end_of_verse}
