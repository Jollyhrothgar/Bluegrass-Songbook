{start_of_verse}
Goin up I’m goin’ way up
Just to see my Savior there
Goin up I’m goin’ way up
Let Him free my soul from sin
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
There’s a man who is standing at the pearly gates
And I know He’ll let me in
For I’m goin’ there to see my Savior
Let  Him free my soul from sin
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Oh I want to be ready when He calls for me
I want to wear a long white robe
I want to wear those golden slippers on my feet
When He calls me I must go
{end_of_verse}
