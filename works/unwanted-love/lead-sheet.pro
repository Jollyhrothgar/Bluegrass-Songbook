{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I’m [Bb]wanting someone that’s loved [Eb]and lost
Someone [F]that’s known the thrill and paid [Bb]the cost
Someone [Bb]that says they’ll never take [Eb]a chance
On [F]another broken heart, lies, false [Bb]romance
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Wanted [Bb]an [Eb]unwanted love
To [F]share all the misery [Bb]and pain
Of a [Bb]heart that’s unwanted [Eb]and loved
And [F]unwilling to [Bb]gamble again
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
I [Bb]don’t want to love again [Eb]I’m sure
Someone [F]whose love is not [Bb]sincere
I [Bb]don’t want someone who [Eb]hasn’t known
How [F]it feels to love and be [Bb]alone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I [Bb]know there are others [Eb]like me
Alone, [F]footloose and [Bb]fancy free
Yet [Bb]chained to a love they’ll [Eb]never claim
And [F]afraid to ever [Bb]love again
{end_of_verse}
