{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I’d rather be a poor man’s [C7]woman
And be [F]all he has in [C]life
Than to be just one more possession 
In a lonely [G7]rich man’s [C]life
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
When I wake up he’s beside [C7]me
After [F]years love’s still the [C]same
I watch his blue eyes quietly open
I hear his two lips [G7]call my [C]name

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Lord my poor man really loves [C7]me
I’m all [F]he has to his [C]name
But when he holds me closer to him
That means more to me than [G7]fortune or [C]fame
