[C]You’re somebody else’s heartache but I [G7]wanna call you mine
I’d give the world to have you and to [C]hold you one more time
Your [F]pretty smile sweeter ways [C]always makes me pine

But you’re [C]somebody else’s problem a [F]problem I couldn’t find
You’re [G7]somebody else’s heartache not [C]mine
