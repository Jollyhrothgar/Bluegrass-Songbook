{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I [C]was sad and blue, [F]down hearted too
It [C]seemed like my whole world [G7]was lost
When [C]I took a chance, [F]and happened to dance
To the [C]tune of [G7]the [C]Alabama [C7]waltz.
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Waltz, [F]Waltz, [C]the Alabama waltz
Where [D7]all my fears [G7]and troubles were lost
There [C]in your arms, [F]with all of your charms
We [C]danced to [G7]the [C]Alabama waltz.
{end_of_verse}
