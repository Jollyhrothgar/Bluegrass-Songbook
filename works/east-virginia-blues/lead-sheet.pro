{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I was [C]born in East Virginia
North [F]Carolina I did [C]go
There I [F]courted a fair young [C]maiden
But her age I did not [C]know
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Oh [C]her hair was dark and curly
And [F]her cheeks were [C]rosy red
On her [F]breast she wore white [C]lilies
Where I longed to lay my head
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Molly dear  go ask your mother
If you my bride might ever be
If she says no come back and tell me
And I’ll run away with thee
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
No I’ll not go ask my mother
Where she lies on her bed of rest
In her hand she holds a dagger
To kill the man that I love best
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
The ocean’s deep and I can’t wade it
And I have no wings to fly
I’ll just get some blue-eyed boatman
For to row me o’er the tide
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
I don’t want your green back dollar
I don’t want your watch and chain
All I want is you my darling
Say you’ll take me back again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 7}
I’ll go back to East Virginia
North [F]Carolina ain’t my [C]home
I’ll go back to East Virginia
Leave old North Carolina alone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 8}
Oh you know I’d like to see you
At my [F]door you’re welcome [C]in
At my [F]gate I’ll always [C]greet you
For you’re the girl I [G]tried to win
{end_of_verse}
