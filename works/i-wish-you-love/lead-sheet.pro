{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]No more to kiss [G7]you 
And call you my [C]own
Now my [F]arms will be so [C]empty 
When you leave me here [G7]alone
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Still my heart [C]holds sweet [G7]moments 
To keep dreaming [C]on
So [F]goodbye and please [C]remember 
That [G7]I wish you [C]love
{end_of_verse}

[F]May your heart be filled with happiness 
[C]When he kisses you goodnight
I’ll be somewhere in the [D7]loneliness 
Hoping things turn out [G7]all right
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
[C]For I’ve had my share of [G7]heaven 
Tasted lips sent from up [C]above
And my [F]loss is his good [C]fortune 
But [G7]I wish you [C]love
