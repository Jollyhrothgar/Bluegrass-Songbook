{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I'm a lady's man oh yes-sir-ee
I [F]like the gals and the gals like me
[C]Can I make 'em swoon oh yes [G7]I can
Don't [C]know what it is about me they love
But [F]what it is I got plenty of
Make [C]way for me I'm [G7]a loving lady's [C]man

I'm a [F]Lady's Man and that's no crime
I [C]like 'em 'round me all of the time
I've [D7]got a line of talk they [G7]understand
Now [C]you may like a baseball game
But [F]as for me that's much too tame
I [C]get my thrill just [G]being a lady's [C]man
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Been a Lady's Man since I was three
The women used to bounce me on [F]their knee
[C]They would always say when he grows up watch [G7]out
When the gals see his big [C]blue eyes
They'll hang around like a bunch of [F]flies
Those [C]women knew what [G7]they were talking [C]about

I'm a Lady's Man I get the [F]breaks
I guess I've got [C]everything it takes
When [D7]it come to loving they like my [G7]brand
Oh the gals won't leave [C]me alone
I have to disconnect [F]my phone
That's [C]how it is [G7]when you're a lady's [C]man
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
I'm a lady's man oh yes-sir-ee
I love the gals and the [F]gals love me

Oh I like 'em short I like [C]'em tall
As a mater of fact I love [F]'em all
Make [C]way for me [G7]I'm a loving lady's [C]man
