{start_of_verse}
I once did have a dear companion
Indeed I thought his love my own
Until a dark eyed girl betrayed me
And then he cares no more for me
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Just go and leave me if you wish to
It will never trouble me
For in your heart you love another
And in my grave I’d rather be
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
Last night you were sweetly sleeping
Dreaming in some sweet repose
While I, a poor girl, broken hearted
Listened to the wind that blows
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse}
When I see your babe a laughing
It makes me think of your sweet face
But when I see your babe a crying
It makes me think of my disgrace
{end_of_verse}
