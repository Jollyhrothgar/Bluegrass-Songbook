{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
My [G]Sophronie’s from Kentucky [C]she’s found another man
Can’t [D]even kiss her can’t [G]even hold her hand

So [D]now I’m just a hotshot with a teardrop in [G]my eye

Love [G]em and leave [C]em, kiss em and grieve em

Til [G]Gabriel blows his bugle I’ll be [C]loving that sweet girl
