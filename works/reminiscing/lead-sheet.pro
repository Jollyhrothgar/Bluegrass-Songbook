[C]I'm just sittin' here reminiscin'
[F]Wonderin' who you've been kissin'
[C]Baby oh-oh [G7]baby
[F]I've been wanderin' all around
There must be a new guy in town
You don't [C]love me any more
I'll get [G7]over you-a-oo baby
Al[F]though my heart's still [C]sore
[F]Well you know my heart's still [C]sore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
When I think of all the lies you told
[F]To that young man my heart you've sold
You're a [C]cheater and a mean mis[G7]treater
When I [F]think of all the fun we had
Kind of makes me feel so sad
I'm [C]lonely for your love
And the longest [G7]day I live
It's [F]only you that I'll be thinkin' [C]of
