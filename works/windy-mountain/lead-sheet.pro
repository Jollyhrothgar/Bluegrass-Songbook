{start_of_chorus}
Oh, [E]how I’d like to be upon a windy mountain
Where the tree tops scrape the [B]sky
Then [E]I would forget all my worries and my troubles
I’ll [A]just let [B]the wind blow [E]them by
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
I [E]how I love the sound of the wind when it’s howlin
For it blows my blues [B]away
It [E]makes me forget the girl that I’m lovin
Lets [A]me forget [B]until [E]another day
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Let [E]me hear the leaves on the trees when they are singing
Just a moment of relief is all [B]care
For [E]I’ve got no sorrow heartaches or sadness
As [A]long as I [B]can see the trees [E]that sway
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Oh, my [E]friends bury me a way up on the mountain
Where that old wind will always [B]blow
For [E]I want to rest alone on the mountain
With [A]the [B]howlin wind that I [E]love so
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Tell [E]my old lover in care you should see her
Just how much I love her she’ll never [B]know
And [E]that I’ve gone to rest away upon the mountain
Where [A]the [B]howling wind will [E]always blow
{end_of_verse}
