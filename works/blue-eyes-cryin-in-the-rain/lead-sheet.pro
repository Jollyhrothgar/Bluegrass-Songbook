{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
In [G]the twilight glow I see her
Blue [D]eyes cryin’ in [G]the rain
When we kissed goodbye and parted
I [D]knew we’d never meet [G]again
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
Love [C]is like a dying ember
And [G]only [D7]memories remain
And [G]through the ages I’ll remember
Blue [D]eyes cryin’ in [G]the rain.
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Someday [C]when we meet up yonder
We’ll [G]stroll hand in hand [D]again
In [G]the land that knows no parting
Or [D]blue eyes cryin’ in [G]the rain.
{end_of_verse}
