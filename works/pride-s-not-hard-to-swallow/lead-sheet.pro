{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I wish you'd look who's [F]crawling back to [C]you
I never thought I'd [F]live to see [G7]today
I [C]swore to you the [F]day I left this [C]time I'd go for good
And [D7]I was even proud enough to [G7]tell myself I could
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But it [C]took a lot of [F]lonely nights to [C]ever change my mind
It took a lot of [F]missing you and [D7]things that I'd left [G7]behind
In[C]tending to keep [F]going but the [C]going got too [F]rough
And [C]pride's not hard to swallow once you [F]chew it [G7]long [C]enough
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
I know we won't always [F]see eye to [C]eye
But if you'll take me back this [F]time I'll really [G7]try
So [C]many things I [F]could have done so [C]much I failed to do
I've [D7]never needed anyone as [G7]much as I need you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
But it [C]took a lot of [F]lonely nights to [C]ever change my mind
It took a lot of [F]missing you and [D7]things that I'd left [G7]behind
In[C]tending to keep [F]going but the [C]going got too [F]rough
And [C]pride's not hard to swallow once you [F]chew it [G7]long [C]enough
