I can’t answer her letter
For she left me no address
You should know my little darling
You [G]left my [D]poor heart in [G]distress
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus}
I [G]got a letter from my darling
She [G]said she hated to [D]go
It [G]broke my heart the words she wrote me
She [G]closed by [D]saying I love you [G]so
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
She [G]wrote the words she knew would hurt me
She [G]said I never could be [D]true
I’ve [G]tried I’ve tried my little darling
To [G]prove my [D]love was just for [G]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
This [G]letter meant goodbye forever
Though [G]we’ll have each [D]other’s hearts
Our [G]love will fade away in sadness
Precious [G]one [D]why did we have to [G]part
