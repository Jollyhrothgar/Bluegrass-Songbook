A broken heart heartache's nothin' but [F]blue days
Just [G7]left here with tears dear to [C]flow

I thought I'd gain the whole wide world my [F]dear when I met [C]you
Not [G7]dreamin' that somebody else might [C]feel the same way too
You made my life a pleasure and you'd turn my gray skies [F]blue
But now my soul is [C]dying cause you [G7]say I'm number [C]two

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
Oh please accept these thanks my dear for [F]being so kind to [C]me
It [G7]seemed all heaven smiled until you [C]said you wasn't free
My ship has sailed my life has failed my door is closed [F]today
Because the things I [C]thought I had have [G7]all been taken [C]away
{end_of_verse}
