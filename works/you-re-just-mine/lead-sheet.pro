{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]I know [G7]that it's [C]so you can never ever be [G7]mine
I can't stand it when you go I'll have a troubled [C]mind
You're [G7]my only [C]love [C7]you're my every[F]thing
It's hard to know sweet[C]heart it's so
You're just [G7]mine only in my [C]dreams
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Sweetheart you're [G7]going a[C]way and there's nothing I can [G7]do 
And when I'm old and gray I'll still feel the same way for [C]you
There's [G7]nobody [C]else for [C7]me there's no [F]doubt
When God made mates for [C]everyone I [G7]guess He left me [C]out
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
The skies [G7]are so [C]blue when I'm by your [G7]side
I'm happy dear with you I'm oh so satis[C]fied
You're [G7]my only [C]one that's [C7]what your loving [F]means
But tears fill my eyes when [C]I realize 
You're just [G7]mine only in my [C]dreams
{end_of_verse}
