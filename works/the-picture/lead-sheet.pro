The Picture
Record by Ricky Van Shelton
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
[C]You say your man is every[G7]thing you ever [C]dreamed of
He's everything that you [G7]wanted me to [C]be
And from looking at this photograph 
[F]I can see without a doubt
[C]Oh you have a [G7]perfect fami[C]ly
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
All at [F]once I see me in the [C]picture 
Holding [F]you and that little baby [C]boy [G7]
His [C]hair would have been blonder 
And his [F]eyes would have been blue
If that was [C]me in the [G7]picture with [C]you [G7]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 4}
With all [C]respect I didn't [G7]mean to show my [C]feelings
I'm thinking things that I [G7]have no right to [C]say
Someone ought to write a song 
Of [F]wandering boys who can't come home
And [C]how they let the [G7]best things slip [C]away
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 5}
Once [F]again I see me in the [C]picture 
Holding [F]you and that little baby [C]boy [G7]
His [C]hair would have been blonder 
And his [F]eyes would have been blue
If that was [C]me in the [G7]picture with [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 6}
[F]If that was [C]me in the [G7]picture with [C]you
{end_of_verse}
