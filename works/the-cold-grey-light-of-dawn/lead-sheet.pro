{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]The light of dawn screams a yell starting [F]another day of [C]hell 
Facing a world I can't face with you [G7]gone
In the [C]mirror I can see a stranger [F]looking back at [C]me 
And I turn blue in the [G7]cold grey light of [C]dawn
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
Neon [F]lights and the jukebox help ease me through the [C]night
I lean hard on the bottle 'til I no longer stand up [G7]right
In the [C]morning in my room I feel [F]like I'm in a [C]tomb
Same old grey walls are coming on again real [G7]strong
Down the [C]road when I drive feeling [F]more dead than [C]alive
And I turn blue in the [G7]cold grey light of [C]dawn
{end_of_verse}
