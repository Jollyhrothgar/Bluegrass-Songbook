{start_of_verse: Verse 1}
[C]Sometimes I go down  to old China [Dm]town
And just walk [G7]around  just wander [C]around
Where amber lights gleam  and blue shadows [Dm]fall
Just dreaming a [G7]dream  of my China [C]doll
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 2}
A silk Chinese coat  a little blue [Dm]fan
Coral pink [G7]lips  and tiny pale [C]hands
Oh my China doll  my lonely tears [Dm]fall
I'll never for[G7]get you never forget you my China [C]doll
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: Verse 3}
Sometimes I go down  and just hang [Dm]around
And just hang [G7]around  a boat China [C]bound
And I'd give the world  to just leave it [Dm]all
And sail on that [G7]boat  to my China [C]doll
{end_of_verse}
